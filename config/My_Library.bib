  abstract = {Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an inherently serious condition that have a profound physical, psychological, and socioeconomic impact on affected individuals. Recently, the incidence of incomplete SCIs are increasing, and the central nervous system of incomplete injury has the potential of plastic change. Hybrid assistive limb (HAL) is an exoskeleton robot suit that supports walking of persons with motor dysfunction. The effectiveness of HAL training on walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic SCI is still unlear. Aim To investigate the effctiveness of walking tarining with robot suit HAL for walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. Method Fifteen patients with chronic SCI (11 men, 4 women) classified by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) D (zone of partial preservation C4-L3), who received full rehabilitation in the acute and subacute phase of SCI were enrolled. A single case experimental A-B(pre-post) design study by repeated assessments of the same patients. The subjects performed 3 to 6 months (30 minutes per session, 2 times per week) HAL training with walker and supported by physical therapists. Functional outcome measures included 10-m walk test(10MWT), 6-minute walk test(6MWT), Berg balance scale(BBS), and the walking index for SCIII(WISCIII), which were evaluated without HAL. Results Twelve patients completed 3 to 6 months HAL training (3 patients dropped out after 6 or 8 sessions). Functional outcome measures were analyzed in those who completed HAL training. The mean walking speed in 10MWT increased from 0.46 +/- 0.37 m/s to 0.73 +/- 0.50 m/s (p{$<$}0.01). The improvement corresponded to a 59\% faster walking than in initial evaluation. Walking distance in 6MWT increased from 127.8 +/- 112.7m to 217.5 +/- 159.1m (p{$<$}0.05). Balance evaluated by BBS also improved from 28.1 +/- 13.4 to 39.8 +/- 11.8 (p{$<$}0.01), and WISCIII from 13.8 +/- 5.1 to 17.0 +/- 2.6 (p{$<$}0.05). Discussion and Conclusion Our results suggest that HAL training could improve walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic SCI. In the past, rehabilitation for SCI focused not on functional improvement, but on compensation for impairment. HAL would facilitate motor recovery and improve mobility in chronic SCI, and may play an important role in rehabilitation for SCI in future. Further controlled studies should be needed. It is very important that people who are in need of assistive products utilise those products in their daily life. In the first part of this symposium a keynote lecture will be made by a Japanese opinion leader who is an AT development director of a national institute, and is recommended by The Rehabilitation Engineering Society of Japan (RESJA). He will talk about the current situation of assistive products development and use in Japan which is the most aged society in the world. In his speech a research project is introduced which focuses relationship of assistive products use and daily activities of older people including nonagenarians and centenarians. A panel discussion will be held in the second part of the symposium. Remarkable panelists from WHO and Japan make short presentations about the circumstances of people with disabilities or the elders and usage status of assistive products in Southeast Asian and other countries. After the short reports, the organisers from WHO and NRCPD develop discussions with the panelists about better practice of AT use or methods to improve access to high-quality affordable AT. Statement of the objective / learning objectives The aim is to bring deeper understanding among opinion leaders in P\&O / Assistive Technology fields. The audience can learn the current situations of AT and be inspired to support AT development and dissemination. The Symposium 'Assistive Technologies against Ageing Society' on Sunday, 6 October 2019, consists of two presentations with the first one taking place from 13:00 - 14:15 and the second one continuing from 14:30 - 15:45. Background The Australian Orthotic Prosthetic Association (AOPA) regulates the profession of orthotist/prosthetists in Australia through the establishment, maintenance and application of professional standards, such as competency standards. While portfolios are commonly used to assess professional competency, little research has investigated how reliable these assessments are, or how reliability can be improved. Aim To evaluate how reliable AOPA's competency portfolio assessment is and examine causes of variation to improve reliability. Method Overseas trained practitioners wishing to have their qualifications and experience recognised by AOPA submitted a portfolio for assessment. Portfolios were randomly assigned to two independent assessors who determined whether the applicant's portfolio demonstrates competency against each of the 68 AOPA Competency Standards (2014) and recorded their determination as "satisfied" or "not satisfied". An administrator collated the independent evaluations and identified any points of disagreement for discussion at a consensus meeting. To quantify interassessor reliability, the Kappa statistic was used for each of the 68 competency standards. To better understand the reasons for disagreement, semi-structured interviews were conducted with each assessor. Results Results from this study show high rates of agreement between assessors upon independent assessment. Points of disagreement were commonly resolved during the consensus meeting between assessors, disagreement was rare. The standards which experienced the highest rates of disagreement were identified. Discussion and Conclusion Evidence based standards should be supported by evidence-based processes. Competency assessment via a portfolio of evidence can be conducted and assessed by two assessors with high levels of agreement. Factors that may increase the reliability of the assessment include; appropriate assessor training, the presence of a consensus meeting and clear standards. There are opportunities to further improve the clarity of standards identified as having the lowest level of agreement. Background Evidence highlights that a major factor associated with inappropriate wheelchair distribution is the global shortage of wheelchair service provision education and training.[1-4] The World Health Organization Guidelines on the provision of manual wheelchairs in less-resourced settingsrecommend integrating wheelchair service provision content into existing academic rehabilitation programs.[1] However, a 2017 study reported limited training time allocated to wheelchair service provision in some professional rehabilitation programs in low-, middle- and high-income countries.(4) Aim To develop an evidence-based online Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (SMART) through a mixed-methods approach to identify necessary components and investigate preliminary impact. Method Data was collected from 3 primary data sources, including an international wheelchair education survey, qualitative interview transcripts with representatives from health care professional university programs and wheelchair education integration 'pilot sites'. Data sources were analyzed using a deductive content analysis approach to produce the Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (SMART). Subsequent analyses of SMART analytics and purposive interviews were performed to identify how the toolkit was used in a variety of settings across different types of academic rehabilitation programs and contexts. Results We received 72 responses on our international wheelchair education survey, conducted 14 qualitative interviews with health care professional university program representatives, and hosted 16 presentations from wheelchair education integration 'pilot sites' to identify integration challenges. Themes emerged related to having minimal resources (human, financial, clinical, equipment), unawareness of open-source educational materials, and lack of trained personnel to name a few. Therefore, SMART was developed and includes educational resources (e.g., syllabi, presentations, online modules, evidence-based training packages, labs, evaluations) and strategies to overcome barriers to integrating wheelchair content into curricula. Analytics reveal SMART pages have been accessed 11,703 times globally, and since its launch in April 2018, the average number of pages viewed per session have increased by 7.4\%. The interview findings suggest SMART has potential to improve the wheelchair education provided in terms of pedagogic approach, content and resources used. Discussion and Conclusion SMART may facilitate the integration of wheelchair content into health care professional university curricula. Ultimately, improved education in this important area of practice may enhance the participation and quality of life of those individuals who use a wheelchair for mobility. Prosthetics and orthotics training programs may consider using globally available resources, such as SMART, to identify strategies to improve wheelchair education and to advocate for their implementation. Background Nowadays is well known that voice-activated wheelchairs help the quadriplegic get around, and houses can be equipped with similar systems to operate lights and appliances; but which are the options when besides quadriplegic there is no way to give voice commands to the wheelchair or to communicate our desires to other people. The first approach of this project was presented in the International Workshop on Wearable Robotics (WeRob 2014) and a new version in WeRob 2017[2]. Aim Provide an alternative to quadriplegic persons in order to give commands from eye blinking and communicate with outside world through Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities incorporated in a wheelchair. Method To fulfill the aim of the project, the engineering design method was followed which as first step includes the definition of a clear problem statement, then pertinent information was gathered in order to generate multiple solutions. Afterwards, the information was analyzed, a solution was selected, tested and implemented. Two approaches have been generated previously (WeRob 2014, 2017), the first one was developed with a neural signal reading device and a Bluetooth communication board; afterwards a new alternative was evaluated including eye blinking commands. Now, a faster microcontroller with IoT capabilities has been incorporated in the design process to include IoT capabilities. Results Taking a decision considering commands coming from eye blinking, to give mobility to a wheelchair, is not a simple task, bad decisions can end up in moving a person in a wrong direction which will give more difficulties instead of solutions. In the actual study a faster microcontroller with embedded software and hardware for IoT is used, this device can manage multiple sensors as inputs and multiple actuators as outputs. The raspberry Pi 3 was selected because it is single-board computer with wireless LAN and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on board. The developed system discriminates an involuntary blinking from a low motion voluntary blinking and take a decision to move forward a model wheelchair. The position and given commands are sent to an IoT platform to save the wheelchair movement data. Discussion and Conclusion A single board computer with on board wireless LAN and Bluetooth gives more possibilities to incorporate IoT capabilities for decision-making about wheelchair movement, and besides that voluntary blinking recognition is detected with precision and faster. The developed system fulfils the aim to provide an alternative to quadriplegic persons in order to give commands from eye blinking and communicate with outside world through IoT capabilities incorporated in a wheelchair. Background Most cervical cord injury (CCI) people need to use a wheelchair in daily life [1]. Especially, C5-C6 level of CCI patients can't usually perform the extension movement of elbow joint so that they can't operate the wheelchair strongly. Previously, we have developed the motion assist robot, which is named Active Cast (AC) for the upper limbs to transmit their residual function around shoulder to hand operations [2]. Aim The purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of wearing AC on the musculoskeletal of their residual function during wheelchair operation by people with different symptoms of CCI. Method Two subjects with C6B1(right), C5B(left) and C6B2(both) of the Zancolli classification were participated in this evaluation experiment. The treadmill was set to reproduce the running on a slope. The inclination was set to 3\% for the C5 level CCI subject, and 4\% for the C6 level CCI subject in order to confirm that the musculoskeletal of their residual functions better. We used the 3D motion analysis system and a myoelectric potentiometer for the analysis during 20 [s] wheelchair operation. From the above, the effect of AC on residual muscles of CCI subjects with different symptoms was analyzed. Results Based on the experimental results without AC, we confirmed that the C5 level subject operated the wheelchair using the elbow flexion force, and the C6 level subject used the force of the pronation of forearm. On the other hand, from the results with AC, in the case of C5 level subject, the scapula elevated greatly due to locking the elbow joint, and the amount of activity of the upper trapezius muscle also increased comparing with the case without AC. In the case of C6 level subject, we confirmed that the amount of scapula abduction increased, and the serratus anterior muscle was also exerted. Discussion and Conclusion It was revealed that wearing AC induced motions and residual muscles around the shoulder of CCI subjects with different symptoms. In C5 level CCI, it was confirmed that the elevation movement of the scapula was induced, and in the C6 level CCI, the abduction motion of the scapula was induced. It was confirmed that the effect of AC differs by symptoms with the pronation of forearm. Background Patients with complete paraplegia after spinal cord injury (SCI) are difficult to walk by themselves. Gait training with conventional orthoses for complete paraplegia requires excessive upper limb usage and is difficult to train knee extensor during ambulation. We developed a new method of HAL using remaining muscle activation as a trigger for paralyzed limb, and we called heterotopic HAL method (T-HAL). Aim This study aims to describe voluntary gait and voluntary knee extension using Heterotopic Triggered HAL method in patients with complete quadri/paraplegia after chronic SCI. Method Nine patients, 20-67 years old, C6-T11, AIS A-B, were enrolled in this study. HAL session consisted of two parts: the first session was voluntary ambulation using upper limb triggered HAL (UT-HAL method). In addition, for cases who could contract hip flexor, the second session was done for active knee extension using hip flexor activation. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to evaluate muscle activity of hip flexor and quadriceps femoris (Quad) in synchronization with a Vicon motion capture system. The modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score was evaluated before and after each session. Results There were not seen severe complications such as hypoautonomic hyperreflexia, or symptomatic venous vein thrombosis, etc. The only observed adverse event was redness caused by contact between the skin and harness in cases 1, 2, and 3 which was avoidable by using a cushion. In three cases, from C6 to T6, MAS score significantly decreased after each session. In all cases, EMG before the intervention showed no activation in either Quad. However, periodic activation of the lower limb muscles was seen during UT-HAL ambulation. In two cases, in T10-11, there was observed active contraction in both Quads and hip flexors after intervention. Discussion and Conclusion We focused on residual upper limb muscle activity and the coordination between the upper limbs and contralateral lower limbs in natural gait. We observed neurological positive changes in two cases after the intervention. Moreover, patients with cervical cord or upper thoracic cord injuries, who have difficulty performing conventional gait training with orthoses, may experience decreased spasticity and activation of paralyzed muscles. These findings suggest that T-HAL method is a feasible option for rehabilitation for complete quadri/paraplegia with chronic SCI. Background Using a seat cushion, we feel the situation where the protrusion of the ischium hits the bottom of the cushion. At the pressure measuring time, the phenomenon that the peak pressure value gradually increases is observed. In prevention of pressure sores, it is important to elucidate the mechanism of bottoming phenomenon. The pressure distribution response characteristics when continuously using various seat cushions were studied in the human body and human body model. Aim It was aimed to investigate whether the bottom was due to a change in the condition in the seat cushion or a change in the internal pressure in the human body. Method Seven seat cushions were prepared on the wheelchair. Subjects were two healthy adult male and a biological model. The biological model was made from plastic bone specimens and silicone materials (170 cm, 32 kg). Each cushion was placed on the plate seating surface of a wheelchair (Netti em, Alu Rehab AS) set at a tilt angle of 0 degrees and a reclining angle of 95 degrees, and a pressure distribution measuring device was laid on top(Xsensor X 3 Pro, Xsensor Technology Corp.). Measurements were carried out, with the human body and human body model sitting still at the pelvis intermediate position, randomly on each seat cushion (3 minutes / 4861 frames). Results In each seat cushion, there was a gradual trend of peak pressure after sitting of the human body. On the other hand, this tendency was not observed in the human body model. The difference between the maximum and the minimum value of the peak pressure was significantly higher for each human body than for the human body model. There was no significant difference between the maximum and minimum values of the contact area between human body and human body model. Discussion and Conclusion Local concentration of pressure can not be said to be caused by sinking of humans in the seat cushion or compression of the material. Rather, it is presumed that biological changes occur over time. If compressive stress affects blood flow, in order to distribute body pressure, wheelchair users are required to improve the movement such as push-up and use the wheelchair posture conversion function. Background We are developing Qolo, a new personal mobility device for those with motor disability in their lower limbs. It assists sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit postural transitions as well as navigation in standing posture with hands-free operation. Its mechanism to assist the postural transition is implemented with passive gas springs without using electric actuators, making it compact, light-weight and low cost. Aim The purpose of this study is to report clinical assessment of the device after modification of its design to realize voluntary sit-to-stand posture transition of people with thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI). Method In the improved design of the device, reviewing our preceding clinical experiments, the assistive force of the knee springs was doubled and lumbar assist was added. Six participants with SCI (age: 30-52y, 4 males and 3 females, neurological level: T4-L3, AIS: A-C, MMT Hip Ext.: 0-1, Knee Ext.: 0-3) were asked to conduct stand-up and sit-down postural transitions using the improved version of the device. Feasibility of the assisted motions were evaluated. Results Six out of the seven participants were able to smoothly conduct voluntary stand-up and sit-down motions using the device by themselves, without additional assistance. Two of the them (T10A, T6A, MMT Knee{$<$}=1) achieved voluntary stand-up motion only with the improved version of the device. One participant (T4A, MMT Knee=0) needed additional manual assistance to achieve voluntary stand-up motion using the device. Discussion and Conclusion The improvement of the device extended its capability to assist sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit posture transition of people with lumbar or thoracic level SCI. At the same time, necessity of stronger support for middle to upper thoracic level SCI was investigated. For the next step, we plan to introduce stronger assistive force, and improve of harnessing and attachment and detachment processes to facilitate its daily use. Background Gait enables human beings to move forward, and most people consider gait to be natural skill. But gait disturbances are very prevalent to the patients with burn injury. A major cause of functional impairment including pain and joint contractures. Contractures at the lower extremities such as the hip, knee and ankle significantly limit gait. Recent attention of the application of artificial intelligence in rehabilitation, in particularly lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation has become a hot issue of studies. Aim This study is purposed to find the efficacy and study the mechanism of motor recovery after robot assisted gait training on patients with lower extremity burn. Method 7 patients with lower extremity burn were included. All patients received 4 weeks robot assisted training. Functional scores of functional ambulation category (FAC) and 6-minute walking distances, and pain score of visual analog score (VAS) during robot assisted gait training were measured. Results FAC and VAS scores after training were better than the scores before training. 6-min walking distance after training were significantly increased than the measure before training(p{$<$}0.05). Lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation training improves patient's pain, and increases walking speed on patients with lower extremity burn. Discussion and Conclusion Lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation improves the walking speed, and prolongs their walking distances. The use of robot assisted rehabilitation may facilitate early recovery from burn injury. Background The infant cerebral palsy is one of the most wide-spread reasons of disability at child's age. The success of rehabilitation depends on intensity of kinesitherapy, quality of movements and motivation of the child that is ensured with modern robotized systems with biological feedback. Aim to estimate efficiency of use of robotized systems with biological feedback in rehabilitation of children with infant cerebral palsy. Method The basic and control groups of children (26 persons in each) with spastic paraparesis, flexion positioning of lower extremities, impairment of supportability and walking, matched in functions, age and gender were formed. The course of rehabilitation included: massage, apparatus physiotherapy, therapeutic exercises. The patients of the basic group additionally had mechanotherapy on a robotized system "Lokomat Pediatric" for training strength of muscle, for increasing of amount of movements in joints. The period of observation - 1 year (3 courses of treatment). Efficiency of the given treatment was evaluated with a method of functional testing (Ashworth, GMFCS, GMFM), program testing of a robotized system (L-FORCE, L-ROM) before and after the course of rehabilitation. Results For the period of observation the spasticity of muscles (Ashworth) of lower extremities in patients of both groups reduced, on the average, for 1 point. The level of limitation of the gross motor functions (GMFCS) in both groups didn't change essentially. Motor possibilities (GMFM) of the patients of the basic group increased, on the average, on 25 +/- 7 \%, of the control group - on 12 +/- 7 \%. The isometric strength of muscles - flexors of a knee and a hip (L-FORCE) in the basic group increased, on the average, on 3 Nm, the strength of muscles-extensors of a knee and a hip - on 2 Nm, in the control group - didn't change. The amount of active movements in knee and hip joints (L-ROM) achieved physiological norm in the basic group and in 25 \% of children of the control group. Discussion and Conclusion The mechanotherapy on a robotized system with biological feedback "Lokomat Pediatric" in rehabilitation of children with infant cerebral palsy allows to increase the strength of muscles trained, amount of movements in joints, results in improvement of indexes of functional testing, to increase motivation of children for performing active exercises in game. Motor rehabilitation of patients with infant cerebral palsy with the use of mechanotherapy on a robotized system "Lokomat Pediatric" has shown high efficiency in comparison with traditional methods.},

  abstract = {This Letter describes a search for narrowly resonant new physics using a machine -learning anomaly detection procedure that does not rely on signal simulations for developing the analysis selection. Weakly supervised learning is used to train classifiers directly on data to enhance potential signals. The targeted topology is dijet events and the features used for machine learning are the masses of the two jets. The resulting analysis is essentially a three-dimensional search A -{$>$} BC, for m(A) similar to O(TeV), m(B), m(C) similar to O(100 GeV) and B, C are reconstructed as large-radius jets, without paying a penalty associated with a large trials factor in the scan of the masses of the two jets. The full run 2 root s = 13 TeV pp collision dataset of 139 fb(-1) recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is used for the search. There is no significant evidence of a localized excess in the dijet invariant mass spectrum between 1.8 and 8.2 TeV, Cross-section limits for narrow -width A, B, and C particles vary with m(A), m(B), and m(C). For example, when m(A) = 3 TeV and m(B) greater than or similar to 200 GeV, a production cross section between 1 and 5 fb is excluded at 95\% confidence level, depending on m(C). For certain masses, these limits are up to 10 times more sensitive than those obtained by the inclusive dijet search. These results are complementary to the dedicated searches for the case that B and C are standard model bosons.},

  abstract = {A search for R-parity-violating supersymmetry in final states characterized by high jet multiplicity, at least one isolated light lepton and either zero or at least three b-tagged jets is presented. The search uses 139 fb(-1) of root s = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. The results are interpreted in the context of R-parity-violating supersymmetry models that feature gluino production, top-squark production, or electroweakino production. The dominant sources of background are estimated using a data-driven model, based on observables at medium jet multiplicity, to predict the b-tagged jet multiplicity distribution at the higher jet multiplicities used in the search. Machine-learning techniques are used to reach sensitivity to electroweakino production, extending the data-driven background estimation to the shape of the machine-learning discriminant. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed and exclusion limits at the 95\% confidence level are extracted, reaching as high as 2.4 TeV in gluino mass, 1.35 TeV in top-squark mass, and 320 (365) GeV in higgsino (wino) mass.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) offers robust statistical and probabilistic techniques that can help to make sense of large amounts of data. This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).},

  abstract = {Decision making about discharge destination for critically ill patients is a highly subjective and multidisciplinary process, heavily reliant on the ICU care team, patients and their caregivers' preferences, resource demand, staffing, and bed capacity. Timely identification of discharge disposition can be useful in care planning, and as a surrogate for functional status outcomes following critical illness. Although prior research has proposed methods to predict discharge destination in a critical care setting, they are limited in scope and in the generalizability of their findings. We proposed and implemented different machine learning architectures to determine the efficacy of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score as well as the patient characteristics that comprise it to predict the discharge destination for critically ill patients within 24 hours of ICU admission. We conducted a retrospective study of ICU admissions within the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) populated with de-identified clinical data from adult patients admitted to an ICU between 2014 and 2015. Machine learning models were developed to predict four discharge categories: death, home, nursing facility, and rehabilitation. These models were trained and tested on 115,248 unique ICU admissions. To mitigate class imbalance, we used synthetic minority over-sampling techniques. Hierarchical and ensemble classifiers were used to further study the impact of imbalanced testing set on the performance of our predictive models. Amongst all of the tested models, XGBoost provided the best discrimination performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90\% (recall: 71\%, F1: 70\%). Our findings indicate that the variables used in the APACHE IV model for estimating patient severity of illness are better predictors of hospital discharge destination than the APACHE IV score alone. Incorporating these models into clinical decision support systems may assist patients, caregivers, and the ICU team to begin disposition planning as early as possible during the hospitalization.},

Such criteria include whether principled approaches from machine learning can be used to increase accuracy and robustness and to represent uncertainty, whether data and model integration can be performed or whether temporal evolution can be modeled to implement retriage or represent medication responses. Following the most important criteria, we explore current systems and identify some missing features that, if added, may yield to more accurate triage systems. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background: Telemonitoring of home blood pressure (BP) is found to have a positive effect on BP control. Delivering a BP telemonitoring service in primary care offers primary care physicians an innovative approach toward management of their patients with hypertension. However, little is known about patients' acceptance of such service in routine clinical care. Objective: This study aimed to explore patients' acceptance of a BP telemonitoring service delivered in primary care based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). Methods: A qualitative study design was used. Primary care patients with uncontrolled office BP who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled into a BP telemonitoring service offered between the period August 2012 and September 2012. This service was delivered at an urban primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Twenty patients used the BP telemonitoring service. Of these, 17 patients consented to share their views and experiences through five in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions. An interview guide was developed based on the TAM. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used for analysis. Results: Patients found the BP telemonitoring service easy to use but struggled with the perceived usefulness of doing so. They expressed confusion in making sense of the monitored home BP readings. They often thought about the implications of these readings to their hypertension management and overall health. Patients wanted more feedback from their doctors and suggested improvement to the BP telemonitoring functionalities to improve interactions. Patients cited being involved in research as the main reason for their intention to use the service. They felt that patients with limited experience with the internet and information technology, who worked out of town, or who had an outdoor hobby would not be able to benefit from such a service. Conclusion: Patients found BP telemonitoring service in primary care easy to use but needed help to interpret the meanings of monitored BP readings. Implementations of BP telemonitoring service must tackle these issues to maximize the patients' acceptance of a BP telemonitoring service.},

  abstract = {Background: The long-term risk of recurrent ischemic stroke, estimated to be between 17\% and 30\%, cannot be reliably assessed at an individual level. Our goal was to study whether machine-learning can be trained to predict stroke recurrence and identify key clinical variables and assess whether performance metrics can be optimized. Method(s): We used patient-level data from electronic health records, six interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree), four feature selection strategies, five prediction windows, and two sampling strategies to develop 288 models for up to 5-year stroke recurrence prediction. We further identified important clinical features and different optimization strategies. Result(s): We included 2091 ischemic stroke patients. Model area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was stable for prediction windows of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, with the highest score for the 1-year (0.79) and the lowest score for the 5-year prediction window (0.69). A total of 21 (7\%) models reached an AUROC above 0.73 while 110 (38\%) models reached an AUROC greater than 0.7. Among the 53 features analyzed, age, body mass index, and laboratory-based features (such as high-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin A1c, and creatinine) had the highest overall importance scores. The balance between specificity and sensitivity improved through sampling strategies. Conclusion(s): All of the selected six algorithms could be trained to predict the long-term stroke recurrence and laboratory-based variables were highly associated with stroke recurrence. The latter could be targeted for personalized interventions. Model performance metrics could be optimized, and models can be implemented in the same healthcare system as intelligent decision support for targeted intervention.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems capable of making decisions of high cognitive complexity; autonomous AI systems in healthcare are AI systems that make clinical decisions without human oversight. Such rigorously validated medical diagnostic AI systems hold great promise for improving access to care, increasing accuracy, and lowering cost, while enabling specialist physicians to provide the greatest value by managing and treating patients whose outcomes can be improved. Ensuring that autonomous AI provides these benefits requires evaluation of the autonomous AI's effect on patient outcome, design, validation, data usage, and accountability, from a bioethics and accountability perspective. We performed a literature review of bioethical principles for AI, and derived evaluation rules for autonomous AI, grounded in bioethical principles. The rules include patient outcome, validation, reference standard, design, data usage, and accountability for medical liability. Application of the rules explains successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization of an example, the first autonomous point-of-care diabetic retinopathy examination de novo authorized by the FDA, after a preregistered clinical trial. Physicians need to become competent in understanding the potential risks and benefits of autonomous AI, and understand its design, safety, efficacy and equity, validation, and liability, as well as how its data were obtained. The autonomous AI evaluation rules introduced here can help physicians understand limitations and risks as well as the potential benefits of autonomous AI for their patients.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to use an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to investigate the intention to use blockchain from the accountant's point of view. The proposed model is expected to provide the necessary incentives for accountants to adopt blockchain. The authors build external constructs based on discussions of blockchain properties for accounting such as accounting information quality, job relevance and trust. In addition, the study also considers computer self-efficacy and compatibility as factors related to practitioners' blockchain acceptance. Design/methodology/approach By using the developed online-questionnaire, the data is collected from the responses of 317 accountants working in listed enterprises in Vietnam. The main analyzes are performed by Smart partial least squares structural equation modeling technique to present both direct and indirect effects on the intention to use blockchain. Findings Experimental results provide many interesting and valuable things. First, performance and effort expectancy have a positive influence on intention to use blockchain, while social influence has a lower influence. Second, trust has a direct and positive effect on effort and performance expectancy, as well as intention to use blockchain. Quite surprisingly, accounting information quality has a positive effect on performance expectancy, while job relevance has a negative effect. Fourth, computer self-efficacy and compatibility have a positive effect on effort expectancy. It is more interesting that the intention to use blockchain has nothing to do with compatibility. The results of this study also show that performance and effort expectancy play a mediating role in the indirect effects of trust, computer self-efficacy and compatibility on intention to use blockchain. Research limitations/implications The study shows that accountants in Vietnam have a high intention to use blockchain. This implies that the Vietnamese Government and the professional association should design training programs or open training sessions on blockchain. Accountants can clearly understand the importance of blockchain in their work as well as the positive effect of blockchain on performance. They are consulted on how to use blockchain. They also perceive that using blockchain is not too difficult, and the acceptance of this technology will be higher. Additionally, universities should put triple-entry accounting into their teaching, so accounting students can improve their skills and knowledge relevant to blockchain to meet their career needs in the future. Originality/value The study proposes an extended UTAUT model with external constructs built on blockchain's effects on accounting. The model makes more sense in promoting the use of blockchain in accounting.},

  abstract = {Background: While chemotherapy is an effective method for the treatment of patients with cancer, it is a complex, multidisci-plinary, and error-prone process. Paper-based protocols are commonly applied in chemotherapy; however, they fail to eliminate the complexity of this process. Therefore, a new guideline-based workflow software (GWS) system is needed to improve the workflow and quality of chemotherapy process. Method(s): Planning was initiated 11 months before the system implementation and it involved a multidisciplinary group to analyze the current chemotherapy workflow and protocols for identifying the workflow components, analyzing paper-based protocols, de-veloping computer-based protocols, and designing of systems based on an object-oriented analysis. To implement the GWS, we applied a system based on Python programming language and SQL language. Result(s): The conceptual model was developed based on need assessments and chemotherapy steps. A minimum dataset was developed for the electronic health records. We established examination forms for the patient management system (PMS), as well as specific standard forms for chemotherapy ordering, prescription verification and administration templates. Finally, developed GWS system consisted of a PMS, computerized provider order entry (CPOE), prescription verification system (PVS), and nursing administration system (NAS). Conclusion(s): A PMS, a PVS, a NAS, and a guideline-based clinical decision support system were integrated into the CPOE system to improve the chemotherapy process. Elimination of iterations and unnecessary steps in old chemotherapy workflow, improving patient safety, improvement of communication and coordination between healthcare providers, and use of updated evidence-based medicine in direct chemotherapy orders justify the deployment of GWS in the cancer care settings.Copyright © 2021, Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the disease has gained momentum with every passing day. Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. Objective(s): This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. Method(s): A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. Result(s): Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. Conclusion(s): Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.Copyright ©Muhammad Afzal, Maqbool Hussain, Jamil Hussain, Jaehun Bang, Sungyoung Lee.},

Electric vehicles are able to store and give back energy directly to consumers and/or the grid using V2H and/or vehicle to grid (V2G) technologies. However, there is a limited understanding of what impact vehicle availability has on the its capacity to engage in such services. Using five different vehicle usage profiles, classified by the number of trips made per week, the machine learning model proposed is used to predict the availability of an EV. An optimisation model is then used on each profile to obtain the minimum electricity bill for each profile class assuming V2H service provision. PV generation providing power to the house was also considered. The ML model had an accuracy of over 85\% and R-2 value of 0.78 in predicting the location and distance travelled for the EV respectively. Final results showed that the less an EV is used for travelling, the greater its availability to participate in V2H services. Also, all categories of EV user benefited from reduced power bills when deploying V2H. An electricity cost reduction of at least 46\% on average was obtained when V2H is implemented with an agile electricity price structure regardless of the level of vehicle usage.

  abstract = {Background: Cancer diagnoses and treatments usually engender significant anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients, close relatives, and caregivers. Providing psychological support during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. As demonstrated in previous research, this evidence-based program supports good outcomes and high user satisfaction. Objective: We will implement daily supportive text messaging as a way of reducing and managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta, Canada. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care-induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated. Methods: Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and the close relatives of those dealing with a cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting "CancerCare" to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset from individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid- and endpoints of the program (ie, at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively). Data will be analyzed with parametric and nonparametric statistics for primary outcomes (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and usage metrics, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining subscriber characteristics that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program. Results: The first research stage, which was completed in April 2020, involved the creation and review of the supportive text messages and uploading of messages into a web-based text messaging service. The second stage, involving the launch of the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program, occurred in May 2020. Conclusions: Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for health care practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs. In this study, we focused on analyzing and discussing various published artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, approaches and perspectives, aiming to advance academic solutions in paving the way for a new data-centric era of discovery in healthcare.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The amount of available textual health data such as scientific and biomedical literature is constantly growing and becoming more and more challenging for health professionals to properly summarize those data and practice evidence-based clinical decision making. Moreover, the exploration of unstructured health text data is challenging for professionals without computer science knowledge due to limited time, resources, and skills. Current tools to explore text data lack ease of use, require high computational efforts, and incorporate domain knowledge and focus on topics of interest with difficulty., OBJECTIVE: We developed a methodology able to explore and target topics of interest via an interactive user interface for health professionals with limited computer science knowledge. We aim to reach near state-of-the-art performance while reducing memory consumption, increasing scalability, and minimizing user interaction effort to improve the clinical decision-making process. The performance was evaluated on diabetes-related abstracts from PubMed., METHODS: The methodology consists of 4 parts: (1) a novel interpretable hierarchical clustering of documents where each node is defined by headwords (words that best represent the documents in the node), (2) an efficient classification system to target topics, (3) minimized user interaction effort through active learning, and (4) a visual user interface. We evaluated our approach on 50,911 diabetes-related abstracts providing a hierarchical Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) structure, a unique identifier for a topic. Hierarchical clustering performance was compared against the implementation in the machine learning library scikit-learn. On a subset of 2000 randomly chosen diabetes abstracts, our active learning strategy was compared against 3 other strategies: random selection of training instances, uncertainty sampling that chooses instances about which the model is most uncertain, and an expected gradient length strategy based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs)., RESULTS: For the hierarchical clustering performance, we achieved an F1 score of 0.73 compared to 0.76 achieved by scikit-learn. Concerning active learning performance, after 200 chosen training samples based on these strategies, the weighted F1 score of all MeSH codes resulted in a satisfying 0.62 F1 score using our approach, 0.61 using the uncertainty strategy, 0.63 using the CNN, and 0.45 using the random strategy. Moreover, our methodology showed a constant low memory use with increased number of documents., CONCLUSIONS: We proposed an easy-to-use tool for health professionals with limited computer science knowledge who combine their domain knowledge with topic exploration and target specific topics of interest while improving transparency. Furthermore, our approach is memory efficient and highly parallelizable, making it interesting for large Big Data sets. This approach can be used by health professionals to gain deep insights into biomedical literature to ultimately improve the evidence-based clinical decision making process.

  abstract = {The integration of digital pathology (DP) with artificial intelligence (AI) enables faster, more accurate, and thorough diagnoses, leading to more precise personalized treatment. As technology is advancing rapidly, it is critical to understand the current state of AI applications in DP. Therefore, a patent analysis of AI in DP is required to assess the application and publication trends, major assignees, and leaders in the field. We searched five major patent databases, namely, those of the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, JPO, and CNIPA, from 1974 to 2021, using keywords such as DP, AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We discovered 6284 patents, 523 of which were used for trend analyses on time series, international distribution, top assignees; word cloud analysis; and subject category analyses. Patent filing and publication have increased exponentially over the past five years. The United States has published the most patents, followed by China and South Korea (248, 117, and 48, respectively). The top assignees were Paige.AI, Inc. (New York City, NY, USA) and Siemens, Inc. (Munich, Germany) The primary areas were whole-slide imaging, segmentation, classification, and detection. Based on these findings, we expect a surge in DP and AI patent applications focusing on the digitalization of pathological images and AI technologies that support the vital role of pathologists.},

Therefore, this research proposes to use 1 expert-driven and 7 automated feature selection schemes with well-known ML classifiers using 10 and 30 folds cross-validation. The induced results were compared with existing baselines, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Friedman test were also introduced to verify the results.

Out of twenty features, eleven features were found similar to twenty ranked features of the automated feature selection schemes subsets. The classification results of the extracted features were utmost identical to the results of twenty features subset proposed by the expert-driven feature selection scheme. Therefore, we suggest pediatricians to refresh LGA diagnosis process with the proposed scheme because of its practical usage and maximum expert involvement.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. Objective: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. Methods: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. Results: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37\% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. Conclusions: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.},

The usage of sophisticated artificial intelligence technology (AI) and the radiological images can help in diagnosing the disease reliably and addressing the problem of the shortage of trained doctors in remote villages. In this research, the automated diagnosis of Coronavirus disease was performed using a dataset of X-ray images of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia, reported COVID-19 disease, and normal cases. The goal of the study is to analyze the achievements for medical image recognition of state-of-the-art neural networking architectures. Transfer Learning technique has been implemented in this work. Transfer learning is an ambitious task, but it results in impressive outcomes for identifying distinct patterns in tiny datasets of medical images. The findings indicate that deep learning with X-ray imagery could retrieve important biomarkers relevant for COVID-19 disease detection. Since all diagnostic measures show failure levels that pose questions, the scientific profession should determine the probability of integration of X-rays with the clinical treatment, utilizing the results. The proposed model achieved 96.73\% accuracy outperforming the ResNet50 and traditional Resnet18 models. Based on our findings, the proposed system can help the specialist doctors in making verdicts for COVID-19 detection.},

  abstract = {In the petroleum refining industries, the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is one of the most common techniques for purifying petroleum products from undesirable sulfur species to reduce SO2 emission. However, HDS is still complicated as many aspects dominate the rate of sulfur removal such as operating conditions, feed formulations, catalyst activity, etc. In reality, the reduction of sulfur compounds has expensive costs either environmentally or economically. In practical usage, there is a need to predict the process yields and their consequences related to productivity, profitability, and environmental factors. The study of such consequences may serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners. Artificial Intelligence algorithms have proven to be effective in solving various real-world problems in engineering and industrial fields, including the petroleum industry. In this paper, a hybrid-ML approach (SVMG) incorporates both support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) to build models for HDS yields prediction. The created SVMG models are used to identify the best laboratory configuration for better optimization of the process. The optimization problem can be stated as minimization of sulfur concentration, percentage of SO2 emission, and HDS cost. The obtained modeling results reveal that the developed SVMG models are competent with a high degree of accuracy as indicated by correlation coefficients of 99.4\%, 99.0\%, and 98.7\% during the testing of the models. In addition, the results of the experimental validation showed that there is an agreement between the expected values obtained from the proposed models and experimental values that were conducted in the laboratory with an average experimental error of less than 4\%.},

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate the most effective and interesting variables that urge use of the smartwatch (SW) in a medical environment. To achieve this aim, the study was framed using an innovative and integrated research model, which is based on combining constructs from a well-established theoretical model's TAM and other features that are critical to the effectiveness of SW which are content richness and personal innovativeness. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is used to detect the determinants affecting the adoption of SW. The current study depends on an online questionnaire that is composed of (20) items. The questionnaire is distributed among a group of doctors, nurses, and administration staff in medical centers within the UAE. The total number of respondents is (325). The collected data were implemented to test the study model and the proposed constructs and hypotheses depending on the Smart PLS Software. The results of the current study show that the main constructs in the model contribute differently to the acceptance of SW. Based on the previous assumption, content richness and innovativeness are critical factors that enrich the user's perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease of use was significantly predictive of either perceived usefulness or behavioral intention. Overall findings suggest that SW is in high demand in the medical field and is used as a common channel among doctors and their patients and it facilitates the role of transmitting information among its users. The outcomes of the current study indicate the importance of certain external factors for the acceptance of the technology. The genuine value of this study lies in the fact that it is based on a conceptual framework that emphasizes the close relationship between the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to the construct of content richness, and innovativeness. Finally, this study helps us recognize the embedded motives for using SW in a medical environment, where the main motive is to enhance and facilitate the effective roles of doctors and patients.},

According to the United Nation's report, COVID-19 has influenced more than 1.6 billion learners from all over the world (190 countries or more). To tackle this problem, universities and colleges have implemented various technologically based platforms to replace the physical classrooms during the spread of Coronavirus. The effectiveness of these technologies and their educational impact on the educational sector has been the concern of researchers during the spread of the pandemic. Consequently, the current study is an attempt to explore the effect of Google Meet acceptance among Arab students during the pandemic in Oman, UAE, and Jordan. The perceived fear factor is integrated into a hybrid model that combines crucial factors in TAM (Technology acceptance Model) and VAM (Value-based Adoption Model). The integration embraces perceived fear factor with other important factors in TAM perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) on the one hand and technically influential factor of VAM, which are perceived technicality (PTE) and perceived enjoyment (PE) on the other hand. The data, collected from 475 participants (49\% males and 51\% females students), were analyzed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results have shown that TAM hypotheses of usefulness and easy to use have been supported. Similarly, the results have supported the hypotheses related to VAM factors of being technically useful and enjoying, which helps in reducing the atmosphere of fear that is created due to the spread of Coronavirus.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have received considerable attention during the last few years. However, little is known concerning what affects their use for educational purposes. This research, therefore, develops a theoretical model based on extracting constructs from the expectation confirmation model (ECM) (expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction), combined with the knowledge management (KM) factors (knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge application) to understand the sustainable use of chatbots. The developed model was then tested based on data collected through an online survey from 448 university students who used chatbots for learning purposes. Contrary to the prior literature that mainly relied on structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, the empirical data were analyzed using a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. The hypotheses testing results reinforced all the suggested hypotheses in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that knowledge application has the most considerable effect on the sustainable use of chatbots with 96.9\% normalized importance, followed by perceived usefulness (70.7\%), knowledge acquisition (69.3\%), satisfaction (61\%), and knowledge sharing (19.6\%). Deriving from these results, the study highlighted a number of practical implications that benefit developers, designers, service providers, and instructors.},

To our knowledge, no published report or protocol synthesizes the full breadth of stakeholder perspectives. The absence of such a rigorous foundation perpetuates the "AI chasm," which continues to delay patient benefit. Objective: The aim of this research is to synthesize stakeholder perspectives of computerized clinical decision support tools in any health care setting. Synthesized findings will inform future research and the implementation of AI into health care services. Methods: The search strategy will use MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO), ACM Digital Library, and Science Citation Index (Web of Science). Following deduplication, title, abstract, and full text screening will be performed by 2 independent reviewers with a third topic expert arbitrating. The quality of included studies will be appraised to support interpretation. Best-fit framework synthesis will be performed, with line-by-line coding completed by 2 independent reviewers. Where appropriate, these findings will be assigned to 1 of 22 a priori themes defined by the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework. New domains will be inductively generated for outlying findings. The placement of findings within themes will be reviewed iteratively by a study advisory group including patient and lay representatives. Results: Study registration was obtained from PROSPERO (CRD42021256005) in May 2021. Final searches were executed in April, and screening is ongoing at the time of writing. Full text data analysis is due to be completed in October 2021. We anticipate that the study will be submitted for open-access publication in late 2021. Conclusions: This paper describes the protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis aiming to define barriers and facilitators to the implementation of computerized clinical decision support tools from all relevant stakeholders. The results of this study are intended to expedite the delivery of patient benefit from AI-enabled clinical tools.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning models have been reported to assist in the proper management of cancer through accurate prognostication. Integrating such models as a web-based prognostic tool or calculator may help to improve cancer care and assist clinicians in making oral cancer management-related decisions. However, none of these models have been recommended in daily practices of oral cancer due to concerns related to machine learning methodologies and clinical implementation challenges. An instance of the concerns inherent to the science of machine learning is explainability. Objectives: This study measures the usability and explainability of a machine learning-based web prognostic tool that was designed for prediction of oral tongue cancer. We used the System Usability Scale (SUS) and System Causability Scale (SCS) to evaluate the explainability of the prognostic tool. In addition, we propose a framework for the evaluation of post hoc explainability of web-based prognostic tools. Methods: A SUS- and SCS-based questionnaire was administered amongst pathologists, radiologists, cancer and machine learning researchers and surgeons (n = 11) to evaluate the quality of explanations offered by the machine learning-based web prognostic tool to address the concern of explainability and usability of these models for cancer management. The examined web-based tool was developed by our group and is freely available online. Results: In terms of the usability of the web-based tool using the SUS, 81.9\% (45.5\% strongly agreed; 36.4\% agreed) agreed that neither the support of a technical assistant nor a need to learn many things were required to use the web-based tool. Furthermore, 81.8\% agreed that the evaluated web-based tool was not cumbersome to use (usability). The average score for the SCS (explainability) was 0.74. A total of 91.0\% of the participants strongly agreed that the web-based tool can assist in clinical decision-making. These scores indicated that the examined web-based tool offers a significant level of usability and explanations about the outcome of interest. Conclusions: Integrating the trained and internally and externally validated model as a web-based tool or calculator is poised to offer an effective and easy approach towards the usage and acceptance of these models in the future daily practice. This approach has received significant attention in recent years. Thus, it is important that the usability and explainability of these models are measured to achieve such touted benefits. A usable and well-explained web-based tool further brings the use of these web-based tools closer to everyday clinical practices. Thus, the concept of more personalized and precision oncology can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Background: In 2016, 44,965 people in the United States died by suicide. It is common to see people with suicidal ideation seek help or leave suicide notes on social media before attempting suicide. Many prefer to express their feelings with longer passages on forums such as Reddit and blogs. Because these expressive posts follow regular language patterns, potential suicide attempts can be prevented by detecting suicidal posts as they are written. Objective: This study aims to build a classifier that differentiates suicidal and nonsuicidal forum posts via text mining methods applied on post titles and bodies. Methods: A total of 508,398 Reddit posts longer than 100 characters and posted between 2008 and 2016 on SuicideWatch, Depression, Anxiety, and ShowerThoughts subreddits were downloaded from the publicly available Reddit dataset. Of these, 10,785 posts were randomly selected and 785 were manually annotated as suicidal or nonsuicidal. Features were extracted using term frequency-inverse document frequency, linguistic inquiry and word count, and sentiment analysis on post titles and bodies. Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were applied on resulting corpus and prediction performance is evaluated. Results: The logistic regression and SVM classifiers correctly identified suicidality of posts with 80\% to 92\% accuracy and F1 score, respectively, depending on different data compositions closely followed by random forest, compared to baseline ZeroR algorithm achieving 50\% accuracy and 66\% F1 score. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it is possible to detect people with suicidal ideation on online forums with high accuracy. The logistic regression classifier in this study can potentially be embedded on blogs and forums to make the decision to offer real-time online counseling in case a suicidal post is being written.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and its applications in healthcare have gained a lot of attention. When enhanced computational power is combined with big data, there is an opportunity to use ML algorithms to improve health care. Supervised learning is the type of ML that can be implemented to predict labeled data based on algorithms such as linear or logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, LASSO regression, K Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes classifier. Unsupervised ML models can identify data patterns in datasets that do not contain information about the outcome. Such models can be used for fraud or anomaly detection. Examples of clinical applications of ML include the formulation of various clinical decision support systems. An important public health application of ML is the identification and prediction of populations at high risk for developing certain adverse health outcomes and the development of public health interventions targeted to these populations. Various concepts related to ML need to be integrated into the medical curriculum so that health professionals can effectively guide and interpret research in this area.Copyright © 2022},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endovascular thrombectomy (ET) is the standard of care for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to large vessel occlusion. The elderly population has been under-represented in clinical trials on ET, and recent studies have reported higher morbidity and mortality in elderly patients than in their younger counterparts., OBJECTIVE: To use machine learning algorithms to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to select elderly patients for ET., METHODS: We used a retrospectively identified cohort of 110 patients undergoing ET for AIS at our institution to train a regression tree model that can predict 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. The identified algorithm, termed SPOT, was compared with other decision trees and regression models, and then validated using a prospective cohort of 36 patients., RESULTS: When predicting rates of functional independence at 90 days, SPOT showed a sensitivity of 89.36\% and a specificity of 89.66\% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. Performance of SPOT was significantly better than results obtained using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, or patients' baseline deficits. The negative predictive value for SPOT was {$>$}95\%, and in patients who were SPOT-negative, we observed higher rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombectomy. With mRS scores prediction, the mean absolute error for SPOT was 0.82., CONCLUSIONS: SPOT is designed to aid clinical decision of whether to undergo ET in elderly patients. Our data show that SPOT is a useful tool to determine which patients to exclude from ET, and has been implemented in an online calculator for public use.

  abstract = {Background: Carbohydrate counting is an important component of diabetes management, but it is challenging, often performed inaccurately, and can be a barrier to optimal diabetes management. iSpy is a novel mobile app that leverages machine learning to allow food identification through images and that was designed to assist youth with type 1 diabetes in counting carbohydrates. Objective: Our objective was to test the app's usability and potential impact on carbohydrate counting accuracy. Methods: Iterative usability testing (3 cycles) was conducted involving a total of 16 individuals aged 8.5-17.0 years with type 1 diabetes. Participants were provided a mobile device and asked to complete tasks using iSpy app features while thinking aloud. Errors were noted, acceptability was assessed, and refinement and retesting were performed across cycles. Subsequently, iSpy was evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial with 22 iSpy users and 22 usual care controls aged 10-17 years. Primary outcome was change in carbohydrate counting ability over 3 months. Secondary outcomes included levels of engagement and acceptability. Change in HbA(1c) level was also assessed. Results: Use of iSpy was associated with improved carbohydrate counting accuracy (total grams per meal, P=.008), reduced frequency of individual counting errors greater than 10 g (P=.047), and lower HbA(1c) levels (P=.03). Qualitative interviews and acceptability scale scores were positive. No major technical challenges were identified. Moreover, 43\% (9/21) of iSpy participants were still engaged, with usage at least once every 2 weeks, at the end of the study. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of efficacy and high acceptability of a novel carbohydrate counting app, supporting the advancement of digital health apps for diabetes care among youth with type 1 diabetes. Further testing is needed, but iSpy may be a useful adjunct to traditional diabetes management.},

Using survey data from 442 SANAD App from Jordan, the model was empirically validated using AMOS 20 confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) and machine learning (ML) methods were performed to assess the study hypotheses. The ML methods used are ANN, SMO, the bagging reduced error pruning tree (RepTree), and random forest. The results suggested several key findings: the respondents' performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, trust, and perceived service quality of this digital technology were significant antecedents for their attitude to using it. The strength of these relationships is affected by the moderating variables, including age, gender, educational level, and internet experience on behavioral intention. Yet, perceived risk did not have a significant effect on attitude towards SANAD App The study adds to literature by empirically testing and theorizing the effects of SANAD App on public health protection.},

All the current existing models are designed for either Hi-C or capture Hi-C data, however we developed MaxHiC to be applicable for both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries (two different models have been used for Hi-C and capture Hi-C data). MaxHiC is also able to analyse very deep Hi-C libraries (e.g., Micro-C) without any computational issues. MaxHiC significantly outperforms current existing Hi-C significant interaction callers and even Hi-C loop callers in terms of enrichment of interactions between known regulatory regions as well as biologically relevant interactions. Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data.},

Design/Methodology/Approach: A survey was conducted on 4 large and non-large companies in Jordan, and data were retrieved from 168 external auditors. The partial least squares (PLS-3) structural equations modeling was used to analyse data and to test the proposed model. Research findings: Results show that the TOE factors have a significant and positive effect on digital technologies utilisation. It also appears to enhance auditors' performance. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study fills a gap in the literature of accounting by empirically assessing how digital technologies utilisation impacts the performance of auditors in Jordan. It also expands on previous literature by determining how the TOE factors affect such technology usage in the auditing process. This study also has a methodological contribution in the form of measuring the client's complexity of IT system from a different perspective, which is from the external auditor's perspective. Practitioner/Policy implications: This study is expected to help regulators and audit companies to update their policies and regulations so that auditors are trained in using advanced technologies, and in protecting the security of accounting information. In this regard, efficient auditors will be able to protect investors, thereby creating an attractive environment for investment which can boost economic growth. Research limitation/Implications: This study is based on the Jordanian context. There was no comparison made with developing or developed countries, hence no distinctions can be detected. Future studies should focus on looking at other countries so as to provide new insights into the auditing profession, and specifically, auditors' performance. Finally, this study is a practical guide for external and internal auditors who have not considered digital technologies, in the context of Jordan. Future studies may thus consider internal auditors and their relationship with external auditors in digital technologies utilisation.},

In particular, CHAT provides researchers a theoretical lens to account for context and activity mediation and, by doing so, can increase the significance of information behavior research to practice. In undertaking this endeavour, we have relied on literature from the fields of information science and others where CHAT is employed. We provide a detailed description of how CHAT may be applied to information behavior and account for the concepts we see as relevant to its study.},

Although increased screening frequency can avoid delayed diagnoses, this is not uniformly implemented. The purpose of this study was to develop and retrospectively validate a machine learning algorithm (MLA) that predicts stages of DKD within 5 years upon diagnosis of T2DM. Research design and methods Two MLAs were trained to predict stages of DKD severity, and compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) risk score to evaluate performance. The models were validated on a hold-out test set as well as an external dataset sourced from separate facilities. Results The MLAs outperformed the CDC risk score in both the hold-out test and external datasets. Our algorithms achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.75 on the hold-out set for prediction of any-stage DKD and an AUROC of over 0.82 for more severe endpoints, compared with the CDC risk score with an AUROC {$<$}0.70 on all test sets and endpoints. Conclusion This retrospective study shows that an MLA can provide timely predictions of DKD among patients with recently diagnosed T2DM.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The present study aims to evaluate students' perception of the application of MS in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for medical-educational purposes. In this study, 1858 university students were surveyed to examine this model. The study's conceptual framework consisted of adoption constructs including Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Personal innovativeness (PI), Perceived Compatibility (PCO), User Satisfaction (US), Perceived Triability (PTR), and Perceived Observability (POB). The study was unique because the model correlated technology-based features and individual-based features.

The present study also employs the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to assess the importance and performance factors. The study finds US as an essential determinant of users' intention to use the metaverse (UMS). The present study's finding is useful for stakeholders in the educational sector in understanding the importance of each factor and in making plans based on the order of significance of each factor.

When ICP is monitored with an external ventricular drain, the pressure recorded by the monitor does not always correspond to the real ICP, depending on the status (open/closed) of the 3-way tap. Misleading values could therefore be sent to the patient medical record. Our hypothesis is that a machine-learning algorithm will be able to identify automatically and in real time the reliable and non-reliable values of the ICP signal. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively studied pediatric patients having an external ventricular drain between July 2018 and July 2019, in a single pediatric intensive care unit. The ICP signals were extracted from a high-frequency database (128 Hz) and pre-processed adequately. To train the algorithms, an annotated database was manually created with two classes: reliable ICP vs. non-reliable ICP (drain system opened to allow cerebrospinal fuid removal). Eleven signal characteristics were compared between the two classes (Mann-Whitney test), and signifcantly differing variables were tested in the algorithms. We compared the performance of two machine-learning algorithms: the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using 10-fold cross-validation method, 75\% of the data was used to train the algorithms and 25\% was used for testing. The best classifer was further validated by simulating a real-time ICP analysis, using a 15 s sliding-window approach with 50\% overlap. The study was approved by the localresearch ethics committee. Result(s): Sixteen patients were included in the study. The training database created from 14 patients, contained 320 segments (of 15 s duration) per class and per patient. Eight signal variables were identifed and kept to defne the segments. The KNN algorithm, with k = 3, led to the best performance, with a mean of 98\% (mean +/- SD: 98\% +/- 0.29\%). The KNN was then visually validated on ICP signals from the remaining two patients (Figure). By simulating a real-time ICP extraction, our algorithm was able to effciently identify the reliable ICP segments, and to display a mean value only for valid segments. Conclusion(s): The proposed machine learning algorithm can help identifying the validity of ICP values recorded using a ventricular drain in real time. After external validation, this algorithm could be implemented in future clinical decision support system to optimize the care of TBI patients.},

  abstract = {The presented paper aims to establish a strong basis for utilizing machine learning (ML) towards the prediction of the overall insulation health condition of medium voltage distribution transformers based on their oil test results. To validate the presented approach, the ML algorithms were tested on two databases of more than 1000 medium voltage transformer oil samples of ratings in the order of tens of MVA. The oil test results were acquired from in-service transformers (during oil sampling time) of two different utility companies in the gulf region. The illustrated procedure aimed to mimic a realistic scenario of how the utility would benefit from the use of different ML tools towards understanding the insulation health index of their transformers. This objective was achieved using two procedural steps. In the first step, three different data training and testing scenarios were used with several pattern recognition tools for classifying the transformer health condition based on the full set of input test features. In the second step, the same pattern recognition tools were used along with the three training/testing scenarios for a reduced number of test features. Also, a previously developed reduced model was the basis to reduce the needed number of tests for transformer health index calculations. It was found that reducing the number of tests did not influence the accuracy of the ML prediction models, which is considered as a significant advantage in terms of transformer asset management (TAM) cost reduction.},

The ongoing development of intelligent systems aims to provide better reasoning and to more efficiently use the data collected. This use is not restricted retrospective interpretation, that is, to provide diagnostic conclusions. It can also be extended to prospective interpretation providing early prognosis. That said, physicians who could be assisted by these systems find themselves standing in the gap between clinical case and deep technical reviews. What they lack is a clear starting point from which to approach the world of machine learning in medicine. Methodology and Main Structure: This article aims at providing interested physicians with an easy-to-follow insight of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) use in the medical field, primarily over the last few years. To this end, we first discuss the general developmental paths concerning AI and ML concept usage in healthcare systems. We then list fields where these technologies are already being put to the test or even applied such as in Hematology, Neurology, Cardiology, Oncology, Radiology, Ophthalmology, Cell Biology and Cell Therapy.

  abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are one of the most common frameworks for knowledge representation. However, they suffer from a severe scalability problem that hinders their usage. KG embedding aims to provide a solution to this issue. Nonetheless, general approaches are incapable of representing and reasoning about information not previously contained in the graph. This paper proposes to leverage semantic and ontological information for a significant benefit of knowledge graph completion, focusing on triple classification. The goal of this task is to determine whether a given fact holds. Furthermore, this paper also considers the classification of facts that include entities that have not been seen during training, denoted out-of-knowledge-base or OOKB entities. An incremental method is presented, composed of six stages. Although the proposal can be applied to any KG embedding model, this work focuses on its application for semantic matching models, such as ComplEx and DistMult. Compared to other approaches, our proposal is model-agnostic, computationally inexpensive, and does not require retraining. The results show that triple classification accuracy scales up to 15\% with the proposed approach, as well as accelerating the convergence of the model to its optimal solution. Furthermore, facts containing OOKB entities can be classified with a reasonable accuracy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Adults aged 60 and over are most vulnerable to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Nevertheless, the extent to which chronological age (CA) at injury affects TBI-related brain aging is unknown. This study applies Gaussian process regression to T-1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) acquired within similar to 7 days and again similar to 6 months after a single mTBI sustained by 133 participants aged 20-83 (CA mu +/- sigma = 42.6 +/- 17 years; 51 females). Brain BAs are estimated, modeled, and compared as a function of sex and CA at injury using a statistical model selection procedure. On average, the brains of older adults age by 15.3 +/- 6.9 years after mTBI, whereas those of younger adults age only by 1.8 +/- 5.6 years, a significant difference (Welch's t(32) = - 9.17, p similar or equal to 9.47 x 10(-11)). For an adult aged similar to 30 to similar to 60, the expected amount of TBI-related brain aging is similar to 3 years greater than in an individual younger by a decade. For an individual over similar to 60, the respective amount is similar to 7 years. Despite no significant sex differences in brain aging (Welch's t(108) =0.78, p{$>$} 0.78), the statistical test is underpowered. BAs estimated at acute baseline versus chronic followup do not differ significantly (t(264)=0.41, p{$>$} 0.66, power =80\%), suggesting negligible TBI-related brain aging during the chronic stage of TBI despite accelerated aging during the acute stage. Our results indicate that a single mTBI sustained after age similar to 60 involves approximately similar to 10 years of premature and lasting brain aging, which is MRI detectable as early as similar to 7 days post-injury.},

This paper proposes a novel model for Dengue disease detection based on social media posts alone. The model does not access any personal information of people or any medical record. The model extracts the presence of patients infected with Dengue disease based on tweets only and decides whether it is a general discussion about the disease, and no one is actually infected, or people are actually infected with that disease. The identification of people infected with Dengue is determined by clinical tests, but the propose technique is used for automatic surveillance and identification of regions where the spread is happening at an alarming rate and guide healthcare professional to take necessary actions to control the spread. This paper uses different machine/deep learning approaches to utilize tweets data for automatic and efficient disease detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to achieve 92\% accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art techniques in this domain.},

  abstract = {Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in thelate 2019 has caused a devastating global pandemic of the severe pneumonia-like disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although vaccines have been and are being developed, they are not accessible to everyone and not everyone can receive these vaccines. Also, it typically takes more than 10 years until a new therapeutic agent is approved for usage. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs can lend itself well as a key approach for significantly expediting the development of new therapies for COVID-19. Methods We have incorporated machine learning-based computational tools and in silico models into the drug discovery process to predict Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) profiles of 90 potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment identified from two independent studies mainly with the purpose of mitigating late-phase failures because of inferior pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Results Here, we summarize the cardiotoxicity and general toxicity profiles of 90 potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment and outline the risks of repurposing and propose a stratification of patients accordingly. We shortlist a total of five compounds based on their non-toxic properties. Conclusion In summary, this manuscript aims to provide a potentially useful source of essential knowledge on toxicity assessment of 90 compounds for healthcare practitioners and researchers to find off-label alternatives for the treatment for COVID-19. The majority of the molecules discussed in this manuscript have already moved into clinical trials and thus their known pharmacological and human safety profiles are expected to facilitate a fast track preclinical and clinical assessment for treating COVID-19.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric guidelines based care is often overlooked because of the constraints of a typical office visit and the sheer number of guidelines that may exist for a patient's visit. In response to this problem, in 2004 we developed a pediatric computer based clinical decision support system using Arden Syntax medical logic modules (MLM)., METHODS: The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation system (CHICA) screens patient families in the waiting room and alerts the physician in the exam room. Here we describe adaptation of Arden Syntax to support production and consumption of patient specific tailored documents for every clinical encounter in CHICA and describe the experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of this system., RESULTS: As of this writing CHICA has served over 44,000 patients at 7 pediatric clinics in our healthcare system in the last decade and its MLMs have been fired 6182,700 times in "produce" and 5334,021 times in "consume" mode. It has run continuously for over 10 years and has been used by 755 physicians, residents, fellows, nurse practitioners, nurses and clinical staff. There are 429 MLMs implemented in CHICA, using the Arden Syntax standard. Studies of CHICA's effectiveness include several published randomized controlled trials., CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the Arden Syntax standard provided us with an effective way to represent pediatric guidelines for use in routine care. We only required minor modifications to the standard to support our clinical workflow. Additionally, Arden Syntax implementation in CHICA facilitated the study of many pediatric guidelines in real clinical environments. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background               Musculoskeletal symptoms such as neck and shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain are common health problems in the working population. They are the leading causes of presenteeism (employees being physically present at work but unable to be fully engaged). Recently, digital interventions have begun to be used to manage health but their effectiveness has not yet been fully verified, and adherence to such programs is always a problem.                                         Objective               This study aimed to evaluate the improvements in musculoskeletal symptoms in workers with neck/shoulder stiffness/pain and low back pain after the use of an exercise-based artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted interactive health promotion system that operates through a mobile messaging app (the AI-assisted health program). We expected that this program would support participants’ adherence to exercises.                                         Methods               We conducted a two-armed, randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial in workers with either neck/shoulder stiffness/pain or low back pain or both. We recruited participants with these symptoms through email notifications. The intervention group received the AI-assisted health program, in which the chatbot sent messages to users with the exercise instructions at a fixed time every day through the smartphone’s chatting app (LINE) for 12 weeks. The program was fully automated. The control group continued with their usual care routines. We assessed the subjective severity of the neck and shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain of the participants by using a scoring scale of 1 to 5 for both the intervention group and the control group at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention by using a web-based form. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) of the intervention group to achieve to reduce pain scores with those of the control group, and the ORs of the subjective assessment of the improvement of the symptoms compared to the intervention and control groups, which were performed using Stata software (version 16, StataCorp LLC).                                         Results               We analyzed 48 participants in the intervention group and 46 participants in the control group. The adherence rate was 92\% (44/48) during the intervention. The participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in the severity of the neck/shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain compared to those in the control group (OR 6.36, 95\% CI 2.57-15.73; P{$<$}.001). Based on the subjective assessment of the improvement of the pain/stiffness at 12 weeks, 36 (75\%) out of 48 participants in the intervention group and 3 (7\%) out of 46 participants in the control group showed improvements (improved, slightly improved) (OR 43.00, 95\% CI 11.25-164.28; P{$<$}.001).                                         Conclusions               This study shows that the short exercises provided by the AI-assisted health program improved both neck/shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain in 12 weeks. Further studies are needed to identify the elements contributing to the successful outcome of the AI-assisted health program.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine-learning methods such as the Bayesian belief network, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision trees have been used to develop decision-support tools in other clinical settings. Opioid abuse is a problem among civilians and military service members, and it is difficult to anticipate which patients are at risk for prolonged opioid use., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) To build a cross-validated model that predicts risk of prolonged opioid use after a specific orthopaedic procedure (ACL reconstruction), (2) To describe the relationships between prognostic and outcome variables, and (3) To determine the clinical utility of a predictive model using a decision curve analysis (as measured by our predictive system's ability to effectively identify high-risk patients and allow for preventative measures to be taken to ensure a successful procedure process)., METHODS: We used the Military Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2) to search the Military Health System Data Repository for all patients undergoing arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction (Current Procedure Terminology code 29888) from January 2012 through December 2015 with a minimum of 90 days postoperative follow-up. In total, 10,919 patients met the inclusion criteria, most of whom were young men on active duty. We obtained complete opioid prescription filling histories from the Military Health System Data Repository's pharmacy records. We extracted data including patient demographics, military characteristics, and pharmacy data. A total of 3.3\% of the data was missing. To curate and impute all missing variables, we used a random forest algorithm. We shuffled and split the data into 80\% training and 20\% hold-out sets, balanced by outcome variable (Outcome90Days). Next, the training set was further split into training and validation sets. Each model was built on the training data set, tuned with the validation set as applicable, and finally tested on the separate hold-out dataset. We chose four predictive models to develop, at the end choosing the best-fit model for implementation. Logistic regression, random forest, Bayesian belief network, and gradient boosting machine models were the four chosen models based on type of analysis (classification). Each were trained to estimate the likelihood of prolonged opioid use, defined as any opioid prescription filled more than 90 days after anterior cruciate reconstruction. After this, we tested the models on our holdout set and performed an area under the curve analysis concordance statistic, calculated the Brier score, and performed a decision curve analysis for validation. Then, we chose the method that produced the most suitable analysis results and, consequently, predictive power across the three calculations. Based on the calculations, the gradient boosting machine model was selected for future implementation. We systematically selected features and tuned the gradient boosting machine to produce a working predictive model. We performed area under the curve, Brier, and decision curve analysis calculations for the final model to test its viability and gain an understanding of whether it is possible to predict prolonged opioid use., RESULTS: Four predictive models were successfully developed using gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, Bayesian belief network, and random forest methods. After applying the Boruta algorithm for feature selection based on a 100-tree random forest algorithm, features were narrowed to a final seven features. The most influential features with a positive association with prolonged opioid use are preoperative morphine equivalents (yes), particular pharmacy ordering sites locations, shorter deployment time, and younger age. Those observed to have a negative association with prolonged opioid use are particular pharmacy ordering sites locations, preoperative morphine equivalents (no), longer deployment, race (American Indian or Alaskan native) and rank (junior enlisted). On internal validation, the models showed accuracy for predicting prolonged opioid use with AUC greater than our benchmark cutoff 0.70; random forest were 0.76 (95\% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.79), 0.76 (95\% CI 0.73 to 0.78), 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71 to 0.76), and 0.72 (95\% CI 0.69 to 0.75), respectively. Although the results from logistic regression and gradient boosting machines were very similar, only one model can be used in implementation. Based on our calculation of the Brier score, area under the curve, and decision curve analysis, we chose the gradient boosting machine as the final model. After selecting features and tuning the chosen gradient boosting machine, we saw an incremental improvement in our implementation model; the final model is accurate, with a Brier score of 0.10 (95\% CI 0.09 to 0.11) and area under the curve of 0.77 (95\% CI 0.75 to 0.80). It also shows the best clinical utility in a decision curve analysis., CONCLUSIONS: These scores support our claim that it is possible to predict which patients are at risk of prolonged opioid use, as seen by the appropriate range of hold-out analysis calculations. Current opioid guidelines recommend preoperative identification of at-risk patients, but available tools for this purpose are crude, largely focusing on identifying the presence (but not relative contributions) of various risk factors and screening for depression. The power of this model is that it will permit the development of a true clinical decision-support tool, which risk-stratifies individual patients with a single numerical score that is easily understandable to both patient and surgeon. Probabilistic models provide insight into how clinical factors are conditionally related. Not only will this gradient boosting machine be used to help understand factors contributing to opiate misuse after ACL reconstruction, but also it will allow orthopaedic surgeons to identify at-risk patients before surgery and offer increased support and monitoring to prevent opioid abuse and dependency., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.},

Despite negative effects on mothers’ and children’s health, many women do not receive adequate care. Preventive interventions are cost-efficient among high-risk women, but our ability to identify these is poor. We leveraged the power of clinical, demographic, and psychometric data to assess if machine learning methods can make accurate predictions of postpartum depression. Data were obtained from a population-based prospective cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden, collected between 2009 and 2018 (BASIC study, n\,=\,4313). Sub-analyses among women without previous depression were performed. The extremely randomized trees method provided robust performance with highest accuracy and well-balanced sensitivity and specificity (accuracy 73\%, sensitivity 72\%, specificity 75\%, positive predictive value 33\%, negative predictive value 94\%, area under the curve 81\%). Among women without earlier mental health issues, the accuracy was 64\%. The variables setting women at most risk for PPD were depression and anxiety during pregnancy, as well as variables related to resilience and personality. Future clinical models that could be implemented directly after delivery might consider including these variables in order to identify women at high risk for postpartum depression to facilitate individualized follow-up and cost-effectiveness.},

The objective of this method is to estimate the amount of accumulated frost on the surface of the evaporator inside a domestic refrigerator. This methodology generates a set of acoustic signals with different frequency values. These signals interact inside the evaporator cavity. Each additional signal is absorbed and reflected depending on the amount of accumulated frost. This method uses an intelligent model and a combination of an active speaker and a simple microphone to estimate the accumulation of frost on the evaporator surface. Additionally, is proposed the use of sound pressure levels to reduce the data dimensionality. These sound pressure level values create the training and the validation dataset. In this work, is proposed the use of two intelligent models to analyze the datasets. These models are based on artificial neural networks and probabilistic neural networks. Several tests were performed in a domestic refrigerator following the typical usage habits to collect the data. Each test ran for 24 h to measure sound pressure levels at different frequencies and periods. The main contribution of this work is a low-cost method to estimate the amount of frost accumulated in the evaporator surface. One of the main advantages of the proposed method is that it can be easily incorporated into a domestic refrigerator. The results indicate that this method is capable of estimating with accuracy four different levels of frost accumulation on the evaporator surface of a domestic refrigerator.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The increasing availability of healthcare data and rapid development of big data analytic methods has opened new avenues for use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)- and Machine Learning (ML)-based technology in medical practice. However, applications at the point of care are still scarce. Objective(s): Review and discuss case studies to understand current capabilities for applying AI/ML in the healthcare setting, and regulatory requirements in the US, Europe and China. Method(s): A targeted narrative literature review of AI/ML based digital tools was performed. Scientific publications (identified in PubMed) and grey literature (identified on the websites of regulatory agencies) were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): From the regulatory perspective, AI/ML-based solutions can be considered medical devices (i.e., Software as Medical Device, SaMD). A case series of SaMD is presented. First, tools for monitoring and remote management of chronic diseases are presented. Second, imaging applications for diagnostic support are discussed. Finally, clinical decision support tools to facilitate the choice of treatment and precision dosing are reviewed. While tested and validated algorithms for precision dosing exist, their implementation at the point of care is limited, and their regulatory and commercialization pathway is not clear. Regulatory requirements depend on the level of risk associated with the use of the device in medical practice, and can be classified into administrative (manufacturing and quality control), software-related (design, specification, hazard analysis, architecture, traceability, software risk analysis, cybersecurity, etc.), clinical evidence (including patient perspectives in some cases), non-clinical evidence (dosing validation and biocompatibility/toxicology) and other, such as e.g. benefit-to-risk determination, risk assessment and mitigation. There generally is an alignment between the US and Europe. China additionally requires that the clinical evidence is applicable to the Chinese population and recommends that a third-party central laboratory evaluates the clinical trial results. Conclusion(s): The number of promising AI/ML-based technologies is increasing, but few have been implemented widely at the point of care. The need for external validation, implementation logistics, and data exchange and privacy remain the main obstacles.© Copyright © 2020 Angehrn, Haldna, Zandvliet, Gil Berglund, Zeeuw, Amzal, Cheung, Polasek, Pfister, Kerbusch and Heckman.},

They allow users to electronically write the full range of orders, maintain an online medication administration record, and review changes made to an order by successive personnel. They also offer safety alerts that are triggered when an unsafe order (such as for a duplicate drug therapy) is entered, as well as clinical decision support to guide caregivers to less expensive alternatives or to choices that better fit established hospital protocols. CPOE systems can, when correctly configured, markedly increase efficiency and improve patient safety and patient care. However, facilities need to recognize that currently available CPOE systems require a tremendous amount of time and effort to be spent in customization before their safety and clinical support features can be effectively implemented. What's more, even after they've been customized, the systems may still allow certain unsafe orders to be entered. Thus, CPOE systems are not currently a quick or easy remedy for medical errors. ECRI's Evaluation of CPOE systems--conducted in collaboration with the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)--discusses these and other related issues. It also examines and compares CPOE systems from three suppliers: Eclipsys Corp., IDX Systems Corp., and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corp. Our testing focuses primarily on the systems' interfacing capabilities, patient safeguards, and ease of use.},

The data sources are still largely provided by physical sensors and technical devices, albeit a significant role is already played (e.g. in environmental monitoring networks) by virtual or soft sensors provided by simulation models, while a growing role is being played by human data generated thru participatory platforms and specifically social networks. This wider framework provides new challenges to "fuse" data from diverse data streams into coherent information and to design novel applications, to support the management of urban infrastructures. Statistical learning and, more recently, network science play a critical role in the design of the representation models and computational engines needed to turn the data resources into actionable knowledge. This paper draws upon the design experience gained from several EU projects and proposes a software architecture based on a network of services. Key issues are: how people use the city infrastructure (e.g. inferring the demand patterns); how to deal with the diverse, sparse, voluminous and inaccurate data delivered by an increasingly pervasive sensory infrastructure; how to assimilate real time data and develop stream reasoning capabilities; how to develop and incorporate probabilistic frameworks and new tools to model and visualize risk and uncertainty.

  abstract = {Individuals with serious mental illness experience changes in their clinical states over time that are difficult to assess and that result in increased disease burden and care utilization. It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual’s own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92\%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p{$<$}0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p{$<$}0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p{$<$}0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p{$<$}0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p{$<$}0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores. This study brings together longitudinal collection of objective behavioral markers along with a transdiagnostic, personalized approach for tracking of mental health clinical state in a community-based clinical setting.},

Paradoxically, these are the very patients that, because of their chronic comorbidities, are at greatest risk for COVID-related morbidity and mortality. DisinfectedPhaenicia(Lucilia)sericata(Medical Maggots; Monarch Labs, Irvine, California) were applied in a standardised fashion by a home-health nurse with direct monitoring, guidance, and collaboration of the attending surgeon. A family member was able to change the outer dressing daily based on normal wound exudate. The inner maggot debridement therapy (MDT) dressing was changed at 2 days showing dramatic reduction in necrotic tissue, elimination of profound malodor, and no evidence of local or advancing infection. The entire initial telehealth-guided application took approximately 20 minutes. The first telehealth-guided MDT dressing change took 14 minutes. We used an artificial-intelligence-based algorithm to measure changes in wound characteristics. At day 0, 46\% of the total surface area was covered in malodorous black, necrotic tissue. The first dressing change saw an elimination in assessed malodor with necrotic tissue constituting 14\% of total surface area. The second dressing change at 5 days showed a greater than 99\% reduction in necrotic tissue. This manuscript constitutes what we believe to be the first telehealth-guided MDT conducted during a resource-limited peri-pandemic period. We believe that MDT, which is an extension of efforts regularly performed in clinic and hospital, may have the potential to reduce resource usage while potentially improving care and quality of life for people with limb and life-threatening complications of diabetes and other chronic diseases.},

  abstract = {Objective Our study compares physician judgement with an automated early warning system (EWS) for predicting clinical deterioration of hospitalised general internal medicine patients. Design Prospective observational study of clinical predictions made at the end of the daytime work-shift for an academic general internal medicine floor team compared with the risk assessment from an automated EWS collected at the same time. Setting Internal medicine teaching wards at a single tertiary care academic medical centre in the USA. Participants Intern physicians working on the internal medicine wards and an automated EWS (Rothman Index by PeraHealth). Outcome Clinical deterioration within 24 hours including cardiac or pulmonary arrest, rapid response team activation or unscheduled intensive care unit transfer. Results We collected predictions for 1874 patient days and saw 35 clinical deteriorations (1.9\%). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for the EWS was 0.73 vs 0.70 for physicians (p=0.571). A linear regression model combining physician and EWS predictions had an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming physicians (p=0.016) and the EWS (p=0.05). Conclusions There is no significant difference in the performance of the EWS and physicians in predicting clinical deterioration at 24 hours on an inpatient general medicine ward. A combined model outperformed either alone. The EWS and physicians identify partially overlapping sets of at-risk patients suggesting they rely on different cues or decision rules for their predictions.Copyright © 2019 Author(s).},

  abstract = {Depression is a prevalent mental disorder. Current clinical and self-reported assessment methods of depression are laborious and incur recall bias. Their sporadic nature often misses severity fluctuations. Previous research highlights the potential of in-situ quantification of human behaviour using mobile sensors to augment traditional methods of depression management. In this paper, we study whether self-reported mood scores and passive smartphone and wearable sensor data could be used to classify people as depressed or non-depressed. In a longitudinal study, our participants provided daily mood (valence and arousal) scores and collected data using their smartphones and Oura Rings. We computed daily aggregations of mood, sleep, physical activity, phone usage, and GPS mobility from raw data to study the differences between the depressed and non-depressed groups and created population-level Machine Learning classification models of depression. We found statistically significant differences in GPS mobility, phone usage, sleep, physical activity and mood between depressed and non-depressed groups. An XGBoost model with daily aggregations of mood and sensor data as predictors classified participants with an accuracy of 81.43\% and an Area Under the Curve of 82.31\%. A Support Vector Machine using only sensor-based predictors had an accuracy of 77.06\% and an Area Under the Curve of 74.25\%. Our results suggest that digital biomarkers are promising in differentiating people with and without depression symptoms. This study contributes to the body of evidence supporting the role of unobtrusive mobile sensor data in understanding depression and its potential to augment depression diagnosis and monitoring.

Among others, emotional state is one of the conditions that could be of interest to doctors or caregivers. This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07\% accuracy (valence), 72.89\% accuracy (arousal), and 53.72\% (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy are leading, evidence-based practices for a variety of problems (e.g., substance abuse), but the evaluation of provider fidelity to behavioral interventions is limited by the need for human judgment. The current study evaluated the accuracy of statistical text classification in replicating human-based judgments of provider fidelity in one specific psychotherapy--motivational interviewing (MI). METHOD: Participants (n\,=\,148) came from five previously conducted randomized trials and were either primary care patients at a safety-net hospital or university students. To be eligible for the original studies, participants met criteria for either problematic drug or alcohol use. All participants received a type of brief motivational interview, an evidence-based intervention for alcohol and substance use disorders. The Motivational Interviewing Skills Code is a standard measure of MI provider fidelity based on human ratings that was used to evaluate all therapy sessions. A text classification approach called a labeled topic model was used to learn associations between human-based fidelity ratings and MI session transcripts. It was then used to generate codes for new sessions. The primary comparison was the accuracy of model-based codes with human-based codes. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of model-based codes showed reasonably strong sensitivity and specificity with those from human raters (range of area under ROC curve (AUC) scores: 0.62 - 0.81; average AUC: 0.72). Agreement with human raters was evaluated based on talk turns as well as code tallies for an entire session. Generated codes had higher reliability with human codes for session tallies and also varied strongly by individual code. CONCLUSION: To scale up the evaluation of behavioral interventions, technological solutions will be required. The current study demonstrated preliminary, encouraging findings regarding the utility of statistical text classification in bridging this methodological gap.},

  abstract = {The idea of rural banks was introduced as a result of limited commercial bank branches in rural areas to mobilize their resources for rural development. It is also believed that financial institutions such as rural banks are powerful tools for mitigating poverty. Nevertheless, some of these banks are rather increasing the burden of people through illegal activities and mismanagement of resources. Assessing banks' performance using a set of financial ratios has been an interesting and challenging problem for many researchers and practitioners. Identification of factors that can accurately predict a firm's performance is of great interest to any decision-maker. The study used ARB's financial ratios as its independent variables to assess the performance of rural banks and later used random forest algorithm to identify the variables with the most relevance to the model. A dataset was obtained from the various banks. This study used three decision tree algorithms, namely, C5.0, C4.5, and CART, to build the various decision tree predictive models. The result of the study suggested that the C5.0 algorithm gave an accuracy of 100\%, followed by the CART algorithm with an accuracy of 84.6\% and, finally, the C4.5 algorithm with an accuracy of 83.34 on average. The study, therefore, recommended the usage of the C5.0 predictive model in predicting the financial performance of rural banks in Ghana.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to propose an automated mobile app labeling framework based on a novel app classification scheme that is aligned with users' primary motivations for using smartphones. The study addresses the gaps in incorporating the needs of users and other context information in app classification as well as recommendation systems. Design/methodology/approach Based on a corpus of mobile app descriptions collected from Google Play store, this study applies extensive text analytics and topic modeling procedures to profile mobile apps within the categories of the classification scheme. Sufficient number of representative and labeled app descriptions are then used to train a classifier using machine learning algorithms, such as rule-based, decision tree and artificial neural network. Findings Experimental results of the classifiers show high accuracy in automatically labeling new apps based on their descriptions. The accuracy of the classification results suggests a feasible direction in facilitating app searching and retrieval in different Web-based usage environments. Research limitations/implications As a common challenge in textual data projects, the problem of data size and data quality issues exists throughout the multiple phases of experiments. Future research will extend the data collection scope in many aspects to address the issues that constrained the current experiments. Practical implications These empirical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of textual data analysis in profiling apps and user context information. This study also benefits app developers by improving app descriptions through a better understanding of user needs and context information. Finally, the classification framework can also guide practitioners in customizing products and services beyond mobile apps where context information and user needs play an important role. Social implications Given the widespread usage and applications of smartphones today, the proposed app classification framework will have broader implications to different Web-based application environments. Originality/value While there have been other classification approaches in the literature, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this framework is the first study on building an automated app labeling framework based on primary motivations of smartphone usage.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic showed an urgent need for decision support systems to help doctors at a time of stress and uncertainty. However, significant differences in hospital conditions, as well as skepticism of doctors about machine learning algorithms, limit their introduction into clinical practice. Our goal was to test and apply the principle of "patient-like-mine" decision support in rapidly changing conditions of a pandemic. Method(s): In the developed system we implemented a fuzzy search that allows a doctor to compare their medical case with similar cases recorded in their medical center since the beginning of the pandemic. Various distance metrics were tried for obtaining clinically relevant search results. With the use of R programming language, we designed the first version of the system in approximately a week. A set of features for the comparison of the cases was selected with the use of random forest algorithm implemented in Caret. Shiny package was chosen for the design of GUI. Result(s): The deployed tool allowed doctors to quickly estimate the current conditions of their patients by means of studying the most similar previous cases stored in the local health information system. The extensive testing of the system during the first wave of COVID-19 showed that this approach helps not only to draw a conclusion about the optimal treatment tactics and to train medical staff in real-time but also to optimize patients' individual testing plans. Conclusion(s): This project points to the possibility of rapid prototyping and effective usage of "patient-like-mine" search systems at the time of a pandemic caused by a poorly known pathogen.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {A large spectrum of healthcare applications, ranging from continuous blood sugar level monitoring to sleep apnea detection are nowadays facilitated by modern mobile gadgets. Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture. The results indicate that the proposed architecture is feasible to enable real-time healthcare services and has significant performance advantages over traditional cloud-based approaches.},

In this work, safety and efficiency of drug that is used for diabetes and to provide justification using statistical approach is proposed. The benefits and harm of various drugs are represented as null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis using two-tailed t test (unpaired hypothesis testing). The drugs specified are given periodically at various weeks so that the effect of each drug is identified with clinical parameters and it is summarized. The various medications that are to be imposed on various groups of people and respected hypothesis values are calculated. The post hoc power, evaluation of p value that specify the significant change in the clinical parameters are observed. With the help of this p value and the hypothesis testing, it recommends the correct specification of drugs.

  abstract = {Telehealth is the usage of digital medical data and telecommunication technologies to aid long-distance clinical healthcare. Proper maintenance of a patient's medical record has been a hindrance toward the growth of Telehealth services. The patient's data, particularly emergency data, must be available to medical personnel within a short time frame and independent of potential interruption of network connections. In this paper, we propose a Near Field Communication (NFC) wristband that provides access to the medical details, history and contact details of a patient. By this, the doctor or the paramedical officer can provide the patient with the best treatment within a short period of time. This system comes in handy even if the patient is unconscious/unable to answer. The doctor or the paramedical officer can quickly draft a patient's report and send it to the hospital. The proposed framework consists of the following four stages: (i) obtaining emergency medical data with the help of NFC chips, (ii) converting medical report into digital text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), (iii) structuring the narrative medical text into organized data using NLP and (iv) comparative analysis of the selected content. An image database with 1200 medical case histories has been utilized for the algorithm development and validation. The OCR algorithms for converting images to text produced more than 98\% on average and NLP algorithm produced around 94.1\% accuracy. Overall, the performance of the system from NFC reader till analysis of the specific field is more than 95\%. The developed OCR and NLP integrated software helps the doctor or the health officer to immediately convert it into text format and the unstructured text is quickly organized into the respective fields.

  abstract = {In this study, the best artificial intelligence method is investigated to estimate the measured convective heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of R134a flowing downward inside a vertical smooth copper tube having an inner diameter of 8.1 mm and a length of 500 mm during annular flow numerically. R134a and water are used as working fluids in the tube side and annular side of a double tube heat exchanger, respectively. The ANN training sets have the experimental data of in-tube condensation tests including six different mass fluxes of R134a such as 260, 300, 340, 400, 456 and 515 kg m(-2) s(-1), two different saturation temperatures of R134a such as 40 and 50 degrees C and heat fluxes ranging from 10.16 to 66.61 kW m(-2). The quality of the refrigerant in the test section is calculated considering the temperature and pressure obtained from the experiment. The pressure drop across the test section is directly measured by a differential pressure transducer. Input of the ANNs are the measured values of test section such as mass flux, heat flux, the temperature difference between the tube wall and saturation temperature, average vapor quality, while the outputs of the ANNs are the experimental condensation heat transfer coefficient and measured pressure drop in the analysis. Condensation heat transfer characteristics of R134a are modeled to decide the best approach using several artificial neural network (ANN) methods such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis networks (RBFN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Elimination process of the ANN methods is performed by means of 183 data points, divided into two sets randomly, obtained in the experiments. Sets of test and training/validation include 33 and 120/30 data points respectively for the elimination process. Validation process, in terms of various experimental conditions, is done by means of 368 experimental data points having 68 data points for test set and 300 data points for training set. In training phase, 5-fold cross validation is used to determine the best value of ANNs control parameters. The ANNs performances were measured by means of relative error criteria with the usage of unknown test sets. The performance of the method of multi layer perceptron (MLP) with 5-13-1 architecture and radial basis function networks (RBFN) were found to be in good agreement, predicting the experimental condensation heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop with their deviations being within the range of +/- 5\% for all tested conditions. Dependency of outputs of the ANNs from input values is also investigated in the paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The demand outstripping supply of mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic presents opportunities for digital technology tools to fill this new gap and, in the process, demonstrate capabilities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health).Copyright © Luke Balcombe, Diego De Leo.},

Here we utilize random forest classification and pre-treatment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) to generate individual subject treatment outcome predictions. Before cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 48 adults (25 GAD and 23 PD) reduced (via cognitive reappraisal) or maintained their emotional responses to negative images during fMRI scanning. CBT responder status was predicted using activations from 70 anatomically defined regions. The final random forest model included 10 predictors contributing most to classification accuracy. A similar analysis was conducted using the clinical and demographic variables. Activations in the hippocampus during maintenance and anterior insula, superior temporal, supramarginal, and superior frontal gyri during reappraisal were among the best predictors, with greater activation in responders than non-responders. The final fMRI-based model yielded 79\% accuracy, with good sensitivity (0.86), specificity (0.68), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (2.73, 0.20). Clinical and demographic variables yielded poorer accuracy (69\%), sensitivity (0.79), specificity (0.53), and likelihood ratios (1.67, 0.39). This is the first use of random forest models to predict treatment outcome from pre-treatment neuroimaging data in psychiatry. Together, random forest models and fMRI can provide single-subject predictions with good test characteristics. Moreover, activation patterns are consistent with the notion that greater activation in cortico-limbic circuitry predicts better CBT response in GAD and PD.},

The VUCA status has now become a permanent reality: volatility and complexity cannot be traced to traditional corporate operations. The Industry 4.0 projects a physical, a digital and a biological megatrend such as advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, new materials, personalized healing, self-driving cars. Through usage of the resources and knowledge sharing, the global economy is experiencing mutations such as the sharing economy, the peer to peer economy, the gig economy in the labor market and the Big Data in planning. Meanwhile, the disruptive innovations are transforming industries and gaining exponentially competitive advantage. The special business concepts were born and whom cannot be handled by models of classic macro and micro economics: the largest taxi company in the world does not own any taxicab (Uber), the largest accommodation company does not own any property (Airbnb), the largest telecommunication company has no infrastructure (Skype), the world's most valuable retailer has no inventory (Alibaba), the most popular media doesn't create its own content (Facebook), the world's largest cinema doesn't have its own movie (Netflix). In the meantime, those are treasuring huge profits, business influence and information capital. The competitiveness of their agile way of working can be proved. These call for changes not only in the market, but also in organizational and individual terms. An adaptive corporate structure and leadership, a self-organizing group, an agile working method hold companies in the direction of growing track and changes in the future. My research about discovering some aspects of agile way of working versus traditional organization work. My hypothesis is that employees are more motivated, effective and committed in an agile team than in a classic hierarchy or matrix. I added own business and project-based worker as their flexible, effective work is a must. My hypotheses are partially fulfilled.},

We proposed two distinct deep learning models - (i) CNN Word - Glove, and (ii) Domain phrase attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network (DPA-HNN), for synthesizing information on pulmonary emboli (PE) from over 7370 clinical thoracic computed tomography (CT) free-text radiology reports collected from four major healthcare centers. Our proposed DPA-HNN model encodes domain-dependent phrases into an attention mechanism and represents a radiology report through a hierarchical RNN structure composed of word-level, sentence-level and document-level representations. Experimental results suggest that the performance of the deep learning models that are trained on a single institutional dataset, are better than rule-based PEFinder on our multi-institutional test sets. The best F1 score for the presence of PE in an adult patient population was 0.99 (DPA-HNN) and for a pediatrics population was 0.99 (HNN) which shows that the deep learning models being trained on adult data, demonstrated generalizability to pediatrics population with comparable accuracy. Our work suggests feasibility of broader usage of neural network models in automated classification of multi-institutional imaging text reports for a variety of applications including evaluation of imaging utilization, imaging yield, clinical decision support tools, and as part of automated classification of large corpus for medical imaging deep learning work.

Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments-based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T-related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.},

  abstract = {Increasing rate of water pollution and consequently waterborne diseases are the engrossing evidence towards danger to living organisms. It becomes a great challenge these days to preserve our flora and fauna by controlling various unexpected pollution activities. Although the invention of many schemes and programmes regarding water purification has done a tremendous job, but still there is something that has been lagging. With increase in population, industrialization and global warming situation is getting worse day by day. It becomes very difficult to get safe drinking water and appropriate quality water for other domestic usage and agriculture purpose. Major reasons for water pollution include undesirable increase in impurities. These may cause eutrophication of the water body, change in taste, discolouration and odour of water, water borne diseases, increase in water toxic nature etc. For water to be serviceable it should be aesthetically acceptable, chemically safe, bacteria free; organic substances and radioactive elements should be absent. So, there is an urgent need to look into this situation and take the corrective and necessary actions to overcome this situation. The government is paying an attention to this problem and finding the ways to control the situation. However, major areas are not developed to the point and water quality estimation is totally dependent upon sampling at location and testing in laboratories. Manual sampling and measurements are prone to human errors and these techniques may create ambiguities in predicted output. In this paper we have presented Machine Learning (ML) approach for calculating the Water Quality Index (WQI) and classification of water quality to estimate water characteristics for usage. For analysis, decision tree method is used to estimate water quality information. The standard values of parameters are selected as per guidelines provided by World Health organization (WHO). Results calculated using ML techniques showed prominent accuracy over traditional methods. Accuracy achieved is also significant, i.e. 98 \%. Likewise, projection of gathered data was done utilizing web interface and web app to alert the authorities about contamination.},

Consequently, this necessitates further reflection on how to best apply aspects of ethical behavior to the development and usage of technology in the public sector. The significant role of the technology ethics in public service has received meager consideration in the literature, lacking a theoretical foundation that can help guide practitioners (as techno-ethicists) through rapid transitions in technological progress. Using the philosophy of technology literature, this article seeks to address this gap in public administration theory by considering first, how technological advancements affect the nature of didactic power relationships between the public and government; and second how the concept of technological nonneutrality is framed as a basis for structuring what obligations public administrators have when adopting and using technology in public service. This includes reflection upon the expanding role of newer technologies such as Artificial Intelligence in reshaping the nature of government-society relationships. Framing techno-ethical principles in theoretical dialogue prompts greater awareness for how practitioners may effectively respond as moral agents to rapidly changing technological advancements.},

Methods An anemia control model (ACM), certified as MD, may face adverse events as a result of wrong predictions that are translated into suggestions of doses of erythropoietic stimulating agents to dialysis patients. Risks are assessed as the combination of severity and probability of a given hazard. While severities are typically assessed by clinicians, probabilities are tightly related to the performance of the predictive model. Results A postmarketing data set formed by all adult patients registered in French, Portuguese, and Spanish clinics, belonging to an international network, was considered; 3876 patients and 11,508 suggestions were eventually included. The achieved results show that there are no statistical differences between the probabilities of adverse events that are estimated in the ACM test set (using only Spanish clinics) and those actually observed in the postmarketing cohort. Conclusions The risks of an ACM-MD can be accurately and robustly estimated, thus enhancing patients' safety. The proposed methodology is applicable to other clinical decisions based on predictive models since our proposal does not depend on the particular predictive model.},

In fact, many of these "standard" descriptors are now readily available via open source, easy-to-use computational tools. As a result, it is not uncommon to take advantage of large numbers - up to thousands in some cases - of these descriptors to predict the functional properties of drug-like molecules. This "strength in numbers" approach does usually provide excellent flexibility - and thus, good numerical accuracy - to the machine learning framework of choice; however, it suffers from a lack of transparency, in that it becomes very challenging to pinpoint the - usually, few - descriptors that are playing a key role in determining the functional properties of a given molecule. In this work, we show that just a handful of well-tailored molecular descriptors may often be capable to predict the functional properties of drug-like molecules with an accuracy comparable to that obtained by using hundreds of standard descriptors. In particular, we apply feature selection and genetic algorithms to in-house descriptors we have developed building on junction trees and symmetry functions, respectively. We find that information from as few as 10-20 molecular fragments is often enough to predict with decent accuracy even complex biomedical activities. In addition, we demonstrate that the usage of small sets of optimised symmetry functions may pave the way towards the prediction of the physical properties of drugs in their solid phases - a pivotal challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, this work brings strong arguments in support of the usage of small numbers of selected descriptors to discover the structure-function relation of drug-like molecules - as opposed to blindly leveraging the flexibility of the thousands of molecular descriptors currently available.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Like most real-world data, electronic health record (EHR)-derived data from oncology patients typically exhibits wide interpatient variability in terms of available data elements. This interpatient variability leads to missing data and can present critical challenges in developing and implementing predictive models to underlie clinical decision support for patient-specific oncology care. Here, we sought to develop a novel ensemble approach to addressing missing data that we term the "meta-model" and apply the meta-model to patient-specific cancer prognosis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-world data, we developed a suite of individual random survival forest models to predict survival in patients with advanced lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Individual models varied by the predictor data used. We combined models for each cancer type into a meta-model that predicted survival for each patient using a weighted mean of the individual models for which the patient had all requisite predictors., RESULTS: The meta-model significantly outperformed many of the individual models and performed similarly to the best performing individual models. Comparisons of the meta-model to a more traditional imputation-based method of addressing missing data supported the meta-model's utility., CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel machine learning-based strategy to underlie clinical decision support and predict survival in cancer patients, despite missing data. The meta-model may more generally provide a tool for addressing missing data across a variety of clinical prediction problems. Moreover, the meta-model may address other challenges in clinical predictive modeling including model extensibility and integration of predictive algorithms trained across different institutions and datasets.

  abstract = {Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs. (J Med Internet Res 2013;15(2):e41) doi:10.2196/jmir.2353},

Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous. Organizations will need to approach this domain carefully with knowledgeable partners to obtain the hoped-for benefits and avoid failures.},

Struggling to cure infected patients while continuing to care for patients with other pathologies, health authorities have faced the lack of medical staff and infrastructure. This study aimed to investigate the acceptance of teleconsultation solutions by patients, which help to avoid the spread of the disease during this pandemic period. The model was built using some constructs of the technology acceptance model UTAUT2, Personal traits, Availability, and Perceived Risks. A new scale on Contamination Avoidance was developed by the authors. The questionnaire was disseminated in several countries in Europe and Asia and a total sample of 386 respondents was collected. The results emphasize the huge impact of Performance Expectancy, the negative influence of Perceived Risk, and the positive influence of Contamination Avoidance on the adoption of teleconsultation solutions. The findings highlight the moderating effects of Age, Gender, and Country.},

In this Review, we discuss some of the challenges to developing effective automation for psychiatry to optimise physician treatment of individual patients. Using the perspective of automation experts in other industries, three examples of automation in the delivery of routine care are reviewed: (1) effects of electronic medical records on the patient interview; (2) effects of complex systems integration on e-prescribing; and (3) use of clinical decision support to assist with clinical decision making. An increased understanding of the experience of automation from other sectors might allow for more effective deployment of technology in psychiatry.},

Nine facilities were enrolled from all VA facilities in the United States to receive CCM implementation support. All veterans (n\,=\,5596) treated by designated outpatient general mental health teams were included for hospitalization analyses, and a randomly selected sample (n\,=\,1050) was identified for health status interviews. Individuals with dementia were excluded. Clinicians (n\,=\,62) at the facilities were surveyed, and site process summaries were rated for concordance with the CCM process. The CCM implementation start time was randomly assigned across 3 waves. Data analysis of this evaluable population was performed from June to September 2018.Internal-external facilitation, combining a study-funded external facilitator and a facility-funded internal facilitator working with a designated team for 1 year.Facilitation was hypothesized to be associated with improvements in both implementation and intervention outcomes (hybrid type II trial). Implementation outcomes included the clinician Team Development Measure (TDM) and proportion of CCM-concordant team care processes. The study was powered for the primary health outcome, mental component score (MCS). Hospitalization rate was derived from administrative data.The veteran population (n\,=\,5596) included 881 women (15.7\%), and the  mean (SD) age was 52.2\,(14.5) years. The interviewed sample (n\,=\,1050) was similar but was oversampled for women (n\,=\,210 [20.0\%]). Facilitation was associated with improvements in TDM subscales for role clarity (53.4\%-68.6\%; δ\,=\,15.3; 95\% CI, 4.4-26.2; P\,=\,.01) and team primacy (50.0\%-68.6\%; δ\,=\,18.6; 95\% CI, 8.3-28.9; P\,=\,.001). The percentage of CCM-concordant processes achieved varied, ranging from 44\% to 89\%. No improvement was seen in veteran self-ratings, including the primary outcome. In post hoc analyses, MCS improved in veterans with 3 or more treated mental health diagnoses compared with others (β\,=\,5.03; 95\% CI, 2.24-7.82; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Mental health hospitalizations demonstrated a robust decrease during facilitation (β\,=\,–0.12; 95\% CI, –0.16 to –0.07; P\,\&lt;\,.001); this finding withstood 4 internal validity tests.Implementation facilitation that engages clinicians under typical practice conditions can enhance evidence-based team processes; its effect on self-reported overall population health status was negligible, although health status improved for individuals with complex conditions and hospitalization rate declined.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02543840},

  abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) is one of the prevalent mental ailments worldwide and is manually diagnosed by skilled medical professionals. Nowadays electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based machine learning methods have been proposed to help medical professionals. Materials and method: In this work, we have proposed a novel Collatz conjecture-based automated schizophrenia detection model using EEG signals. The objectives of the presented model are to show the feature generation ability of conjecture-based structure and present a highly accurate EEG-based schizophrenia detection model with low time burden. Our presented model comprises three stages. (i) New feature generation function is presented using Collatz Conjecture, and named as Collatz pattern. Combination of Collatz pattern and maximum absolute pooling decomposer, a new multilevel feature generation method is employed to extract both low-level and high-level features. (ii) The iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA) is employed on the selected features to select the clinically significant features. (iii) The chosen features are fed to k nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for automated deetction of SZ. Results: Our developed Collatz conjecture-based automated SZ detection model is validated using two public schizophrenia databases with 19 and 10 channels corresponding to database-1 (DB1) and database-2 (DB2) datasets, respectively. We have obtained the classification accuracy of 99.47\% and 93.58\% for DB1 and DB2 datasets, respectively, with ten-fold cross-validation strategy. Conclusions: Our developed model is accurate and robust in detecting SZ using EEG signals. Our deevloped automated system is ready for clinical usage in hospitals and polyclinics to assist clinicians in their diagnosis as an adjunct tool.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Conundrum health care providers and institutions face is how to deliver evidence-based medical care at lower cost to an ever expanding portion of society in need. Translation of clinical studies to daily practice and adoption of national and international guidelines have not met expectations. This disappointing shortfall stems primarily from lack of interface between ever growing and changing vast medical literature and individual patient profile. Concurrently, threats of penalties for underperformance and poor reimbursement related to improper documentation are increasing. Hence, transition to comprehensive clinical decision support systems (CDSS) will not just be inevitable but also rewarding. Purpose(s): Examine the level of correlation between the novel CDSS and health care providers' clinical decisions. Method(s): CDSS for diagnosis and treatment of HF (Cardiologist Evaluator) was developed using a USPO patented methodology with artificial intelligence to function as an assistant to health care provider. It serves as a search engine to select evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic options for an individual patient. A total of 389 patients with suspected HF were available between 2017 and 2018 at a suburban tertiary care hospital. Both Cardiologist Evaluator and health care providers (mid-level practitioner or junior faculty) gave recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment for each patient independently. Concordance rate between Cardiologist Evaluator recommendations and actual health care providers' decisions was evaluated. Furthermore, ICD-10 coding provided by Cardiologist Evaluator was compared to ICD-10 coding of health care provider for immediate cost effectiveness evaluation. Recommendations given by Cardiologist Evaluator were later presented to board certified HF cardiologists who were then asked if they find them acceptable or unacceptable for care of each individual patient. New concordance rate, this time between Cardiologist Evaluator and HF specialist was evaluated. Result(s): Overall concordance rate between Cardiologist Evaluator recommendations and actual healthcare providers' decisions was 69.7\%. Most discrepancies were related to adoption of new therapies, dose advancements, workup for new onset heart failure, and/or referral for LVAD. HF specialists found recommendations given by Cardiologist Evaluator acceptable 99.3\% of the time. Overall concordance rate between Cardiologist Evaluator and HF specialists was 98.9\%. Cardiologist evaluator provided superior, automated ICD-10 coding in order of relevance. Conclusion(s): Cardiologist Evaluator shows high accuracy in evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of HF. It may be useful for consistent implementation of clinical guidelines and more reliable coding, especially in centers without HF specialists.Copyright © 2019},

Method Therapists (n = 795) responded to a survey about their TPT experiences during the pandemic, including quality of the therapeutic relationship, professional self-doubt, vicarious trauma and TPT acceptance. Regression decision tree machine learning analyses were used to build prediction models for each of three aspects of TPT acceptance in a training subset of the data and subsequently tested in the remaining subset of the total sample. Results Attitudes towards TPT were most positive for therapists who reported a neutral or strong online working alliance with their patients, especially if they experienced little professional self-doubt and were younger than 40 years old. Therapists who were most concerned about TPT were those who reported higher levels of professional self-doubt, particularly if they also reported vicarious trauma experiences. Therapists who reported low working alliance with their patients were least likely to use TPT in the future. Performance metrics for the decision trees indicated that these three models held up well in an out-of-sample dataset. Conclusions Therapists' professional self-doubt and the quality of their working alliance with their online patients appear to be the most pertinent factors associated with therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during COVID-19 and should be addressed in future training and research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Renal anemia management remains challenging for the nephrologist. Chronic inflammation, EPO resistance, uremia, malnutrition, iron deficiency, dialysis modalities, bleeding, infections, hydration status all interfere with erythropoiesis and erythrocytes half-life. Since 2013, {$>$}100 clinics in the FMC Nephrocare network have been using the Anemia Control Model (ACM), an artificial-intelligence based, certified medical device, decision support tool, to assist nephrologists in optimizing the monthly ESA and iron dose based on the specific characteristics of the patient and the amount of ESA dose already taken in the last 90 days. Based on this widespread experience, we sought to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the use of ACM to facilitate hemoglobin target achievement among dialysis patients. METHOD(S): In this historical cohort study, we analyzed electronic health records (EHR) of adult patients receiving in-center hemodialysis therapy in Fresenius Medical Care European dialysis clinics between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2018 registered in the European Clinical Database (EuCliD ). We compared the rate of target achievement between patients treated with the ESA dose, suggested by ACM, against three control groups of patients treated in clinics without ACM and stratified by different target achievement rates for hemoglobin (Hb in the range of 10-12 g/dL or {$>$} 12 g/dL without ESA administration) (Fig. 1). To decrease indication bias, we matched patients belonging to the four comparison groups by a propensity-score assessing the likelihood of receiving the same dose suggested by ACM based on patients' characteristics (i.e. demographic, comorbidities, anemia-related biomarkers and dialysis vintage). Centers where Hb target achievement {$<$} 70\% were classified as Tier 1 centers; centers where Hb target achievement was between 70\% and 80\% were classified as Tier 2 centers, and centers where Hb target achievement was {$>$}80\% were classified as Tier 3 centers. Performance was evaluated in the month before the index date for all the patients in any given clinic. For each matched group, the index date corresponds to the date of dose suggestion (ACM group) or to the last Hb assessment date (for all matched patients belonging to other three control groups). The study endpoints were Hb target achievement, inappropriate ESA administration (ESA administration despite Hb {$>$} 12 g/dL) and severe anemia (Hb {$<$} 9 g/dL). All endpoints have been evaluated in the month following the index date. RESULT(S): After matching, we obtained four groups accounting for 8 5512 patientmonths each. There were negligible differences in patients' characteristics across the four matched groups (Table 1). In the ACM group, the Hb target achievement rate was 87.52/100 patient-months 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 86.89-88.15], inappropriate ESA use rate was 4.13/100 patient-months (95\% CI: 3.99-4.27) and the incidence of severe anemia was 2.14/100 patient-months (95\% CI: 2.04-2.24); the Hb target achievement rate ratio (95\% CI) was 1.18 (1.17-1.2), 1.08 (1.07-1.09), 1.01 (1-1.02) for ACM versus Tier 1 centers, ACM versus Tier 2 centers and ACM versus Tier 3 centers, respectively. Rate ratio for inappropriate ESA administration were 0.37 (0.36-0.39), 0.49 (0.47-0.51), 0.66 (0.64-0.69) for ACM versus Tier 1 centers, ACM versus Tier 2 centers and ACM versus Tier 3 centers, respectively. The risk ratios for severe anemia were 0.43 (0.41-0.46), 0.65 (0.62-0.7), 0.95 (0.89-1.02) for ACM versus Tier 1 centers, ACM versus Tier 2 centers and ACM versus Tier 3 centers, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In this matched historical cohort study, we observed an increased hemoglobin target achievement rate, decreased inappropriate ESA usage and a decreased incidence of severe anemia among patients treated according to ACM suggestions. Target achievement rate among patients treated according to ACM suggestions was 87\%. The magnitude of the effect in favor of ACM was larger in centers with a lower target achievement rate.},

  abstract = {CHRONIOUS system is an integrated platform aiming at the management of chronic disease patients. One of the most important components of the system is a Decision Support System (DSS) that has been developed in a Smart Device (SD). This component decides on patient's current health status by combining several data, which are acquired either by wearable sensors or manually inputted by the patient or retrieved from the specific database. In case no abnormal situation has been tracked, the DSS takes no action and remains deactivated until next abnormal situation pack of data are being acquired or next scheduled data being transmitted. The DSS that has been implemented is an integrated classification system with two parallel classifiers, combining an expert system (rule-based system) and a supervised classifier, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, artificial Neural Networks (aNN like the Multi-Layer Perceptron), Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. The above categorized system is useful for providing critical information about the health status of the patient.},

  abstract = {Background: Data collected by health care organizations consist of medical information and documentation of interactions with patients through different communication channels. This enables the health care organization to measure various features of its performance such as activity, efficiency, adherence to a treatment, and different quality indicators. This information can be linked to sociodemographic, clinical, and communication data with the health care providers and administrative teams. Analyzing all these measurements together may provide insights into the different types of patient behaviors or more accurately to the different types of interactions patients have with the health care organizations. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to characterize usage profiles of the available communication channels with the health care organization. The main objective is to suggest new ways to encourage the usage of the most appropriate communication channel based on the patient's profile. The first hypothesis is that the patient's follow-up and clinical outcomes are influenced by the patient's preferred communication channels with the health care organization. The second hypothesis is that the adoption of newly introduced communication channels between the patient and the health care organization is influenced by the patient's sociodemographic or clinical profile. The third hypothesis is that the introduction of a new communication channel influences the usage of existing communication channels. Methods: All relevant data will be extracted from the Clalit Health Services data warehouse, the largest health care management organization in Israel. Data analysis process will use data mining approach as a process of discovering new knowledge and dealing with processing data extracted with statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and information visualization tools. More specifically, we will mainly use the k-means clustering algorithm for discretization purposes and patients' profile building, a hierarchical clustering algorithm, and heat maps for generating a visualization of the different communication profiles. In addition, patients' interviews will be conducted to complement the information drawn from the data analysis phase with the aim of suggesting ways to optimize existing communication flows. Results: The project was funded in 2016. Data analysis is currently under way and the results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2019. Identification of patient profiles will allow the health care organization to improve its accessibility to patients and their engagement, which in turn will achieve a better treatment adherence, quality of care, and patient experience. Conclusions: Defining solutions to increase patient accessibility to health care organization by matching the communication channels to the patient's profile and to change the health care organization's communication with the patient to a highly proactive one will increase the patient's engagement according to his or her profile.},

  abstract = {Background: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. Methods: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. Results: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8\%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. Conclusions: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.},

  abstract = {Background               About 30\% of patients drop out of cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), which has implications for psychiatric and psychological treatment. Findings concerning drop out remain heterogeneous.                                         Aims               This paper aims to compare different machine-learning algorithms using nested cross-validation, evaluate their benefit in naturalistic settings, and identify the best model as well as the most important variables.                                         Method               The data-set consisted of 2543 out-patients treated with CBT. Assessment took place before session one. Twenty-one algorithms and ensembles were compared. Two parameters (Brier score, area under the curve (AUC)) were used for evaluation.                                         Results                                The best model was an ensemble that used Random Forest and nearest-neighbour modelling. During the training process, it was significantly better than generalised linear modelling (GLM) (Brier score:                 d                 = –2.93, 95\% CI (−3.95, −1.90)); AUC:                 d                 = 0.59, 95\% CI (0.11 to 1.06)). In the holdout sample, the ensemble was able to correctly identify 63.4\% of cases of patients, whereas the GLM only identified 46.2\% correctly. The most important predictors were lower education, lower scores on the Personality Style and Disorder Inventory (PSSI) compulsive scale, younger age, higher scores on the PSSI negativistic and PSSI antisocial scale as well as on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) additional scale (mean of the four additional items) and BSI overall scale.                                                        Conclusions               Machine learning improves drop-out predictions. However, not all algorithms are suited to naturalistic data-sets and binary events. Tree-based and boosted algorithms including a variable selection process seem well-suited, whereas more advanced algorithms such as neural networks do not.},

Here, we investigate the feasibility of such a system using a real-world open-science dataset. In particular, we are interested in whether passive technology interaction patterns in real-world datasets reflect findings from more controlled research trials, and the implications for clinical care. Data from 328 people who downloaded an open-science app was analyzed using a variety of machine learning methods, including different modeling methods (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks), different types of class rebalancing, and pre-processing techniques. The aim was to predict fluctuations in PHQ scores in the weeks before the fluctuation occurred. Various feature selection methods were also employed to identify the top features driving the predictive patterns (out of total 54 starting features). Results showed predictive accuracy around \textasciitilde{} 90\%, similar to controlled research trials, while revealing a number of interesting features (e.g. PTSD and mood instability) that suggest future research avenues. The findings from our analysis appear to indicate that real-world interaction data from smartphones can be utilized as an EWS monitoring tool for mood disorders like bipolar. We also discuss the broader applicability of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches to connected systems combining different forms of pervasive technology interaction (smartphones, wearables, social robots) to track everyday health status.

  abstract = {Background: The emergence of smartphones, wearable sensor technologies, and smart homes allows the nonintrusive collection of activity data. Thus, health-related events, such as activities of daily living (ADLs; eg, mobility patterns, feeding, sleeping, ...) can be captured without patients' active participation. We designed a system to detect changes in the mobility patterns based on the smartphone's native sensors and advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques. Objective: The principal objective of this work is to assess the feasibility of detecting mobility pattern changes in a sample of outpatients with depression using the smartphone's sensors. The proposed method processed the data acquired by the smartphone using an unsupervised detection technique. Methods: In this study, 38 outpatients from the Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz Psychiatry Department (Madrid, Spain) participated. The Evidence-Based Behavior (eB(2)) app was downloaded by patients on the day of recruitment and configured with the assistance of a physician. The app captured the following data: inertial sensors, physical activity, phone calls and message logs, app usage, nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, and location. We applied a change-point detection technique to location data on a sample of 9 outpatients recruited between April 6, 2017 and December 14, 2017. The change-point detection was based only on location information, but the eB(2) platform allowed for an easy integration of additional data. The app remained running in the background on patients' smartphone during the study participation. Results: The principal outcome measure was the identification of mobility pattern changes based on an unsupervised detection technique applied to the smartphone's native sensors data. Here, results from 5 patients' records are presented as a case series. The eB(2) system detected specific mobility pattern changes according to the patients' activity, which may be used as indicators of behavioral and clinical state changes. Conclusions: The proposed technique could automatically detect changes in the mobility patterns of outpatients who took part in this study. Assuming these mobility pattern changes correlated with behavioral changes, we have developed a technique that may identify possible relapses or clinical changes. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the detected changes are not always related to relapses and that some clinical changes cannot be detected by the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Objective: Over the last decade, an increase in research on medical decision support systems has been observed. However, compared to other disciplines, decision support systems in mental health are still in the minority, especially for rare diseases like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art digital decision support systems (DDSSs) for PTSD. Method(s): Based on our systematic literature review of DDSSs for PTSD, we created an analytical framework using thematic analysis for feature extraction and quantitative analysis for the literature. Based on this framework, we extracted information around the medical domain of DDSSs, the data used, the technology used for data collection, user interaction, decision-making, user groups, validation, decision type and maturity level. Extracting data for all of these framework dimensions ensures consistency in our analysis and gives a holistic overview of DDSSs. Result(s): Research on DDSSs for PTSD is rare and primarily deals with the algorithmic part of DDSSs (n = 17). Only one DDSS was found to be a usable product. From a data perspective, mostly checklists or questionnaires were used (n = 9). While the median sample size of 151 was rather low, the average accuracy was 82\%. Validation, excluding algorithmic accuracy (like user acceptance), was mostly neglected, as was an analysis concerning possible user groups. Conclusion(s): Based on a systematic literature review, we developed a framework covering all parts (medical domain, data used, technology used for data collection, user interaction, decision-making, user groups, validation, decision type and maturity level) of DDSSs. Our framework was then used to analyze DDSSs for post-traumatic stress disorder. We found that DDSSs are not ready-to-use products but are mostly algorithms based on secondary datasets. This shows that there is still a gap between technical possibilities and real-world clinical work.Copyright © 2022 Bertl, Metsallik and Ross.},

This was a multinational, cross-sectional descriptive study. Data of 130 children (aged 12-18 years) with cerebral palsy were collected between June 2005 and June 2015. The logistic regression-based model uses an algorithm implemented in R programming language. After splitting the patients in training and testing sets, logistic regressions are performed on every possible subset (tuple) of independent variables. The tuple that shows the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity is chosen as a set of independent variables in another logistic regression to calculate the probability to develop the specific health condition (e.g. the need for gastrostomy). The average of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity score was 90\%. Our model represents a novelty in the field of some cerebral palsy-related health outcomes treatment, and it should significantly help doctors' decision-making process regarding patient prognosis.},

Therefore, we present drug recommender systems with a stacked artificial neural network (ANN) model to improve the fairness and safety of treatment for infectious diseases. To reduce side effects, drugs are recommended based on a patient's previous health profile, lifestyle, and habits. The proposed system produced results with 97.5\% accuracy.

  abstract = {Context: Over the last decade, Agile methods have changed the software development process in an unparalleled way and with the increasing popularity of Big Data, optimizing development cycles through data analytics is becoming a commodity. Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment. Whereas, thanks to this literature review, practitioners should be able to understand better how to obtain actionable insights from their software artifacts and on which aspects of data analytics to focus when investing in such initiatives.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Cell population data (CPD) parameters from Beckman-Coulter DXH800 analyzers provide volume, conductivity and scatter measures for leucocyte subpopulations. In the present study, fourteen lymphoid CPD parameters were used to design, develop and implement novel machine learning (ML) algorithms as a support tool for lymphocyte related diagnosis. Method(s): Three categories were selected that included healthy controls, reactive lymphocytosis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples. A model-building data set (n=300) was used for the feature analysis including 1) ANOVA, 2) unsupervised K-Means clustering, and 3) principal component analysis (PCA) of both unlabeled and labeled data. Secondly, supervised ML algorithms were built for true classification purposes. The different prediction models (6 in total) were built and tested using the model-building dataset, and then evaluated through ten-fold cross validation. The validation was carried out using an independent validation dataset (n=100) covering all three categories. Result(s): 1) The ANOVA revealed that CPD parameters displayed significant differences among the three categories, 2) K-Means clustering segregated the categories in control and pathological groups (for K=2 clusters) or three diagnostic categories (for K=3) revealing association between cluster and specific category. PCA allowed to asses cluster validity and yielded 2 variables (SD conductivity and Mean volume) with significant discriminatory potential. The best model after ten-fold cross validation corresponded to neural network (NN) classifier, with an accuracy of 96.70\%, followed by support vector machines (94.90\%), k-nearest neighbor (94.00\%) and random forest (94.00\%) classifiers. Individual classification accuracies with NN algorithm corresponded to 100\%, 94.5\% and 96.0\% for the controls, reactive, and CLL groups, respectively. Conclusion(s): For five of the tested models the obtained accuracies for the validation dataset were over the 90\%, indicating that the ML algorithms have an impressive discriminatory potential. The NN algorithm appears to be very promising as a support system for medical diagnosis in lymphoproliferative disorders. Longitudinal validation studies with larger patient cohorts will be interesting for the consolidation of these models as a decision support tool in the clinical practice. Notwithstanding the tremendous aid that this algorithm poses for medical diagnosis one should never ease into the pitfall of ruling out human involvement.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being used in healthcare, thanks to the high level of performance that these systems have proven to deliver. So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions-conceptual, methodological and procedural-that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.

  abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Drug-related problems (DRPs) are of serious concern worldwide, particularly for the elderly who often take many medications simultaneously. Medication reviews have been demonstrated to improve medication usage, leading to reductions in DRPs and potential savings in healthcare costs. However, medication reviews are not always of a consistently high standard, and there is often room for improvement in the quality of their findings. Our aim was to produce computerized intelligent decision support software that can improve the consistency and quality of medication review reports, by helping to ensure that DRPs relevant to a patient are overlooked less frequently. A system that largely achieved this goal was previously published, but refinements have been made. This paper examines the results of both the earlier and newer systems., METHODS: Two prototype multiple-classification ripple-down rules medication review systems were built, the second being a refinement of the first. Each of the systems was trained incrementally using a human medication review expert. The resultant knowledge bases were analysed and compared, showing factors such as accuracy, time taken to train, and potential errors avoided., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The two systems performed well, achieving accuracies of approximately 80\% and 90\%, after being trained on only a small number of cases (126 and 244 cases, respectively). Through analysis of the available data, it was estimated that without the system intervening, the expert training the first prototype would have missed approximately 36\% of potentially relevant DRPs, and the second 43\%. However, the system appeared to prevent the majority of these potential expert errors by correctly identifying the DRPs for them, leaving only an estimated 8\% error rate for the first expert and 4\% for the second., WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: These intelligent decision support systems have shown a clear potential to substantially improve the quality and consistency of medication reviews, which should in turn translate into improved medication usage if they were implemented into routine use.

Existing relapse evaluation strategies are limited by their reliance on direct and timely contact with professionals, and accurate reporting of symptoms. A method by which to objectively identify early relapse warning signs could facilitate swift intervention. We collected 52,815 Facebook posts across 51 participants with recent onset psychosis (mean age = 23.96 years; 70.58\% male) and applied anomaly detection to explore linguistic and behavioral changes associated with psychotic relapse. We built a one-class classification model that makes patient-specific personalized predictions on risk to relapse. Significant differences were identified in the words posted to Facebook in the month preceding a relapse hospitalization compared to periods of relative health, including increased usage of words belonging to the swear (p {$<$} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test), anger (p {$<$} 0.001), and death (p {$<$} 0.0001) categories, decreased usage of words belonging to work (p = 0.00579), friends (p {$<$} 0.0001), and health (p {$<$} 0.0001) categories, as well as a significantly increased use of first (p {$<$} 0.0001) and second-person (p {$<$} 0.001) pronouns. We additionally observed a significant increase in co-tagging (p {$<$} 0.001) and friending (p {$<$} 0.0001) behaviors in the month before a relapse hospitalization. Our classifier achieved a specificity of 0.71 in predicting relapse. Results indicate that social media activity captures objective linguistic and behavioral markers of psychotic relapse in young individuals with recent onset psychosis. Machine-learning models were capable of making personalized predictions of imminent relapse hospitalizations at the patient-specific level.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Management of patients in the acute care setting requires accurate diagnosis and rapid initiation of validated treatments; therefore, this setting is likely to be an environment in which cognitive augmentation of the clinician's provision of care with technology rooted in artificial intelligence, such as machine learning (ML), is likely to eventuate., SOURCES OF DATA: PubMed and Google Scholar with search terms that included ML, intensive/critical care unit, electronic health records (EHR), anesthesia information management systems and clinical decision support were the primary sources for this report., AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Different categories of learning of large clinical datasets, often contained in EHRs, are used for training in ML. Supervised learning uses algorithm-based models, including support vector machines, to pair patients' attributes with an expected outcome. Unsupervised learning uses clustering algorithms to define to which disease grouping a patient's attributes most closely approximates. Reinforcement learning algorithms use ongoing environmental feedback to deterministically pursue likely patient outcome., AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Application of ML can result in undesirable outcomes over concerns related to fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability. Whether these ML technologies irrevocably change the healthcare workforce remains unresolved., GROWING POINTS: Well-resourced Learning Health Systems are likely to exploit ML technology to gain the fullest benefits for their patients. How these clinical advantages can be extended to patients in health systems that are neither well-endowed, nor have the necessary data gathering technologies, needs to be urgently addressed to avoid further disparities in healthcare.

Objective:                This mixed methods pilot study aimed to explore postgraduate clinical psychology students' familiarity and formal exposure to topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) during their studies.                                            Methods:                In April-June 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey using a convenience sample of 120 clinical psychology students enrolled in a two-year Masters' program at a Swiss University.                                            Results:                In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31\%). Among respondents, 73\% (                n                = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97\% reported that they had heard of the term “machine learning.” Students estimated 0.52\% of their program would be spent on AI/ML education. Around half (46\%) reported that they intended to learn about AI/ML as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students “moderately agreed” (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues.                                            Conclusions:                This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how AI/ML-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy. The survey raises questions about how curricula could be enhanced to educate clinical psychology/psychotherapy trainees about the scope of AI/ML in mental healthcare.}

Our survey of the current and planned future expenditures for diagnostics used in field service clearly indicates that the overall service diagnostics market is currently sizable, in the range of \$2 billion as of 1997, and is projected to grow to approximately \$2.6 billion by 2000. This current expenditure and growth will occur primarily in the electronics arena, but there are still substantial development and application investments occurring in both electromechanical and mechanical areas. We believe that the pace of investment will fall off as the service industry shifts from development and experimental research to the application and rollout of standard off-the-shelf technology. Thus, the overall pattern of the diagnostics market indicates a continuing increase in expenditures by the field service industry for electronics-oriented service diagnostics and some increase with respect to use of this technology in electromechanical and mechanical applications. The application and use of diagnostics technology will also be affected by the ability of the field service management community to recognize the need to search for an optimum as opposed to a feasible solution to dispatch, assignment, call screening, call avoidance, and logistics deployment. The further rollout of affordable wireless communications technology such as Ardis and Ram mobile and the new cellular- based CPDP technology, coupled with the increased availability of inexpensive wireless-based laptops, portables, and CD-ROM-based terminals will provide the service engineer in the field with an array of powerful tools for diagnostics and repair. This ability to augment the diagnostics capability of the service engineer in the field, coupled with the centralized application of artificial intelligence-based remote diagnostics for help desk and TAC support, which build on and make use of an increasing array of data collected within the integrated field service management system, could result in a significant improvement in the positive impact of problem resolution and diagnostics technology in field service (Figure 10). The new integrated field service management systems provide the basis for automatically collecting problem and symptom data and relating them to cause and corrective action information. As the availability of accurate, reliable, and maintainable repair data increases to meet the data requirements of the diagnostics technology, the scene will be set for further significant improvements in the application and use of diagnostic technology in the field service industry in the 21st century (Figure 11). Cost justification of advanced problem resolution and diagnostics technology clearly shows the value of this technology in improving service productivity, efficiency, and profitability. As we move from very expensive academically and research and development- oriented diagnostics applications to the purchase and use of off-the-shelf software and predeveloped knowledge bases, it is clear that this technology will be broadly applied.},

In particular, the corona-pandemic have spur growth in the use and implementation of digital technologies in the clinical context. This session aims to give an overview of aspects and recent developments of digitalization in palliative care. Method(s): Overview on selected publications, outlook, and discussion Results: Digital interventions range from electronic medial health records (EMR), applications (APPs), software agents (BOTs), computerized decision support systems (CCDSS), wearables, virtual reality and augmented reality. Digital approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) can help to determine the need to involve palliative care, or to identify patients with high symptom burden or poor prognosis. (Identification). During in- or outpatient treatment, digital assessments are used. After discharge from palliative care wards, Smartphone applications (apps) and wearables are investigated to prevent emergency re-hospitalizations or to strengthen outpatient care. (Monitoring) Psychosocial and spiritual care turns digital. Mobile apps can be used in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of depression and gain importance in spiritual care. Virtual Reality is considered to be a promising intervention in bedbound patients. (Therapy). Digital communication allows isolated patients to communicate with their loved ones during the pandemic. Furthermore, digital approaches are tested to support decision making at the end of life (communication; information sharing and shared-decision making). During the last year, digital technologies have transformed education: teaching and training in palliative care has become almost entirely digital (Education). Conclusion(s): Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats need to be considered. Approaches in favor of patient care are warranted. A guideline by the WHO on how digital interventions can actually be applied in the interests of patients will be discussed.},

  abstract = {There are both formal and informal cries that UTAUT and by association the stream of research on technology adoption has reached its limit, with little or no opportunities for new knowledge creation. Such a conclusion is ironic because the theory has not been sufficiently and suitably replicated. It is possible that the misspecifications in the various replications, applications, and extensions led to the incorrect conclusion that UTAUT was more robust than it really was and opportunities for future work were limited. Although work on UTAUT has included important variables, predictors and moderators, absent a faithful use of the original specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature of the effects of the original and additional variables. The present meta-analysis uses 25,619 effect sizes reported by 737,112 users in 1,935 independent samples to address this issue. Consequently, we develop a clear current state-of-the-art and revised UTAUT that extends the original theory with new endogenous mechanisms from different, other theories (i.e., technology compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, and costs of technology) and new moderating mechanisms to examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different contexts (e.g., technology type and national culture). Based on this revised UTAUT, we present a research agenda that can guide future research on the topic of technology adoption in general and UTAUT in particular.},

Blockchain technology has been suggested as one possible critical solution to overcome the current barriers of implementing the circular economy concept. This article addresses the nascent research field of blockchain for a circular economy and examines current developments, from both research and practice. By developing and conducting a research-practice gap analysis using a systematic literature review, this article identifies patterns of interests and opportunities for research and practice and uncovers mutual blind spots that need to be addressed in either sphere. A systematic literature review and qualitative analysis covering 57 diverse documents (journal articles, contents linked from twitter, and google results) revealed three key findings: 1) a clear terminology of blockchain types, their technical properties and benefits are lacking in research, 2) trust and verification are major potential benefits but a challenge to create, and 3) a closer examination of possible benefits and challenges of blockchain technologies for the circular economy with its links to sustainable development is crucial.},

  abstract = {Objectives To develop predictive models for blood culture (BC) outcomes in an emergency department (ED) setting. Design Retrospective observational study. Setting ED of a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands between 1 September 2018 and 24 June 2020. Participants Adult patients from whom BCs were collected in the ED. Data of demographic information, vital signs, administered medications in the ED and laboratory and radiology results were extracted from the electronic health record, if available at the end of the ED visits. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the performance of two models (logistic regression and gradient boosted trees) to predict bacteraemia in ED patients, defined as at least one true positive BC collected at the ED. Results In 4885 out of 51 399 ED visits (9.5\%), BCs were collected. In 598/4885 (12.2\%) visits, at least one of the BCs was true positive. Both a gradient boosted tree model and a logistic regression model showed good performance in predicting BC results with area under curve of the receiver operating characteristics of 0.77 (95\% CI 0.73 to 0.82) and 0.78 (95\% CI 0.73 to 0.82) in the test sets, respectively. In the gradient boosted tree model, the optimal threshold would predict 69\% of BCs in the test set to be negative, with a negative predictive value of over 94\%. Conclusions Both models can accurately identify patients with low risk of bacteraemia at the ED in this single-centre setting and may be useful to reduce unnecessary BCs and associated healthcare costs. Further studies are necessary for validation and to investigate the potential clinical benefits and possible risks after implementation.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: eHealth promises to increase self-management and personalised medicine and improve cost-effectiveness in primary care. Paired with these promises are ethical implications, as eHealth will affect patients' and primary care professionals' (PCPs) experiences, values, norms, and relationships. Objectives: We argue what ethical implications related to the impact of eHealth on four vital aspects of primary care could (and should) be anticipated. Discussion: (1) EHealth influences dealing with predictive and diagnostic uncertainty. Machine-learning based clinical decision support systems offer (seemingly) objective, quantified, and personalised outcomes. However, they also introduce new loci of uncertainty and subjectivity. The decision-making process becomes opaque, and algorithms can be invalid, biased, or even discriminatory. This has implications for professional responsibilities and judgments, justice, autonomy, and trust. (2) EHealth affects the roles and responsibilities of patients because it can stimulate self-management and autonomy. However, autonomy can also be compromised, e.g. in cases of persuasive technologies and eHealth can increase existing health disparities. (3) The delegation of tasks to a network of technologies and stakeholders requires attention for responsibility gaps and new responsibilities. (4) The triangulate relationship: patient-eHealth-PCP requires a reconsideration of the role of human interaction and 'humanness' in primary care as well as of shaping Shared Decision Making. Conclusion:  Our analysis is an essential first step towards setting up a dedicated ethics research agenda that should be examined in parallel to the development and implementation of eHealth. The ultimate goal is to inspire the development of practice-specific ethical recommendations.},

In this work, we fastidiously utilize ML to derive autism spectrum disorder (ASD) instrument algorithms in an attempt to improve upon widely used ASD screening and diagnostic tools. Methods The data consisted of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores for 1,264 verbal individuals with ASD and 462 verbal individuals with non-ASD developmental or psychiatric disorders, split at age 10. Algorithms were created via a robust ML classifier, support vector machine, while targeting best-estimate clinical diagnosis of ASD versus non-ASD. Parameter settings were tuned in multiple levels of cross-validation. Results The created algorithms were more effective (higher performing) than the current algorithms, were tunable (sensitivity and specificity can be differentially weighted), and were more efficient (achieving near-peak performance with five or fewer codes). Results from ML-based fusion of ADI-R and SRS are reported. We present a screener algorithm for below (above) age 10 that reached 89.2\% (86.7\%) sensitivity and 59.0\% (53.4\%) specificity with only five behavioral codes. Conclusions ML is useful for creating robust, customizable instrument algorithms. In a unique dataset comprised of controls with other difficulties, our findings highlight the limitations of current caregiver-report instruments and indicate possible avenues for improving ASD screening and diagnostic tools.},

  abstract = {Background Common mental disorders can be effectively treated with psychotherapy, but some patients do not respond well and require timely identification to prevent treatment failure. We aimed to develop and validate a dynamic model to predict psychological treatment outcomes, and to compare the model with currently used methods, including expected treatment response models and machine learning models. Methods In this prediction model development and validation study, we obtained data from two UK studies including patients who had accessed therapy via Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services managed by ten UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts between March, 2012, and June, 2018, to predict treatment outcomes. In study 1, we used data on patient-reported depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 [GAD-7]) symptom measures obtained on a session-by-session basis (Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust dataset; n=2317) to train the Oracle dynamic prediction model using iterative logistic regression analysis. The outcome of interest was reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed in an external test sample (Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust dataset; n=2036) using the area under the curve (AUC), positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs). In study 2, we retrained the Oracle algorithm using a multiservice sample (South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; n=42\hphantom{,}992) and compared its performance with an expected treatment response model and five machine learning models (Bayesian updating algorithm, elastic net regularisation, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, and neural networks based on a multilayer perceptron algorithm) in an external test sample (Whittington Health NHS Trust; Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust; Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust; and Humber NHS Foundation Trust; n=30\hphantom{,}026). Findings The Oracle algorithm trained using iterative logistic regressions generalised well to external test samples, explaining up to 47·3\% of variability in treatment outcomes. Prediction accuracy was modest at session one (AUC 0·59 [95\% CI 0·55–0·62], PPV 0·63, NPV 0·61), but improved over time, reaching high prediction accuracy (AUC 0·81 [0·77–0·86], PPV 0·79, NPV 0·69) as early as session seven. The performance of the Oracle model was similar to complex (eg, including patient profiling variables) and computationally intensive machine learning models (eg, neural networks based on a multilayer perceptron algorithm, extreme gradient boosting). Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of a more simple dynamic algorithm including only baseline and index-session scores was comparable to more complex algorithms that included additional predictors modelling sample-level and individual-level variability. Overall, the Oracle algorithm significantly outperformed the expected treatment response model (mean AUC 0·80 vs 0·70, p{$<$}0·0001]). Interpretation Dynamic prediction models using sparse and readily available symptom measures are capable of predicting psychotherapy outcomes with high accuracy. Funding University of Sheffield.},

  abstract = {Purpose: While evidence indicates that Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) may promote colorectal carcinogenesis through its suppressive effect on T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity, the specific T-cell subsets involved remain uncertain. Experimental Design: We measured F. nucleatum DNA within tumor tissue by quantitative PCR on 933 cases (including 128 F. nucleatum-positive cases) among 4,465 incident colorectal carcinoma cases in two prospective cohorts. Multiplex immunofluorescence combined with digital image analysis and machine learning algorithms for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO (PTPRC isoform), and FOXP3 measured various T-cell subsets. We leveraged data on Bifidobacterium, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor whole-exome sequencing, and M1/M2-type tumor-associated macrophages [TAM; by CD68, CD86, IRF5, MAF, and MRC1 (CD206) multimarker assay]. Using the 4,465 cancer cases and inverse probability weighting method to control for selection bias due to tissue availability, multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis assessed the association between F. nucleatum and T-cell subsets. Results: The amount of F. nucleatum was inversely associated with tumor stromal CD3(+) lymphocytes [multivariable OR, 0.47; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.79, for F. nucleatum-high vs. -negative category; P-trend = 0.0004] and specifically stromal CD3(+) CD4(+) CD45RO(+) cells (corresponding multivariable OR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.85; P-trend = 0.003). These relationships did not substantially differ by MSI status, neoantigen load, or exome-wide tumor mutational burden. F. nucleatum was not significantly associated with tumor intraepithelial T cells or with M1 or M2 TAMs. Conclusions: The amount of tissue F. nucleatum is associated with lower density of stromal memory helper T cells. Our findings provide evidence for the interactive pathogenic roles of microbiota and specific immune cells.},

The relatively high comorbidity between autism and all epilepsy syndromes suggests the possibility of common underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Although many different epilepsies may be comorbid with autism, absence epilepsy is a generalized epilepsy syndrome with seizures that appear as staring spells, with no motor signs and no focal lesions, making it more difficult to diagnose. Application of nonlinear methods for EEG signal analysis may enable characterization of brain activity that can help to delineate neurophysiological commonalities and differences between autism and epilepsy. Multiscale entropy and recurrence quantitative analysis (RQA) were computed from EEG signals derived from children with autism or absence epilepsy and compared with the goal of finding significant and potentially clinically useful biomarkers neurophysiological differences between these two childhood disorders.},

  abstract = {In machine learning, estimation of predictive accuracy for a given model is most commonly approached by analyzing the average accuracy of the model. In general, the predictive models do not provide reliability estimates for their individual predictions. The reliability estimates of individual predictions require the analysis of specific model and instance properties. Measuring the prediction reliability is very important in risk-sensitive areas where acting upon predictions may have significant consequences (e.g. medical diagnosis, stock market, navigation, control applications). In such areas, appropriate reliability estimates may provide additional information about the prediction correctness and can enable the user (e.g. medical doctor) to differentiate between more and less reliable predictions. This chapter summarizes research areas, which provide the motivating ideas for the development of the approaches for individual prediction reliability. Based on these motivations, we describe five approaches to reliability estimation (i.e., local sensitivity analysis, bagging variance, local cross-validation, density estimation, local error modeling) and define the corresponding reliability estimates. The empirical evaluation of eight estimates using 28 testing domains and 8 regression models indicated the promising results, especially for the usage with regression trees. The testing results also reveal that the reliability estimates exhibit different performance with different regression models and domains. To deal with this issue, we describe two approaches for automatic selection of the most appropriate estimate for a given domain and regression model: (i) the meta-learning approach and (ii) the internal cross-validation approach. The empirical results of both approaches show the advantage of the dynamically selected reliability estimate for a given domain/model pair, when compared to individual reliability estimates in terms of higher positive correlation to the prediction error.

  abstract = {Purpose Job demands can contribute to nurses’ turnover intention and this can have an impact on health services among the general population. It appears important to identify the work environment factors associated with turnover intention, as well as the psychological resources liable to act on this relationship. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), the purpose of this study (n=1179) is to investigate the relationship between two job demands (role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of basic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness) within these relationships. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses (Québec, Canada). Nurses completed an online questionnaire. To test the proposed moderating effect of satisfaction of the three psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness) in the relationship between job demands (i.e. role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, path analysis was conducted using Mplus v.8 (Muthén and Muthen, 2017). Two models, one for each demand, were tested. Findings As expected, role ambiguity and role conflict are positively related to turnover intention. Results reveal a significant interaction between role ambiguity and satisfaction of the need for autonomy in the prediction of turnover intention. The satisfaction of the need for competence and the satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for autonomy moderated the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Moreover, results revealed a significant interaction between role conflict and satisfaction of the need for competence in the prediction of turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications The results align with the theoretical propositions of several leading theories in occupational health which state that workers’ psychological functioning derives not only from the job characteristics of their work environment, but also from the psychological resources at their disposal. The study contributes to SDT. First, to date, this is the first study to investigate basic psychological need satisfaction as a moderator in the relationship between contextual factors and workers’ functioning. Second, the findings revealed the importance of assessing psychological needs separately, as each contributes in a specific way to workers’ work-related attitudes and adaptation to their professional environment. Practical implications Perceptions of autonomy and competence act as key psychological resources for nurses. Managerial support for autonomy (e.g. providing nurses with meaningful information regarding their work) and competence (e.g. providing nurses with frequent positive feedback regarding their work efforts) constitutes a series of key management practices that can foster perceptions of autonomy and competence. The findings show that two role stressors predict nurses’ turnover intention. As such, health care establishments are encouraged to focus on interventions that reduce uncertainties and conflicting situations from nurses (provide clear job descriptions and effective communication). Social implications By promoting a sense of effectiveness and feelings of self-endorsement at work, health care establishments can reduce nurses’ turnover intention and help prevent staffing shortages among this important work group. Originality/value Although past research shows that workers’ motivational profile can modulate the relationship between characteristics within the work environment and workers’ functioning, studying the quality of work motivation is not sufficient to completely understand the factors that can influence workers’ reactions to job demands. Need satisfaction is crucial to the development and maintenance of high quality motivation. Evaluating need satisfaction as a moderator in the stressor–strain relationship could offer a better understanding of the psychological experiences that can promote workers’ adaptation to their work environment. To date, no study has investigated the buffering role of psychological needs in the stressor–strain relationship.},

The current version of GLIF (GLIF3) is a substantial update and enhancement of the model since the previous version (GLIF2). GLIF3 enables encoding of a guideline at three levels: a conceptual flowchart, a computable specification that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable specification that is intended to be incorporated into particular institutional information systems. The representation has been tested on a wide variety of guidelines that are typical of the range of guidelines in clinical use. It builds upon GLIF2 by adding several constructs that enable interpretation of encoded guidelines in computer-based decision-support systems. GLIF3 leverages standards being developed in Health Level 7 in order to allow integration of guidelines with clinical information systems. The GLIF3 specification consists of an extensible object-oriented model and a structured syntax based on the resource description framework (RDF). Empirical validation of the ability to generate appropriate recommendations using GLIF3 has been tested by executing encoded guidelines against actual patient data. GLIF3 is accordingly ready for broader experimentation and prototype use by organizations that wish to evaluate its ability to capture the logic of clinical guidelines, to implement them in clinical systems, and thereby to provide integrated decision support to assist clinicians.},

The complexity of electronic health records overwhelms physicians' abilities to use the information for optimal and timely preoperative risk assessment. We hypothesized that data-driven, predictive-risk algorithms implemented in an intelligent decision-support platform simplify and augment physicians' risk assessments., METHODS: This prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 20 physicians at a quaternary academic medical center compared the usability and accuracy of preoperative risk assessment between physicians and MySurgeryRisk, a validated, machine-learning algorithm, using a simulated workflow for the real-time, intelligent decision-support platform. We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the accuracy of physicians' risk assessment for six postoperative complications before and after interaction with the algorithm for 150 clinical cases., RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was significantly better than physicians' initial risk assessments (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.47 and 0.69) for all postoperative complications except cardiovascular. After interaction with the algorithm, the physicians significantly improved their risk assessment for acute kidney injury and for an intensive care unit admission greater than 48 hours, resulting in a net improvement of reclassification of 12\% and 16\%, respectively. Physicians rated the algorithm as easy to use and useful., CONCLUSION: Implementation of a validated, MySurgeryRisk computational algorithm for real-time predictive analytics with data derived from the electronic health records to augment physicians' decision-making is feasible and accepted by physicians. Early involvement of physicians as key stakeholders in both design and implementation of this technology will be crucial for its future success. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep 3D convolutional encoder networks with shortcut connections and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network that consists of two interconnected pathways, a convolutional pathway, which learns increasingly more abstract and higher-level image features, and a deconvolutional pathway, which predicts the final segmentation at the voxel level. The joint training of the feature extraction and prediction pathways allows for the automatic learning of features at different scales that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of image types and segmentation task. In addition, shortcut connections between the two pathways allow high- and low-level features to be integrated, which enables the segmentation of lesions across a wide range of sizes. We have evaluated our method on two publicly available data sets (MICCAI 2008 and ISBI 2015 challenges) with the results showing that our method performs comparably to the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods, even when only relatively small data sets are available for training. In addition, we have compared our method with five freely available and widely used MS lesion segmentation methods (EMS, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, Lesion-TOADS, and SLS) on a large data set from an MS clinical trial. The results show that our method consistently outperforms these other methods across a wide range of lesion sizes.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinician perceptions of suicide risk flags.Methods: Participants (n = 139; 68 with complete data) were mental health clinicians recruited to complete online surveys from October 2018 to April 2019.Results: Most participants preferred to know which features resulted in a patient receiving a suicide flag (94.12\%) and reported that knowing those features would influence their treatment (88.24\%). Clinicians were more likely to report that some algorithm features (increased thoughts of suicide) would alter their clinical decisions more than others (age, physical health conditions; χ2 = 270.84, P {$<$} .001). Clinicians were more likely to report that they would create a safety/crisis response plan in response to a suicide risk flag compared to other interventions (χ2 = 227.02, P {$<$} .001), and 21\% reported that they would complete a no-suicide contract following a suicide risk flag.Conclusions: Clinicians overwhelmingly reported that suicide risk flags in electronic medical records would alter their clinical decision making. However, clinicians†likelihood of acting in response to a suicide risk flag was tied to which features were highlighted rather than the presence of the risk flag alone. Thus, the utility of a suicide risk algorithm will be reduced if clinical features underlying the algorithm are hidden from clinicians or if clinicians do not view the clinical features as intuitively meaningful predictors of suicide risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) care for a large number of patients with various diseases in very short timeframes under high uncertainty. Thus, systems enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) are promising and time-saving solutions that may increase the quality of care., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand GPs' attitudes toward AI-enabled systems in medical diagnosis., METHODS: We interviewed 18 GPs from Germany between March 2020 and May 2020 to identify determinants of GPs' attitudes toward AI-based systems in diagnosis. By analyzing the interview transcripts, we identified 307 open codes, which we then further structured to derive relevant attitude determinants., RESULTS: We merged the open codes into 21 concepts and finally into five categories: concerns, expectations, environmental influences, individual characteristics, and minimum requirements of AI-enabled systems. Concerns included all doubts and fears of the participants regarding AI-enabled systems. Expectations reflected GPs' thoughts and beliefs about expected benefits and limitations of AI-enabled systems in terms of GP care. Environmental influences included influences resulting from an evolving working environment, key stakeholders' perspectives and opinions, the available information technology hardware and software resources, and the media environment. Individual characteristics were determinants that describe a physician as a person, including character traits, demographic characteristics, and knowledge. In addition, the interviews also revealed the minimum requirements of AI-enabled systems, which were preconditions that must be met for GPs to contemplate using AI-enabled systems. Moreover, we identified relationships among these categories, which we conflate in our proposed model., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a thorough understanding of the perspective of future users of AI-enabled systems in primary care and lays the foundation for successful market penetration. We contribute to the research stream of analyzing and designing AI-enabled systems and the literature on attitudes toward technology and practice by fostering the understanding of GPs and their attitudes toward such systems. Our findings provide relevant information to technology developers, policymakers, and stakeholder institutions of GP care.

The use of bioinformatics platforms to handle the massive amounts of data coming from next generation sequencing and offer decision support to clinicians is critical to appropriately managing patients. The molecular profiling of cancers, particularly in the relapsed and refractory setting, is necessary for the triage decision of the two promising trends in treatment, either identifying an actionable mutation or the biomarkers predicting success with immunotherapy. In addition, this data is proving to be valuable in the area of clinical trial matching for patients and in discovering resistance patterns to various therapies. AI is now playing a greater role in early diagnosis, including its implementation into imaging fields such as mammography. The use of natural language processing is aiding in the detection of cancers from incidental lung nodules from routine imaging and in interpreting pathology reports for greater efficiencies with nurse navigation and cancer registry work. Investments in rapidly changing technology, hiring the necessary expertise, and implementing across diverse systems are just of some the challenges faced by healthcare systems.Copyright © 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology},

Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.},

  abstract = {Diabetes care is largely dependent on patient self-management and empowerment, given that patients with diabetes must make numerous daily decisions as to what to eat, when to exercise, and determine their insulin dose and timing if required. In addition, patients and providers are generating vast amounts of data from many sources, including electronic medical records, insulin pumps, sensors, glucometers, and other wearables, as well as evolving genomic, proteomic, metabolomics, and microbiomic data. Multiple digital tools and apps have been developed to assist patients to choose wisely, and to enhance their compliance by using motivational tools and incorporating incentives from social media and gaming techniques. Healthcare teams (HCTs) and health administrators benefit from digital developments that sift through the enormous amounts of patient-generated data. Data are acquired, integrated, analyzed, and presented in a self-explanatory manner, highlighting important trends and items that require attention. The use of decision support systems may propose data-driven actions that, for the most, require final approval by the patient or physician before execution and, once implemented, may improve patient outcomes. The digital diabetes clinic aims to incorporate all digital patient data and provide individually tailored virtual or face-to-face visits to those persons who need them most. Digital diabetes care has demonstrated only modest HbA1c reduction in multiple studies and borderline cost-effectiveness, although patient satisfaction appears to be increased. Better understanding of the barriers to digital diabetes care and identification of unmet needs may yield improved utilization of this evolving technology in a safe, effective, and cost-saving manner.Copyright © 2017 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley \& Sons Australia, Ltd},

  abstract = {In this work we implement a COVID-19 infection detection system based on chest X-ray images with uncertainty estimation. Uncertainty estimation is vital for safe usage of computer aided diagnosis tools in medical applications. Model estimations with high uncertainty should be carefully analyzed by a trained radiologist. We aim to improve uncertainty estimations using unlabelled data through the MixMatch semi-supervised framework. We test popular uncertainty estimation approaches, comprising Softmax scores, Monte-Carlo dropout and deterministic uncertainty quantification. To compare the reliability of the uncertainty estimates, we propose the usage of the Jensen-Shannon distance between the uncertainty distributions of correct and incorrect estimations. This metric is statistically relevant, unlike most previously used metrics, which often ignore the distribution of the uncertainty estimations. Our test results show a significant improvement in uncertainty estimates when using unlabelled data. The best results are obtained with the use of the Monte Carlo dropout method.},

  abstract = {Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale(1-3). Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter(4); identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation(5,6); analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution(7); describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity(8,9); and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes(8,10-18).},

In Motivational Interviewing (MI), a treatment that directs the therapist to utilize a particular linguistic style, proficiency is assessed via behavioral coding-a time consuming, nontechnological approach. Natural language processing techniques have the potential to scale up the evaluation of behavioral treatments such as MI. We present a novel computational approach to assessing components of MI, focusing on 1 specific counselor behavior-reflections, which are believed to be a critical MI ingredient. Using 57 sessions from 3 MI clinical trials, we automatically detected counselor reflections in a maximum entropy Markov modeling framework using the raw linguistic data derived from session transcripts. We achieved 93\% recall, 90\% specificity, and 73\% precision. Results provide insight into the linguistic information used by coders to make ratings and demonstrate the feasibility of new computational approaches to scaling up the evaluation of behavioral treatments.},

After the emergence of wearable devices that could be part of our lives, researchers have started detecting extreme stress of individuals with them during daily routines. Initial experiments were performed in laboratory environments and recently a number of works took a step outside the laboratory environment to the real-life. We developed an automatic stress detection system using physiological signals obtained from unobtrusive smart wearable devices which can be carried during the daily life routines of individuals. This system has modality-specific artifact removal and feature extraction methods for real-life conditions. We further tested our system in a real-life setting with collected physiological data from 21 participants of an algorithmic programming contest for nine days. This event had lectures, contests as well as free time. By using heart activity, skin conductance and accelerometer signals, we successfully discriminated contest stress, relatively higher cognitive load (lecture) and relaxed time activities by using different machine learning methods.},

Society may have significant benefits from an automatic daily life stress detection system using unobtrusive wearable devices using physiological signals. However, the performance of these systems is not sufficiently accurate when they are used in unrestricted daily life compared to the systems tested in controlled real-life and laboratory conditions. To test our stress level detection system that preprocesses noisy physiological signals, extracts features, and applies machine learning classification techniques, we used a laboratory experiment and ecological momentary assessment based data collection with smartwatches in daily life. We investigated the effect of different labeling techniques and different training and test environments. In the laboratory environments, we had more controlled situations, and we could validate the perceived stress from self-reports. When machine learning models were trained in the laboratory instead of training them with the data coming from daily life, the accuracy of the system when tested in daily life improved significantly. The subjectivity effect coming from the self-reports in daily life could be eliminated. Our system obtained higher stress level detection accuracy results compared to most of the previous daily life studies.},

Although research has traditionally been conducted in laboratory settings, a set of new studies have recently begun to be conducted in ecological environments with unobtrusive wearable devices. Since patterns of stress are ideographic, person-independent models have generally lower accuracies. On the contrary, person-specific models have higher accuracies but they require a long-term data collection period. In this study, we developed a hybrid approach of personal level stress clustering by using baseline stress self-reports to increase the success of person-independent models without requiring a substantial amount of personal data. We further added decision level smoothing to our unobtrusive smartwatch based stress level differentiation system to increase the performance by correcting false labels assigned by the machine learning algorithm. In order to test and evaluate our system, we collected physiological data from 32 participants of a summer school with wrist-worn unobtrusive wearable devices. This event is comprised of baseline, lecture, exam and recovery sessions. In the recovery session, a stress management method was applied to alleviate the stress of the participants. The perceived stress in the form of NASA-TLX questionnaires collected from the users as self-reports and physiological stress levels extracted using wearable sensors are examined separately. By using our system, we were able to differentiate the 3-levels of stress successfully. We further substantially increase our performance by personal stress level clustering and by applying high-level accuracy calculation and decision level smoothing methods. We also demonstrated the success of the stress reduction methods by analyzing physiological signals and self-reports.},

Using data from 374 WeChat senior respondents, the integrated model was developed based on expectation-confirmation model of information system continuance, perceived ease of use, emotional attachment and related explanatory variables, and validated in the Chinese context. The results indicated that: (1) Satisfaction and emotional attachment play partly and full mediator role between the perceived usefulness, confirmation of expectation, perceived ease of use and continuance intention. In addition, perceived usefulness is directly positively associated with continuance intention; (2) Emotional attachment has the largest association with continuance intention in all the factors; (3) Satisfaction, relatedness need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction are positively associated with emotional attachment, and the relatedness need satisfaction has the strongest association among these three factors; (4) Unexpectedly, autonomy need satisfaction has no significant association with emotional attachment and the effect of declining physiological conditions has no significant association with perceived ease of use. This research enriches the existing work by explaining the underlying cognitive-affective-conative process of seniors' MSNS continuance using. It also provides guidance to keep the loyalty of senior users for MSNS practitioners.},

In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in research concerning ANNs in gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This state-of-the-art technique exhibits excellent performance in diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and treatment. Competitions between ANNs and GI experts suggest that efficiency and accuracy might be compatible in virtue of technique advancements. However, the shortcomings of ANNs are not negligible and may induce alterations in many aspects of medical practice. In this review, we introduce basic knowledge about ANNs and summarize the current achievements of ANNs in GI diseases from the perspective of gastroenterologists. Existing limitations and future directions are also proposed to optimize ANN's clinical potential. In consideration of barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge, sophisticated concepts are discussed using plain words and metaphors to make this review more easily understood by medical practitioners and the general public.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract = {Early childhood anxiety disorders are common, impairing, and predictive of anxiety and mood disorders later in childhood. Epidemiological studies over the last decade find that the prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders in preschool children ranges from 0.3\% to 6.5\%. Yet, less than 15\% of young children with an impairing anxiety disorder receive a mental health evaluation or treatment. One possible reason for the low rate of care for anxious preschoolers is the lack of affordable, timely, reliable and valid tools for identifying young children with clinically significant anxiety. Diagnostic interviews assessing psychopathology in young children require intensive training, take hours to administer and code, and are not available for use outside of research settings. The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is a reliable and valid structured diagnostic parent-report interview for assessing psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, in 2 to 5 year old children. In this paper, we apply machine-learning tools to already collected PAPA data from two large community studies to identify sub-sets of PAPA items that could be developed into an efficient, reliable, and valid screening tool to assess a young child’s risk for an anxiety disorder. Using machine learning, we were able to decrease by an order of magnitude the number of items needed to identify a child who is at risk for an anxiety disorder with an accuracy of over 96\% for both generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Additionally, rather than considering GAD or SAD as discrete/binary entities, we present a continuous risk score representing the child’s risk of meeting criteria for GAD or SAD. Identification of a short question-set that assesses risk for an anxiety disorder could be a first step toward development and validation of a relatively short screening tool feasible for use in pediatric clinics and daycare/preschool settings.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer care is a leading area for development of artificial intelligence (AI), with applications including screening and diagnosis, risk calculation, prognostication and clinical decision-support, management planning, and precision medicine. We review the ethical, legal and social implications of these developments. We consider the values encoded in algorithms, the need to evaluate outcomes, and issues of bias and transferability, data ownership, confidentiality and consent, and legal, moral and professional responsibility. We consider potential effects for patients, including on trust in healthcare, and provide some social science explanations for the apparent rush to implement AI solutions. We conclude by anticipating future directions for AI in breast cancer care. Stakeholders in healthcare AI should acknowledge that their enterprise is an ethical, legal and social challenge, not just a technical challenge. Taking these challenges seriously will require broad engagement, imposition of conditions on implementation, and pre-emptive systems of oversight to ensure that development does not run ahead of evaluation and deliberation. Once artificial intelligence becomes institutionalised, it may be difficult to reverse: a proactive role for government, regulators and professional groups will help ensure introduction in robust research contexts, and the development of a sound evidence base regarding real-world effectiveness. Detailed public discussion is required to consider what kind of AI is acceptable rather than simply accepting what is offered, thus optimising outcomes for health systems, professionals, society and those receiving care.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to healthcare promise to solve many of the existing global issues in advancing human health and managing global health challenges. This comprehensive review aims not only to surface the underlying ethical and legal but also social implications (ELSI) that have been overlooked in recent reviews while deserving equal attention in the development stage, and certainly ahead of implementation in healthcare. It is intended to guide various stakeholders (eg. designers, engineers, clinicians) in addressing the ELSI of AI at the design stage using the Ethics by Design (EbD) approach., METHODS: The authors followed a systematised scoping methodology and searched the following databases: Pubmed, Web of science, Ovid, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO Search (Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, APA PsycArticles, ERIC) for the ELSI of AI in healthcare through January 2021. Data were charted and synthesised, and the authors conducted a descriptive and thematic analysis of the collected data., RESULTS: After reviewing 1108 papers, 94 were included in the final analysis. Our results show a growing interest in the academic community for ELSI in the field of AI. The main issues of concern identified in our analysis fall into four main clusters of impact: AI algorithms, physicians, patients, and healthcare in general. The most prevalent issues are patient safety, algorithmic transparency, lack of proper regulation, liability \& accountability, impact on patient-physician relationship and governance of AI empowered healthcare., CONCLUSIONS: The results of our review confirm the potential of AI to significantly improve patient care, but the drawbacks to its implementation relate to complex ELSI that have yet to be addressed. Most ELSI refer to the impact on and extension of the reciprocal and fiduciary patient-physician relationship. With the integration of AIbased decision making tools, a bilateral patient-physician relationship may shift into a trilateral one. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is currently one of the main causes of death and tumoral diseases in women. Even if early diagnosis processes have evolved in the last years thanks to the popularization of mammogram tests, nowadays, it is still a challenge to have available reliable diagnosis systems that are exempt of variability in their interpretation. To this end, in this work, the design and development of an intelligent clinical decision support system to be used in the preventive diagnosis of breast cancer is presented, aiming both to improve the accuracy in the evaluation and to reduce its uncertainty. Through the integration of expert systems (based on Mamdani-type fuzzy-logic inference engines) deployed in cascade, exploratory factorial analysis, data augmentation approaches, and classification algorithms such as k-neighbors and bagged trees, the system is able to learn and to interpret the patient's medical-healthcare data, generating an alert level associated to the danger she has of suffering from cancer. For the system's initial performance tests, a software implementation of it has been built that was used in the diagnosis of a series of patients contained into a 130-cases database provided by the School of Medicine and Public Health of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which has been also used to create the knowledge base. The obtained results, characterized as areas under the ROC curves of 0.95-0.97 and high success rates, highlight the huge diagnosis and preventive potential of the developed system, and they allow forecasting, even when a detailed and contrasted validation is still pending, its relevance and applicability within the clinical field.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {Objective: This paper presents Visual MRI, an innovative tool for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of tumoral tissues. The main goat of the analysis is to separate each magnetic resonance image in meaningful clusters, highlighting zones which are more probably related with the cancer evolution. Such non-invasive analysis serves to address novel cancer treatments, resulting in a less destabilizing and more effective type of therapy than the chemotherapy-based ones. The advancements brought by Visual MRI are two: first, it is an integration of effective information visualization (IV) techniques into a clustering framework, which separates each MRI image in a set of informative clusters; the second improvement relies in the clustering framework itself, which is derived from a recently re-discovered non-parametric grouping strategy, i.e., the mean shift. Methodology: The proposed methodology merges visualization methods and data mining techniques, providing a computational framework that allows the physician to move effectively from the MRI image to the images displaying the derived parameter space. An unsupervised non-parametric clustering algorithm, derived from the mean shift paradigm, and called MRI-mean shift, is the novel data mining technique proposed here. The main underlying idea of such approach is that the parameter space is regarded as an empirical probability density function to estimate: the possible separate modes and their attraction basins represent separated clusters. The mean shift algorithm needs sensibility threshold values to be set, which could Lead to highly different segmentation results. Usually, these values are set by hands. Here, with the MRI-mean shift algorithm, we propose a strategy based on a structured optimality criterion which faces effectively this issue, resulting in a completely unsupervised clustering framework. A linked brushing visualization technique is then used for representing clusters on the parameter space and on the MRI image, where physicians can observe further anatomical details. In order to allow the physician to easily use all the analysis and visualization tools, a visual interface has been designed and implemented, resulting in a computational framework susceptible of evaluation and testing by physicians. Results: Visual MRI has been adopted by physicians in a real clinical research setting. To describe the main features of the system, some examples of usage on real cases are shown, following step by step all the actions scientists can do on an MRI image. To assess the contribution of Visual MRI given to the research setting, a validation of the clustering results in a medical sense has been carried out. Conclusions: From a general point of view, the two main objectives reached in this paper are: (1) merging information visualization and data mining approaches to support clinical research and (2) proposing an effective and fully automated clustering technique. More particularly, a new application for MRI data analysis, named Visual MRI, is proposed, aiming at improving the support of medical researchers in the context of cancer therapy; moreover, a non-parametric technique for cluster analysis, named MRI-mean shift, has been drawn. The results show the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infections frequently cause prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Repeated measurements of the procalcitonin (PCT) biomarker are typically used for early detection and follow up of bacterial infections and sepsis, but those PCT measurements are costly. To avoid overutilization, we developed and evaluated a clinical decision support system (CDSS) in Arden Syntax which computes necessary and preventable PCT orders., METHODS: The CDSS implements a rule set based on the latest PCT value, the time period since this measurement, and the PCT trend scenario. We assessed the CDSS effects on the daily rate of ordered PCT tests within a prospective study having two ON and two OFF phases in a surgical ICU. In addition, we performed interviews with the participating physicians to investigate their experience with the CDSS advice., RESULTS: Prior to the deployment of the CDSS, 22\% of the performed PCT tests were potentially preventable according to the rule set. During the first ON phase the daily rate of ordered PCT tests per patient decreased significantly from 0.807 to 0.662. In subsequent OFF, ON and OFF phases, however, PCT utilization reached again daily rates of 0.733, 0.803, and 0.792, respectively. The interviews demonstrated that the physicians were aware of the problem of PCT overutilization, which they primarily attributed to acute time constraints. The responders assumed that the majority of preventable measurements are indiscriminately ordered for patients during longer ICU stays., CONCLUSION: We observed an 18\% reduction of PCT tests within the first four weeks of CDSS support in the investigated ICU. This reduction may have been influenced by raised awareness of the overutilization problem; the extent of this influence cannot be determined in our study design. No reduction of PCT tests could be observed during the second ON phase. The physician interviews indicated that time critical ICU situations can prevent extensive reflection about the necessity of individual tests. In order to achieve an enduring effect on PCT utilization, we will have to proceed to electronic order entry. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are playing an increasing role in biomedical research and healthcare services. This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context., METHODS: A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections., RESULTS: We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way., CONCLUSIONS: Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We designed a theoretical model based on the technology acceptance model to explain the acceptance of these technologies. The study was carried out on a sample of 326 technical professional students. Students are considered ideal samples to test theoretical predictions regarding the relationships between variables in emerging technologies. The results show the positive effect of technological optimism on perceived usefulness and ease of use. However, there was not a direct effect on the attitude towards the use. A mediating effect was established. In addition, the facilitating conditions influence optimism and the ease of using the technology. These elements influence the attitude and intention to use, which is consistent with previous studies on technology acceptance. The results will guide the design of public policies to incorporate technologies into education.},

With the advent of increased computational power and the ability to store and rapidly process big data sets in recent years, these physiologic data show promise in identifying specific outcomes and/or events during patients' ICU hospitalization., METHODS: We introduced a methodology designed to automatically extract information from continuous-in-time vital sign data collected from bedside monitors to predict if a patient will experience a prolonged stay (length of stay) on mechanical ventilation, defined as {$>$}4 d, in a pediatric ICU., RESULTS: Continuous-in-time vital signs information and clinical history data were retrospectively collected for 284 ICU subjects from their first 24 h on mechanical ventilation from a medical-surgical pediatric ICU at Boston Children's Hospital. Multiple machine learning models were trained on multiple subsets of these subjects to predict the likelihood that each of these subjects would experience a long stay. We evaluated the predictive power of our models strictly on unseen hold-out validation sets of subjects. Our methodology achieved model performance of {$>$}83\% (area under the curve) by using only vital sign information as input, and performances of 90\% (area under the curve) by combining vital sign information with subjects' static clinical data readily available in electronic health records. We implemented this approach on 300 independently trained experiments with different choices of training and hold-out validation sets to ensure the consistency and robustness of our results in our study sample. The predictive power of our approach outperformed recent efforts that used deep learning to predict a similar task., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed workflow may prove useful in the design of scalable approaches for real-time predictive systems in ICU environments, exploiting real-time vital sign information from bedside monitors.

This paper describes a trial implementation of the ML-based DST in the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit (QISU) workflow using a major pediatric hospital's ED data comparing outcomes in coding time and pre- and postimplementation accuracies., RESULTS: The study found a 10\% reduction in manual coding time after the DST was introduced. The Kappa statistics analysis in both DST-assisted and -unassisted data shows increase in accuracy across three data fields, that is, injury intent (85.4\% unassisted vs. 94.5\% assisted), external cause (88.8\% unassisted vs. 91.8\% assisted), and injury factor (89.3\% unassisted vs. 92.9\% assisted). The classifier was also used to produce a timely report monitoring injury patterns during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hence, it has the potential for near real-time surveillance of emerging hazards to inform public health responses., CONCLUSION: The integration of the DST into the injury surveillance workflow shows benefits as it facilitates timely reporting and acts as a DST in the manual coding process.

  abstract = {Sensor networks empower Internet of Things (IoT) applications by connecting them to physical world measurements. However, the necessary use of limited bandwidth networks and battery-powered devices makes their optimal configuration challenging. An over-usage of periodic sensors (i.e. too frequent measurements) may easily lead to network congestion or battery drain effects, and conversely, a lower usage is likely to cause poor measurement quality. In this paper we propose a middleware that continuously generates and exposes to the sensor network an energy-efficient sensors configuration based on data live observations. Using a live learning process, our contributions dynamically act on two configuration points: (i) sensors sampling frequency, which is optimized based on machine-learning predictability from previous measurements, (ii) network usage optimization according to the frequency of requests from deployed software applications. As a major outcome, we obtain a self-adaptive platform with an extended sensors battery life while ensuring a proper level of data quality and freshness. Through theoretical and experimental assessments, we demonstrate the capacity of our approach to constantly find a near-optimal tradeoff between sensors and network usage, and measurement quality. In our experimental validation, we have successfully scaled up the battery lifetime of a temperature sensor from a monthly to a yearly basis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Despite a growing body of research into both Artificial intelligence and mental health inpatient flow issues, few studies adequately combine the two. This review summarises findings in the fields of AI in psychiatry and patient flow from the past 5 years, finds links and identifies gaps for future research. Methods The OVID database was used to access Embase and Medline. Top journals such as JAMA, Nature and The Lancet were screened for other relevant studies. Selection bias was limited by strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research 3,675 papers were identified in March 2020, of which a limited number focused on AI for mental health unit patient flow. After initial screening, 323 were selected and 83 were subsequently analysed. The literature review revealed a wide range of applications with three main themes: diagnosis (33\%), prognosis (39\%) and treatment (28\%). The main themes that emerged from AI in patient flow studies were: readmissions (41\%), resource allocation (44\%) and limitations (91\%). The review extrapolates those solutions and suggests how they could potentially improve patient flow on mental health units, along with challenges and limitations they could face. Conclusion Research widely addresses potential uses of AI in mental health, with some focused on its applicability in psychiatric inpatients units, however research rarely discusses improvements in patient flow. Studies investigated various uses of AI to improve patient flow across specialities. This review highlights a gap in research and the unique research opportunity it presents.},

  abstract = {Digital technologies are considered to be an essential enabler of the circular economy in various industries. However, to date, very few studies have investigated which digital technologies could enable the circular economy in the built environment. This study specifically focuses on the built environment as one of the largest, most energy- and material-intensive industries globally, and investigates the following question: which digital technologies potentially enable a circular economy in the built environment, and in what ways? The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment. These include: (1) additive/robotic manufacturing, (2) artificial intelligence, (3) big data and analytics, (4) blockchain technology, (5) building information modelling, (6) digital platforms/marketplaces, (7) digital twins, (8) the geographical information system, (9) material passports/databanks, and (10) the internet of things. The framework provides a fruitful starting point for the novel research avenue at the intersection of circular economy, digital technology and the built environment, and gives practitioners inspiration for sustainable innovation in the sector.},

  abstract = {Background: Deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence may have different diagnostic characteristics than human experts in medical diagnosis. As a data-driven knowledge system, heterogeneous population incidence in the clinical world is considered to cause more bias to DL than clinicians. Conversely, by experiencing limited numbers of cases, human experts may exhibit large interindividual variability. Thus, understanding how the 2 groups classify given data differently is an essential step for the cooperative usage of DL in clinical application. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the differential effects of clinical experience in otoendoscopic image diagnosis in both computers and physicians exemplified by the class imbalance problem and guide clinicians when utilizing decision support systems. Methods: We used digital otoendoscopic images of patients who visited the outpatient clinic in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, from January 2013 to June 2019, for a total of 22,707 otoendoscopic images. We excluded similar images, and 7500 otoendoscopic images were selected for labeling. We built a DL-based image classification model to classify the given image into 6 disease categories. Two test sets of 300 images were populated: balanced and imbalanced test sets. We included 14 clinicians (otolaryngologists and nonotolaryngology specialists including general practitioners) and 13 DL-based models. We used accuracy (overall and per-class) and kappa statistics to compare the results of individual physicians and the ML models. Results: Our ML models had consistently high accuracies (balanced test set: mean 77.14\%, SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03\%, SD 3.06\%), equivalent to those of otolaryngologists (balanced: mean 71.17\%, SD 3.37\%; imbalanced: mean 72.84\%, SD 6.41\%) and far better than those of nonotolaryngologists (balanced: mean 45.63\%, SD 7.89\%; imbalanced: mean 44.08\%, SD 15.83\%). However, ML models suffered from class imbalance problems (balanced test set: mean 77.14\%, SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03\%, SD 3.06\%). This was mitigated by data augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes, but rare disease classes still had low per-class accuracies. Human physicians, despite being less affected by prevalence, showed high interphysician variability (ML models: kappa=0.83, SD 0.02; otolaryngologists: kappa=0.60, SD 0.07). Conclusions: Even though ML models deliver excellent performance in classifying ear disease, physicians and ML models have their own strengths. ML models have consistent and high accuracy while considering only the given image and show bias toward prevalence, whereas human physicians have varying performance but do not show bias toward prevalence and may also consider extra information that is not images. To deliver the best patient care in the shortage of otolaryngologists, our ML model can serve a cooperative role for clinicians with diverse expertise, as long as it is kept in mind that models consider only images and could be biased toward prevalent diseases even after data augmentation.},

It could be a solution to follow up with patients during their disease while saving time for health care providers. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate one year of conversations between patients with breast cancer and a chatbot. Methods: Wefight Inc designed a chatbot (Vik) to empower patients with breast cancer and their relatives. Vik responds to the fears and concerns of patients with breast cancer using personalized insights through text messages. We conducted a prospective study by analyzing the users' and patients' data, their usage duration, their interest in the various educational contents proposed, and their level of interactivity. Patients were women with breast cancer or under remission. Results: A total of 4737 patients were included. Results showed that an average of 132,970 messages exchanged per month was observed between patients and the chatbot, Vik. Thus, we calculated the average medication adherence rate over 4 weeks by using a prescription reminder function, and we showed that the more the patients used the chatbot, the more adherent they were. Patients regularly left positive comments and recommended Vik to their friends. The overall satisfaction was 93.95\% (900/958). When asked what Vik meant to them and what Vik brought them, 88.00\% (943/958) said that Vik provided them with support and helped them track their treatment effectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that it is possible to obtain support through a chatbot since Vik improved the medication adherence rate of patients with breast cancer.},

The success of deep learning in many pattern recognition applications has brought excitement and high expectations that deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), can bring revolutionary changes in health care. Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deep-learning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955, the applications of AI have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in AI in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of AI in medical education. Objective: This study aims to review the current applications of AI in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing AI in medical education. Methods: Medline (Ovid), EBSCOhost Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were subsequently pooled together and analyzed quantitatively. Results: A total of 37 articles were identified. Three primary uses of AI in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students’ learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of AI are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for AI use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of AI implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of AI in medical education and technical challenges while developing AI applications. Conclusions: The primary use of AI in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students’ learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase AI adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an AI application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of AI. To better integrate AI into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce AI into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand AI algorithms and maximize its use.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim was to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-guided clinical decision support system, to predict radiation doses to subsites of the mandible using diagnostic computed tomography scans acquired before any planning of head and neck radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: A dose classifier was trained using RT plans from 86 patients with oropharyngeal cancer; the test set consisted of an additional 20 plans. The classifier was trained to predict whether mandible subsites would receive a mean dose {$>$}50 Gy. The AI predictions were prospectively evaluated and compared with those of a specialist head and neck radiation oncologist for 9 patients. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Lin concordance correlation coefficient were calculated to compare the AI predictions to those of the physician. Result(s): In the test data set, the AI predictions had a PPV of 0.95 and NPV of 0.88. For 9 patients evaluated prospectively, there was a strong correlation between the predictions of the AI algorithm and physician (P = .72, P {$<$} .001). Comparing the AI algorithm versus the physician, the PPVs were 0.82 versus 0.25, and the NPVs were 0.94 versus 1.0, respectively. Concordance between physician estimates and final planned doses was 0.62; this was 0.71 between AI-based estimates and final planned doses. Conclusion(s): AI-guided decision support increased precision and accuracy of pre-RT dental dose estimates.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {The landscape of drug abuse is shifting. Traditional means of characterizing these changes, such as national surveys or voluntary reporting by frontline clinicians, can miss changes in usage the emergence of novel drugs. Delays in detecting novel drug usage patterns make it difficult to evaluate public policy aimed at altering drug abuse. Increasingly, newer methods to inform frontline providers to recognize symptoms associated with novel drugs or methods of administration are needed. The growth of social networks may address this need. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce tools for using data from social networks to characterize drug abuse. We outline a structured approach to analyze social media in order to capture emerging trends in drug abuse by applying powerful methods from artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling. First, we describe how to obtain data from social networks such as Twitter using publicly available automated programmatic interfaces. Then, we discuss how to use artificial intelligence techniques to extract content useful for purposes of toxicovigilance. This filtered content can be employed to generate real-time maps of drug usage across geographical regions. Beyond describing the real-time epidemiology of drug abuse, techniques from computational linguistics can uncover ways that drug discussions differ from other online conversations. Next, graph theory can elucidate the structure of networks discussing drug abuse, helping us learn what online interactions promote drug abuse and whether these interactions differ among drugs. Finally, agent-based modeling relates online interactions to psychological archetypes, providing a link between epidemiology and behavior. An analysis of social media discussions about drug abuse patterns with computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling permits the real-time monitoring and characterization of trends of drugs of abuse. These tools provide a powerful complement to existing methods of toxicovigilance.},

  abstract = {Background: Smartphone is an indispensable miracle of artificial intelligence in the hands of global netizens. Medical students overburdened and sleep-deprived due to the curricular demands can have serious health effects due to further sleep deprivation caused by problematic smartphone use, affecting their work proficiency as practicing physicians. This study aimed to evaluate the association of smartphone addiction and quality of sleep among medical students across all semesters, along with other background variables. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 224 medical students of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India using a self-administered questionnaire with four parts -Socio-demographic characteristics, General health questionnaire (GHQ-12), Smartphone addiction scale-short version (SAS-SV), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Results: The prevalence of smartphone addiction is was found out to be 33.33\% in females and 46.15\% in males. In the study, 63.39\% were poor sleepers as assessed by their PQSI scores, and 62.05\% reported poor health status as per their GHQ scores. There was a positive correlation between overall PQSI scores and smartphone use duration per day, SAS-SV scores, and GHQ scores. Conclusion: The high prevalence of excessive smartphone usage among medical students is a cause for concern and is detrimental to their health and sleep quality. The research addresses current lacunae in correlating smartphone addiction with smartphone usage before sleeping and right after waking up. Risky behavior adoption and pervasive mood changes associated with excessive smartphone use are addressed with equal representation across semesters. The study recommends increasing self-awareness for help-seeking to regulate smartphone usage and providing counseling services for students in their formative years.},

  abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although clinical decision support (CDS) alerts are effective reminders of best practices, their effectiveness is blunted by clinicians who fail to respond to an overabundance of inappropriate alerts. An electronic health record (EHR)-integrated machine learning (ML) algorithm is a potentially powerful tool to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of CDS alerts and positively impact the clinician's interaction with these alerts in general., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development and implementation of an ML-based signal-to-noise optimization system (SmartCDS) to increase the signal of alerts by decreasing the volume of low-value herpes zoster (shingles) vaccination alerts., METHODS: We built and deployed SmartCDS, which builds personalized user activity profiles to suppress shingles vaccination alerts unlikely to yield a clinician's interaction. We extracted all records of shingles alerts from January 2017 to March 2019 from our EHR system, including 327,737 encounters, 780 providers, and 144,438 patients., RESULTS: During the 6 weeks of pilot deployment, the SmartCDS system suppressed an average of 43.67\% (15,425/35,315) potential shingles alerts (appointments) and maintained stable counts of weekly shingles vaccination orders (326.3 with system active vs 331.3 in the control group; P=.38) and weekly user-alert interactions (1118.3 with system active vs 1166.3 in the control group; P=.20)., CONCLUSIONS: All key statistics remained stable while the system was turned on. Although the results are promising, the characteristics of the system can be subject to future data shifts, which require automated logging and monitoring. We demonstrated that an automated, ML-based method and data architecture to suppress alerts are feasible without detriment to overall order rates. This work is the first alert suppression ML-based model deployed in practice and serves as foundational work in encounter-level customization of alert display to maximize effectiveness.

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry. Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. Additionally, we review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We further discuss explainable AI (XAI) and causality testing in a closed-human-in-the-loop manner, and highlight the ML potential in multimedia information extraction and multimodal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research.},

Study 2 was a machine learning-based sentiment analysis in which data were captured from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website, among the most popular official, unofficial, and health-related media accounts. The screened blogs from November to December 2019 and February to March 2020 were scored by Google APIs for positivity and magnitude. Main Outcome Measures Physician-patient trust. Results Study 1 showed fear and anxiety affected changes in physician-patient trust through media usage, the indirect effect of which was 0.14 (0.03) and the 95\% CI was [0.08, 0.19]. Study 2 indicated a more positive image of physicians after the outbreak compared to before [F (2, 3537) = 3.646, p = 0.026, partial eta(2) =0.002]. Conclusion The negative impact of anxiety and fear on physician-patient trust was mediated by media use, which can be explained by the more positive media image during the pandemic.},

An evidence-practice gap continues to exist in healthcare. We contest that this gap can be reduced by assessing the use of nudge theory as part of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Deploying nudges to modify clinician behaviour and improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy represents an underused tool in bridging the evidence-practice gap. In conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) and newer devices including artificial intelligence algorithms that are increasingly integrated within learning health systems, nudges such as CDSS alerts should be iteratively tested for all stakeholders involved in health decision-making: clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. Not only could they improve the implementation of known evidence, but the true value of nudging could lie in areas where traditional randomized controlled trials are lacking, and where clinical equipoise and variation dominate. The opportunity to test CDSS nudge alerts and their ability to standardize behaviour in the face of uncertainty may generate novel insights and improve patient outcomes in areas of clinical practice currently without a robust evidence base.

We have developed wireless artificial intelligent (AI)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) sensors (AIIS) for laboratory mice motion recognition utilizing embedded microinertial measurement units (uIMUs)-a new sensing platform fills an important research gap of monitoring behaviors of many laboratory mice in parallel. We have demonstrated a wireless IoT sensor that could be attached and carried by mice (i.e., animals that typically weigh only 20 g and with body length of similar to 10 cm) and used the collected motion data to recognize five common mice behaviors (e.g., sleeping, walking, rearing, digging, and shaking) in cages with an accuracy of similar to 76\%. For comparison, current commercial video-based tracking systems that track animal behaviors in real time can reach only 70\% accuracy and with limited number of parallelly tracked animals. Furthermore, several machine learning algorithms were explored to solve the imbalanced sample data problem, which allowed the accuracy of mice motion recognition to improve from similar to 48 \% to similar to 76\% (if shaking is removed from classification, an average accuracy of 86.46\% could be achieved). Less frequent mice behaviors, such as rearing, digging, grooming, drinking, and scratching, could also be recognized at an average accuracy of 96.35\%. We believe this work has the potential to revolutionize animal behavioral tracking methodology by offering a solution for large batches of simultaneous small animal motion tracking and AI-based behavior recognition.},

Within a single industrial domain, there exist many taxonomies that are intended for different applications. Industry specific taxonomies often represent the vocabularies that are commonly used by the practitioners. Their jobs are multi-faceted, which include checking for code and regulatory compliance. As such, it will be very desirable if industry practitioners are able to easily locate and browse regulations of interest. In practice, multiple sources of government regulations exist and they are often organized and classified by the needs of the issuing agencies that enforce them rather than the needs of the communities that use them. One way to bridge these two distinct needs is to develop methods and tools that enable practitioners to browse and retrieve government regulations using their own terms and vocabularies, for example, via existing industry taxonomies. The mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation is a trivial keyword matching task. We examine a relatedness analysis approach for mapping a single taxonomy to multiple regulations. We then present an approach for mapping multiple taxonomies to a single regulation by measuring the relatedness of concepts. Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and market basket analysis are used to measure the semantic relatedness between concepts from two different taxonomies. Preliminary evaluations of the three relatedness analysis measures are performed using examples from the civil engineering and building industry. These examples illustrate the potential benefits of regulatory usage from the mapping between various taxonomies and regulations.},

  abstract = {Background: Early identification and intervention are imperative for suicide prevention. However, at-risk people often neither seek help nor take professional assessment. A tool to automatically assess their risk levels in natural settings can increase the opportunity for early intervention. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore whether computerized language analysis methods can be utilized to assess one's suicide risk and emotional distress in Chinese social media. Methods: A Web-based survey of Chinese social media (ie, Weibo) users was conducted to measure their suicide risk factors including suicide probability, Weibo suicide communication (WSC), depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Participants' Weibo posts published in the public domain were also downloaded with their consent. The Weibo posts were parsed and fitted into Simplified Chinese-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (SC-LIWC) categories. The associations between SC-LIWC features and the 5 suicide risk factors were examined by logistic regression. Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) model was applied based on the language features to automatically classify whether a Weibo user exhibited any of the 5 risk factors. Results: A total of 974 Weibo users participated in the survey. Those with high suicide probability were marked by a higher usage of pronoun (odds ratio, OR=1.18, P=.001), prepend words (OR=1.49, P=.02), multifunction words (OR=1.12, P=.04), a lower usage of verb (OR=0.78, P{$<$}.001), and a greater total word count (OR=1.007, P=.008). Second-person plural was positively associated with severe depression (OR=8.36, P=.01) and stress (OR=11, P=.005), whereas work-related words were negatively associated with WSC (OR=0.71, P=.008), severe depression (OR=0.56, P=.005), and anxiety (OR=0.77, P=.02). Inconsistently, third-person plural was found to be negatively associated with WSC (OR=0.02, P=.047) but positively with severe stress (OR=41.3, P=.04). Achievement-related words were positively associated with depression (OR=1.68, P=.003), whereas health-(OR=2.36, P=.004) and death-related (OR=2.60, P=.01) words positively associated with stress. The machine classifiers did not achieve satisfying performance in the full sample set but could classify high suicide probability (area under the curve, AUC=0.61, P=.04) and severe anxiety (AUC=0.75, P{$<$}.001) among those who have exhibited WSC. Conclusions: SC-LIWC is useful to examine language markers of suicide risk and emotional distress in Chinese social media and can identify characteristics different from previous findings in the English literature. Some findings are leading to new hypotheses for future verification. Machine classifiers based on SC-LIWC features are promising but still require further optimization for application in real life.},

"Grand challenges" thus include mining clinical data sources to automatically generate decision support content. Statistical approaches allow us to learn patterns that reflect real-world standards of care vs. outliers. I will review my efforts developing a collaborative filtering machine-learning approach to clinical order entry, analogous to Netflix or Amazon.com's "Customer's who bought A also bought B" algorithm. This automatically generated decision support content can reproduce, and even optimize, manual constructs like order sets while remaining largely concordant with guidelines and avoiding inappropriate recommendations. This has even more important implications for prevalent cases where well-defined guidelines do not exist. The same methodology is predictive of clinical outcomes comparable to state-of-the-art risk prediction models. Using such methods on routinely generated real-world clinical data will allow us to build knowledge for the future, even as we enhance care today, in a closed-loop learning health system.},

  abstract = {Minimum-joint space width (JSW) is a prevalent clinical parameter in quantifying the joint space narrowing condition in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). In this study, we propose a novel multiple-JSW measurement, which is estimated by a deep learning-based model in an automated manner. The performance of the proposed automated measurement is found to be superior to the conventionally used minimum-JSW in the severity classification and progression prediction of KOA owing to the additional information of the joint space morphology encoded in the new approach. It is further demonstrated that the deep learning-based approach yields comparable performance as the measurement by radiologists. The approach presented in this work may lead to the development of a computer-aided tool for clinical practitioners that could facilitate the KOA diagnosis and prognosis with the fully automated, accurate, and efficient computation of the joint-space parameters. We compared the prediction efficiency of the multiple-joint space width (JSW) and the minimum-JSW on knee osteoarthritis (KOA) severity and progression by using a deep learning approach. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with ResU-Net architecture was developed for knee X-ray imaging segmentation and has attained a segmentation efficiency of 98.9\% intersection over union (IoU) on the distal femur and proximal tibia. Later, by leveraging the image segmentation, the minimum and multiple-JSWs in the tibiofemoral joint were estimated and then validated by radiologist measurements in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman plots. The agreement between the CNN-based estimation and radiologist's measurement of minimum-JSWs reached 0.7801 (p {$<$} 0.0001). The estimated JSWs were deployed to predict the radiographic severity and progression of KOA defined by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades using the XGBoost model. The 64-point multiple-JSWs achieved the best performance in predicting KOA progression within 48 months, with the area-under-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.621, outperforming the commonly used minimum-JSW with 0.554 AUC. We provided a fully automated radiographic assessment tool for KOA with comparable performance to the radiologists and showed that the fine-grained measurement of multiple-JSWs yields superior prediction performance for KOA over the minimum-JSW.},

  abstract = {Older people are increasingly dependent on others to support their daily activities due to geriatric symptoms such as dementia. Some of them stay in long-term care facilities. Elderly people with night wandering behaviour may lose their way, leading to a significant risk of injuries. The eNightLog system was developed to monitor the night-time bedside activities of older people in order to help them cope with this issue. It comprises a 3D time-of-flight near-infrared sensor and an ultra-wideband sensor for detecting human presence and to determine postures without a video camera. A threshold-based algorithm was developed to classify different activities, such as leaving the bed. The system is able to send alarm messages to caregivers if an elderly user performs undesirable activities. In this study, 17 sets of eNightLog systems were installed in an elderly hostel with 17 beds in 9 bedrooms. During the three-month field test, 26 older people with different periods of stay were included in the study. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of detecting non-assisted bed-leaving events was 99.8\%, 100\%, and 99.6\%, respectively. There were only three false alarms out of 2762 bed-exiting events. Our results demonstrated that the eNightLog system is sufficiently accurate to be applied in the hostel environment. Machine learning with instance segmentation and online learning will enable the system to be used for widely different environments and people, with improvements to be made in future studies.},

  abstract = {Conventional algorithms for modeling clinical events focus on characterizing the differences between patients with varying outcomes in historical data sets used for the model derivation. For many clinical conditions with low prevalence and where small data sets are available, this approach to developing models is challenging due to the limited number of positive (that is, event) examples available for model training. Here, we investigate how the approach of developing clinical models might be improved across three distinct patient populations (patients with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the DISPERSE2-TIMI33 and MERLIN-TIMI36 trials, patients undergoing inpatient surgery in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry, and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium registry). For each of these cases, we supplement an incomplete characterization of patient outcomes in the derivation data set (uncensored view of the data) with an additional characterization of the extent to which patients differ from the statistical support of their clinical characteristics (censored view of the data). Our approach exploits the same training data within the derivation cohort in multiple ways to improve the accuracy of prediction. We position this approach within the context of traditional supervised (2-class) and unsupervised (1-class) learning methods and present a 1.5-class approach for clinical decision-making. We describe a 1.5-class support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm that implements this approach, and report on its performance relative to logistic regression and 2-class SVM classification with cost-sensitive weighting and oversampling. The 1.5-class SVM algorithm improved prediction accuracy relative to other approaches and may have value in predicting clinical events both at the bedside and for risk-adjusted quality of care assessment.},

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop a highly accurate, portable FMD and to demonstrate real-time monitoring of force applied by health professionals during JMT without altering its execution. METHODS: The FMD was constructed using the FlexiForce sensor, potential divider, ATmega 328 microcontroller, customwritten software, and liquid crystal display. The calibration, accuracy, and cyclic repeatability of the FMD were tested from 0 to 90 N applied load with a gold standard universal testing machine. For practical demonstration, the FMD was tested for monitoring applied force by a physiotherapist while performing Maitland's grade I to IV over the 6th cervical vertebra among 30 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The obtained Bland-Altman plot limits agreement for accuracy, and cyclic repeatability was 1.57 N to 1.22 N, and 1.26 N to 1.26 N, respectively with standard deviation and standard error of the mean values of 3.77\% and 0.73\% and 2.15\% and 0.23\%, respectively. The test-retest reliability of the FMD tested by the same researcher at an interval of one week showed an excellent intra-class correlation coefficient of r = 1.00. The obtained force readings for grade I to IV among 30 subjects ranged from 10.33 N to 45.24 N. CONCLUSIONS: Appreciable performance of the developed FMD suggested that it may be useful to monitor force applied by clinicians during JMT among neck pain subjects and is a useful educational tool for academicians to teach mobilization skills.},

It involves dysfunction of blood sugar regulation resulting from insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, or excessive glucagon secretion. Methods: This study collated 971,401 drug usage records of 51,009 DM patients. These data include patient identification code, age, gender, outpatient visiting dates, visiting code, medication features (included items, doses, and frequencies of drugs), HbA1c results, and testing time. We apply a random forest (RF) model for feature selection and implement a regression model with the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep learning architecture. Finally, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index for the prediction model. Results: After data cleaning, the data included 8,729 male and 9,115 female cases. Metformin was the most important feature suggested by the RF model, followed by glimepiride, acarbose, pioglitazone, glibenclamide, gliclazide, repaglinide, nateglinide, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin. The model performed better with the past two seasons in the training data than with additional seasons. Further, the Bi-LSTM architecture model performed better than support vector machines (SVMs). Discussion \& Conclusion: This study found that Bi-LSTM models is a well kernel in a CDSS which help physicians' decision-making, and the increasing the number of seasons will negative impact the performance. In addition, this study found that the most important drug is metformin, which is recommended as first-line treatment OHA in various situations for DM patients.},

  abstract = {The referral is the key source of information that enables radiologists and radiographers to provide quality services. However, the frequency of suboptimal referrals is widely reported. This research reviews the literature to illuminate the challenges suboptimal referrals present to the delivery of care in radiology departments. The concept of suboptimal referral includes information, that is; missing, insufficient, inconsistent, misleading, hard to interpret or wrong. The research uses the four ethical principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, Autonomy and Justice as an analytic framework.Suboptimal referrals can cause harm by hindering safe contrast-media administration, proper radiation protection by justification of procedures, and compassionate patient care. Suboptimal referrals also hinder promoting patient benefits from the correct choice of imaging modality and protocol, an optimal performed examination, and an accurate radiology report. Additionally, patient autonomy is compromised from the lack of information needed to facilitate benefit-risk communication. Finally, suboptimal referrals challenge justice based on lack of reasonable patient prioritising and the unfairness caused by unnecessary examinations.These findings illuminate how suboptimal referrals can inhibit good health and well-being for patients in relation to safety, missed opportunities, patient anxiety and dissatisfaction. The ethical challenges identified calls for solutions. Referral-decision support tools and artificial intelligence may improve referral quality, when implemented. Strategies addressing efforts of radiology professionals are inevitable, including gatekeeping, shared decision-making and inter-professional communication; thereby raising awareness of the importance of good referral quality and promoting commitment to ethical professional conduct.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

As artificial intelligence (AI)-based teledermatology services hold promise in redefining the melanoma screening paradigm, a study that evaluates user satisfaction with a smartphonecompatible, AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator is lacking. Methods: Data was collected between April and May 2019 in Taiwan. To assess user satisfaction with MoleMe, an AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator on a smartphone, users were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate four aspects, including interaction, impact on daily life, usability, and overall performance, after completing a MoleMe evaluation session. For each question, users could rank their satisfaction level from 1 to 5, with five showing strongly satisfied and one showing strongly unsatisfied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare user satisfaction among different age groups, genders, and risk predictions received. Result: A total of 1231 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Over 90\% of the participants were satisfied (score = 4 or 5) and over 75\% of the participants were strongly satisfied (score 5) with MoleMe, in terms of usability, interaction, and impact on daily life. The user satisfaction did not show a significant difference between genders, age groups, and risk predictions received. (all P {$>$} 0.05) Conclusion: With high user satisfaction regardless of age group, gender, and risk prediction received, AI based teledermatology services on a smartphone such as MoleMe may potentially achieve widespread usage and be beneficial to both patients and physicians.

  abstract = {Simple Summary Glioblastomas carry a poor prognosis and usually presents with heterogeneous regions in the brain tumor. Multi-parametric MR images can show morphological characteristics. Radiomics features refer to the extraction of a large number of quantitative measurements that describe the geometry, intensity, and texture which were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images from anatomical MRI and metabolic features from PET. It also provides a qualitative image interpretation as well as cellular, molecular, and tumor properties. Thus, it derives additional information about the entire tumor volume which is generally of irregular shape and size from routinely evaluated "non-invasive" imaging biomarkers techniques. We demonstrated volumetric habitats and signatures in necrosis, solid tumor, peritumoral tissue, and edema with key biological processes and phenotype features. This provides physicians with key information on how the disease is progressing in the brain and can also give an indication of how well treatment is working. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor of the central nervous system. It encroaches on brain tissue with heterogeneous regions of a necrotic core, solid part, peritumoral tissue, and edema. This study provided qualitative image interpretation in GBM subregions and radiomics features in quantitative usage of image analysis, as well as ratios of these tumor components. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of multi-parametric MR fingerprinting with volumetric tumor phenotype and radiomic features to underlie biological process and prognostic status of patients with cerebral gliomas. Based on efficiently classified and retrieved cerebral multi-parametric MRI, all data were analyzed to derive volume-based data of the entire tumor from local cohorts and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) cohorts with GBM. Edema was mainly enriched for homeostasis whereas necrosis was associated with texture features. The proportional volume size of the edema was about 1.5 times larger than the size of the solid part tumor. The volume size of the solid part was approximately 0.7 times in the necrosis area. Therefore, the multi-parametric MRI-based radiomics model reveals efficiently classified tumor subregions of GBM and suggests that prognostic radiomic features from routine MRI examination may also be significantly associated with key biological processes as a practical imaging biomarker.},

  abstract = {Background: Computerized decision support systems have been effective in improving patient care in a variety of diseases and care settings. However, these systems can be challenging to implement in the ED setting because patients are of ten undifferentiated and lack a documented diagnosis to trigger decision support systems. Analysis of the triage nurse's free text as part of a prediction algorithm presents a unique opportunity to use commonly collected data that is available early in a patient's course to identify patients who might benefit from decision support. Study Objective: To determine the incremental effect of triage nurses' free-text assessments within a machine learning algorithm to predict infection compared to triage data alone. Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort study that derived a machine learning algorithm to predict infection at triage at a 55,000 visit/year Level 1 trauma center/ tertiary academic teaching hospital. All patients presenting to the ED between 12/16/ 08 and 10/1/10 were included in the study. A patient was determined to have infection if 1 of their ED ICD9 discharge diagnoses contained an ICD9 diagnosis defined by the Angus Sepsis ICD9 abstraction criteria. Triage data included age, sex, acuity (emergency severity index), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, pain scale, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm was used to cluster words in triage nurses' free-text assessments into 500 topics. The triage assessment for each patient is then represented as a probability distribution over these 500 topics. To obtain the prediction function, we used a multivariate logistic regression with infection as the response variable and triage data and topic distribution as predictors. Result(s): A total of 94,973 patients were included in the study. These patients were then randomly allocated to train (n = 60,793; 64\%), validate (n= 15,199; 16\%), and test (n= 18,981; 20\%) data sets. The area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) for the triage vital sign data alone was 0.67 (train), 0.69 (validate), and 0.67 (test). The ROC-AUC for the triage vital sign data with the triage nurse free text was 0.88 (train), 0.86 (validate), and 0.87 (test). Conclusion(s): Triage nursing free text dramatically improves the discriminatory power of machine learning algorithms to identify infection at triage (ROC-AUC 0.88 vs. 0.67). Future study is needed to prospectively evaluate whether this algorithm could trigger decision supports systems to help clinicians order lactate, initiate early antibiotics, guide clinicians through earlygoal-directed therapy, or other pathways to improve patient care.},

Machine Learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in efficiently analyzing those big data, but a general misunderstanding of ML algorithms still exists in applying them (e.g., ML techniques can settle a problem of small sample size, or deep learning is the ML algorithm). This paper reviewed the research of diagnosing mental illness using ML algorithm and suggests how ML techniques can be employed and worked in practice. Methods Researches about mental illness diagnostic using ML techniques were carefully reviewed. Five traditional ML algorithms-Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)-frequently used for mental health area researches were systematically organized and summarized. Results Based on literature review, it turned out that Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) were frequently employed in mental health area, but many researchers did not clarify the reason for using their ML algorithm though every ML algorithm has its own advantages. In addition, there were several studies to apply ML algorithms without fully understanding the data characteristics. Conclusion Researchers using ML algorithms should be aware of the properties of their ML algorithms and the limitation of the results they obtained under restricted data conditions. This paper provides useful information of the properties and limitation of each ML algorithm in the practice of mental health.},

We derived usage patterns using tensor factorization and found the following six optimal usage patterns: 1) social networking services (SNS) during daytime, 2) web surfing, 3) SNS at night, 4) mobile shopping, 5) entertainment, and 6) gaming at night. The membership vectors of the six patterns obtained a significantly better prediction performance than the raw data. For all patterns, the usage times of the SUD were much longer than those of the SUC. From our findings, we concluded that usage patterns and membership vectors were effective tools to assess and predict smartphone dependence and could provide an intervention guideline to predict and treat smartphone dependence based on usage data.},

  abstract = {Background: Death by suicide is a preventable public health concern worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the probability of suicide death using baseline characteristics and simple medical facility visit history data using Cox regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). Method: This study included 819,951 subjects in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)–Cohort Sample Database from 2004 to 2013. The dataset was divided randomly into two independent training and validation groups. To improve the performance of predicting suicide death, we applied SVM and DNN to the same training set as the Cox regression model. Results: Among the study population, 2546 people died by intentional self-harm during the follow-up time. Sex, age, type of insurance, household income, disability, and medical records of eight ICD-10 codes (including mental and behavioural disorders) were selected by a Cox regression model with backward stepwise elimination. The area of under the curve (AUC) of Cox regression (0.688), SVM (0.687), and DNN (0.683) were approximately the same. The group with top .5\% of predicted probability had hazard ratio of 26.21 compared to that with the lowest 10\% of predicted probability. Limitations: This study is limited by the lack of information on suicidal ideation and attempts, other potential covariates such as information of medication and subcategory ICD-10 codes. Moreover, predictors from the prior 12–24 months of the date of death could be expected to show better performances than predictors from up to 10 years ago. Conclusions: We suggest a 10-year probability prediction model for suicide death using general characteristics and simple insurance data, which are annually conducted by the Korean government. Suicide death prevention might be enhanced by our prediction model.},

  abstract = {Faunal remains from archaeological sites allow for the identification of animal species that enables the better understanding of the relationships between humans and animals, not only from their morphological information, but also from the ancient biomolecules (lipids, proteins, and DNA) preserved in these remains for thousands and even millions of years. However, due to the costs and efforts required for ancient biomolecular analysis, there has been considerable research into development of accurate and efficient screening approaches for archaeological remains. FTIR spectroscopy is one such approach that has been considered for screening of proteins, but its widespread use has been hindered by the fact that its predictive accuracy can vary widely depending on the extent of sample preservation and the instrument used. Further, screening methods for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis are scarce. Here we present a new approach to vastly improve upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) and aDNA analysis through the use of random forest-based machine learning. To do so, we use ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyse them by ZooMS (for taxonomic identification). Two of these are from Palaeolithic contexts, dominated by terrestrial fauna and include specimens with a variety of preservational conditions. The third set consists of Holocene faunal remains, with variable levels of preservation and is dominated by cetaceans. Using the Holocene faunal remains, we were able to more consistently evaluate ATR-FTIR-based screening for mtDNA as well as ZooMS success. We report on the potential of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis, and our machine learning models conclusively improve the accuracy prior to usage of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20?40\%. The results also suggest this approach potentially allows for a universal screening system, applicable across multiple sites and largely independent of the spectrometers used.},

  abstract = {Combination therapy is critical to improving therapeutic options against cancer. This is particular true when striving to improve overall response rates for increasingly specific molecularly targeted therapeutics. As the number of therapeutic options increases, identifying an optimised drug combination from amongst a range of available drug sets is virtually impossible by conventional methods due to the large search space. Further complicating drug combination design and implementation in cancer is patient heterogeneity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools are beginning to impact positively impact all facets of drug development and personalised medicine. Rather than aggregating large datasets from other sources (public/private data repositories, text-mining, etc.) to develop predictive models, we recently developed an experimentally-driven small dataset AI platform, Quantitative Parabolic Optimization Platform (QPOP), to identify and rank drug combinations from a specific drug set search space. Upon identifying the queried drug set as well as a desired biological system of interest to interrogate, QPOP can identify optimal drug combinations against specific systems of interests, including drug resistant cancers, utilising small datasets built from drug combination tests designed using orthogonal array composite design. QPOP does not rely on molecular mechanism modelling but rather uses specific quality controlled experimental data to rationally identify optimal drug combinations. In applications towards haematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma and lymphomas, novel epigenetic-based drug combinations were able to be identified against drug-resistant refractory/relapsed cases. Because of the efficiency of QPOP towards designing optimal drug combinations as well as the dosages within these combinations, this approach was applied across all levels of drug development, from in vitro and in vivo preclinical models to ex vivo patient sample analysis. Novel epigenetic-based drug combinations were validated to outperform standard of care in preclinical mouse models. Additionally, QPOP analysis of drug combination with ex vivo patient samples effectively ranked patient-specific drug combination sensitivities for both novel epigenetic-based drug combinations as well as standard of care drug combinations. The work presented in this study presents evidence for the use of QPOP toward faster and more efficient drug combination development as well as towards personalized oncology clinical decision support. The efficiency and flexible of QPOP reduces the time and costs associated drug combination design and evaluation, allowing for faster and cheaper implementation into both drug development and health technology applications.},

  abstract = {Objective: Clinical phenomenology remains the primary means for classifying psychoses despite considerable evidence that this method incompletely captures biologically meaningful differentiations. Rather than relying on clinical diagnoses as the gold standard, this project drew on neurobiological heterogeneity among psychosis cases to delineate subgroups independent of their phenomenological manifestations. Method: A large biomarker panel (neuropsychological, stop signal, saccadic control, and auditory stimulation paradigms) characterizing diverse aspects of brain function was collected on individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis (N=711), their first-degree relatives (N=883), and demographically comparable healthy subjects (N=278). Biomarker variance across paradigms was exploited to create nine integrated variables that were used to capture neurobiological variance among the psychosis cases. Data on external validating measures (social functioning, structural magnetic resonance imaging, family biomarkers, and clinical information) were collected. Results: Multivariate taxometric analyses identified three neurobiologically distinct psychosis biotypes that did not respect clinical diagnosis boundaries. The same analysis procedure using clinical DSM diagnoses as the criteria was best described by a single severity continuum (schizophrenia worse than schizoaffective disorder worse than bipolar psychosis); this was not the case for biotypes. The external validating measures supported the distinctiveness of these subgroups compared with clinical diagnosis, highlighting a possible advantage of neurobiological versus clinical categorization schemes for differentiating psychotic disorders. Conclusions: These data illustrate how multiple pathways may lead to clinically similar psychosis manifestations, and they provide explanations for the marked heterogeneity observed across laboratories on the same biomarker variables when DSM diagnoses are used as the gold standard.},

  abstract = {Dairy farmers use herd management systems, behavioral sensors, feeding lists, breeding schedules, and health records to document herd characteristics. Consequently, large amounts of dairy data are becoming available. However, a lack of data integration makes it difficult for farmers to analyze the data on their dairy farm, which indicates that these data are currently not being used to their full potential. Hence, multiple issues in dairy farming such as low longevity, poor performance, and health issues remain. We aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) methods can solve some of these existing issues in dairy farming. This review summarizes peer-reviewed ML papers published in the dairy sector between 2015 and 2020. Ultimately, 97 papers from the subdomains of management, physiology, reproduction, behavior analysis, and feeding were considered in this review. The results confirm that ML algorithms have become common tools in most areas of dairy research, particularly to predict data. Despite the quantity of research available, most tested algorithms have not performed sufficiently for a reliable implementation in practice. This may be due to poor training data. The availability of data resources from multiple farms covering longer periods would be useful to improve prediction accuracies. In conclusion, ML is a promising tool in dairy research, which could be used to develop and improve decision support for farmers. As the cow is a multifactorial system, ML algorithms could analyze integrated data sources that describe and ultimately allow managing cows according to all relevant influencing factors. However, both the integration of multiple data sources and the obtainability of public data currently remain challenging.Copyright © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Method: Data are drawn from a randomized comparison of CBT versus PDT for depression (N = 167, 71\% female, mean-age = 39.6). The approach combines four different statistical techniques to identify patient characteristics associated consistently with differential treatment response. Variables are combined to generate predictions indicating each individual’s optimal-treatment. The average outcomes for patients who received their indicated treatment versus those who did not were compared retrospectively to estimate model utility. Results: Of 49 predictors examined, depression severity, anxiety sensitivity, extraversion, and psychological treatment-needs were included in the final model. The average post-treatment Hamilton-Depression-Rating-Scale score was 1.6 points lower (95\%CI = [0.5:2.8]; d = 0.21) for those who received their indicated-treatment compared to non-indicated. Among the 60\% of patients with the strongest treatment recommendations, that advantage grew to 2.6 (95\%CI = [1.4:3.7]; d = 0.37). Conclusions: Variable selection procedures differ in their characterization of the importance of predictive variables. Attending to consistently-indicated predictors may be sensible when constructing treatment selection models. The small N and lack of separate validation sample indicate a need for prospective tests before this model is used.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to provide comprehensive diagnostic and candidate analyses in a pediatric rare disease cohort through the Genomic Answers for Kids program. Methods: Extensive analyses of 960 families with suspected genetic disorders included short read exome sequencing and short-read genome sequencing (srGS); PacBio HiFi long-read genome sequencing (HiFi-GS); variant calling for single nucleotide variants (SNV), structural variant (SV), and repeat variants; and machine-learning variant prioritization. Structured phenotypes, prioritized variants, and pedigrees were stored in PhenoTips database, with data sharing through controlled access the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Results: Diagnostic rates ranged from 11\% in patients with prior negative genetic testing to 34.5\% in naive patients. Incorporating SVs from genome sequencing added up to 13\% of new diagnoses in previously unsolved cases. HiFi-GS yielded increased discovery rate with {$>$}4-fold more rare coding SVs compared with srGS. Variants and genes of unknown significance remain the most common finding (58\% of nondiagnostic cases). Conclusion: Computational prioritization is efficient for diagnostic SNVs. Thorough identifi- cation of non-SNVs remains challenging and is partly mitigated using HiFi-GS sequencing. Importantly, community research is supported by sharing real-time data to accelerate gene validation and by providing HiFi variant (SNV/SV) resources from {$>$}1000 human alleles to facilitate implementation of new sequencing platforms for rare disease diagnoses.

  abstract = {The past decade has seen a spectacular evolution in data storage capacities, digitization of health information, and national policies to implement structures and procedures for data integration and access. Consequently, large datasets of routinely collected data have become available and these provide unique opportunities for health care and health care research. In my lecture I will build on a systematic review performed by the EAPC taskforce on big data in end-of-life care research, relevant published studies, and research performed by my own team to illustrate what big data can mean for palliative care research. Using concrete examples, I will discuss 6 functions: 1) Population needs assessment and monitoring. This is where most of the palliative care research using big data has focused on. It includes efforts to estimate the need for palliative care within the entire population, describe patterns of health care resource use or the prevalence of problems, and identify inequities in end-of-life care. The volume, velocity end veracity of big data clearly provide distinct advantages over traditional research designs such as surveys which often suffer from recruitment, retention, missing data and other issues jeopardizing the generalizability of the findings. However, content validity can be a challenge as data have usually been collected for administrative efforts other than research or evaluation 2) I will, therefore, illustrate how validation efforts can be undertaken to use available routinely collected data as a reliable and affordable basis for health care system and quality of care evaluations. Using a validated set of quality indicators data I will illustrate how the quality of end-of-life care can be compared between health care regions or health care providers and how relative performance standards can be set. 3) Addressing causality. A lot of questions around causality remain unanswered in palliative and end-of-life care. These are ideally addressed in a randomized trial. However, such trials are particularly challenging in end-of-life care populations and we cannot conduct (enough) target trials to answer all relevant causal questions relevant to palliative care. Building on insights from the so-called 'causal revolution' I will discuss the possibilities (and limits) of causal inference from observational population data. 4) We can then also use the data to efficiently evaluate whether policies, interventions, programs have their intended effects in the real world. 5) More efficient data collection methods for palliative care trials. Palliative care trials often experience serious challenges to internal validity (e.g., due to attrition and missing data) and external validity (e.g., due to pragmatic selection of participants). If the availability of big data for the patients or family carers who enroll in trials makes the studies less dependent on traditional data collection methods this may improve enrollment, retention and completeness of data. What are the opportunities and challenges? 6) A final function is prediction and prospective decision support. This is the function where the expectation (and hot stuff bias?) has perhaps been greatest. Will artificial intelligence and data-driven algorithms indeed provide palliative care with what it often promises? Big data has several promises for palliative care research but it also suffers from several limitations and caution for overrated promises continues to be pertinent.},

Exploiting the high-frequency "noise" in handpump accelerometry data, we model high-rate wave forms using robust machine learning techniques sensitive to the subtle interaction between pumping action and groundwater depth. We compare three methods for representing accelerometry data (wavelets, splines, Gaussian processes) with two systems for estimating groundwater depth (support vector regression, Gaussian process regression), and apply three systems to evaluate the results (held-out periods, held-out recordings, balanced datasets). Results indicate that the method using splines and support vector regression provides the lowest overall errors. We discuss further testing and the potential of using Africa's accidental infrastructure to harmonise groundwater monitoring systems with rural water-security goals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier - comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns - that had an 83\% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79\% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72\% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention. More broadly, automated linguistic analysis can be a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment across neuropsychiatry.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Prostate Cancer is one of the main threats to men's health. Its accurate diagnosis is crucial to properly treat patients depending on the cancer's level of aggressiveness. Tumor risk-stratification is still a challenging task due to the difficulties met during the reading of multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Images. Artificial Intelligence models may help radiologists in staging the aggressiveness of the equivocal lesions, reducing inter-observer variability and evaluation time. However, these algorithms need many high-quality images to work efficiently, bringing up overfitting and lack of standardization and reproducibility as emerging issues to be addressed. This study attempts to illustrate the state of the art of current research of Artificial Intelligence methods to stratify prostate cancer for its clinical significance suggesting how widespread use of public databases could be a possible solution to these issues. Many efforts have been carried out for the standardization of multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (mp-MR) images evaluation to detect Prostate Cancer (PCa), and specifically to differentiate levels of aggressiveness, a crucial aspect for clinical decision-making. Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has contributed noteworthily to this aim. Nevertheless, as pointed out by the European Association of Urology (EAU 2020), the PI-RADS still has limitations mainly due to the moderate inter-reader reproducibility of mp-MRI. In recent years, many aspects in the diagnosis of cancer have taken advantage of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as detection, segmentation of organs and/or lesions, and characterization. Here a focus on AI as a potentially important tool for the aim of standardization and reproducibility in the characterization of PCa by mp-MRI is reported. AI includes methods such as Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques that have shown to be successful in classifying mp-MR images, with similar performances obtained by radiologists. Nevertheless, they perform differently depending on the acquisition system and protocol used. Besides, these methods need a large number of samples that cover most of the variability of the lesion aspect and zone to avoid overfitting. The use of publicly available datasets could improve AI performance to achieve a higher level of generalizability, exploiting large numbers of cases and a big range of variability in the images. Here we explore the promise and the advantages, as well as emphasizing the pitfall and the warnings, outlined in some recent studies that attempted to classify clinically significant PCa and indolent lesions using AI methods. Specifically, we focus on the overfitting issue due to the scarcity of data and the lack of standardization and reproducibility in every step of the mp-MR image acquisition and the classifier implementation. In the end, we point out that a solution can be found in the use of publicly available datasets, whose usage has already been promoted by some important initiatives. Our future perspective is that AI models may become reliable tools for clinicians in PCa diagnosis, reducing inter-observer variability and evaluation time.},

Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. Methods: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. Results: A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. Conclusions: The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news. The application of the developed classifier enables the exploration of news and extraction of health-related insights, based on the MeSH thesaurus, through a similar workflow as in the usage of PubMed, with which most health researchers are familiar.},

  abstract = {Background: Automatic or semi-automatic software tools have proven to be successful at assisting practitioners in the diagnosis of pathologies. The headaches domain is challenging due to the high amount of possible diagnosis and diagnostic criteria. The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3), is considered by the World Health Organization as the official classification of headaches. ICHD-3 provides specific diagnostic criteria for diagnosing known headaches. The possible diagnoses are organized in a hierarchical structure that expresses the existing relationships between them. ICHD-3 guidelines are written in natural language and are intended to be read and understood by practitioners, while machines are not capable of automatically reading and understanding them. Method(s): We adopt Artificial Intelligence techniques in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in order to formally represent the knowledge present in the ICHD-3 guidelines. On top of such formal representation we build a decision support system for the diagnosis of headaches. From a technological perspective, we adopt standard Web development frameworks for implementing distributed applications so to make the resulting system easily accessible by practitioners and platform independent. Result(s): We transformed the ICHD-3 guidelines into a formal representation based on known formalisms for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Headaches have been formally encoded into a hierarchical structure known as taxonomy and diagnostic criteria have been encoded in terms of logical rules. The resulting representation is precise and captures the knowledge present into ICHD-3. By leveraging on the formal representation, we devised a web platformthat assists practitioners during their diagnosing process. The system implements a multiple step process and at each step recommends, relevant questions to ask the patient and exploits the answers to narrow down the diagnosis, visually presenting the practitioner the advancement in the diagnosis in terms of confirmed, excluded and not-yet determined diagnosis. At each step, the next question to be asked is determined automatically by selecting the question that maximizes the number of diagnosis that become determined. Conclusion(s): We developed a web application that helps practitioners in the diagnosis of headaches as specified in the ICHD-3 guidelines. By using state-of-the-art techniques for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, the system fully captures the knowledge present in ICHD-3 and is thus precise in the classification. The systems architecture is general purpose and it is designed to be easily adaptable to new versions of the guidelines.},

Stakeholder feedback may facilitate adoption of such tools. This evaluation gathered stakeholder feedback and preferences to explore whether it would be fundamentally feasible or possible to implement an automated fidelity-scoring supervision tool in community mental health settings. A partially mixed, sequential research method design was used including focus group discussions with community mental health therapists (n\,=\,18) and clinical leadership (n\,=\,12) to explore typical supervision practices, followed by discussion of an automated fidelity feedback tool embedded in a cloud-based supervision platform. Interpretation of qualitative findings was enhanced through quantitative measures of participants’ use of technology and perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the tool. Initial perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of automated fidelity tools were positive and increased after introduction of an automated tool. Standard supervision was described as collaboratively guided and focused on clinical content, self-care, and documentation. Participants highlighted the tool’s utility for supervision, training, and professional growth, but questioned its ability to evaluate rapport, cultural responsiveness, and non-verbal communication. Concerns were raised about privacy and the impact of low scores on therapist confidence. Desired features included intervention labeling and transparency about how scores related to session content. Opportunities for asynchronous, remote, and targeted supervision were particularly valued. Stakeholder feedback suggests that automated fidelity measurement could augment supervision practices. Future research should examine the relations among use of such supervision tools, clinician skill, and client outcomes.},

  abstract = {Purpose Clinical trials, guidelines, and patient data form the basis for clinical decision making in cardiovascular medicine. The available knowledge is distributed, partially incomprehensible and does not apply to all patient groups, making an up-to-date, personalized and evidencebased therapeutic decision difficult. Some therapy decisions rely heavily on composite score-based classifications of image-or physiology-based metrics that describe the extent of disease (such as the SYNTAX score: scoring of anatomical complexity of coronary lesions), which are currently -if at all-, calculated by ''hand''. In addition, the interval of guideline publications cannot keep the pace of the accumulating published evidence. In conclusion, implementing evidence-based cardiac care is currently a time consuming, complicated, and not necessarily reproducible task. We hypothesize that computationally augmented decision making in the Heart Team will overcome these obstacles, and thus will improve patient outcomes. Methods To develop a therapy decision support system (TDSS) for heart teams one need to consider the complete decision-making workflow from the source of evidence-based medicine to the clinical decision making. This includes sources for data and domain knowledge, appropriate machine intelligence (MI) methodologies and tools, required expertise, use cases and legal constrains for decision support, and communication interfaces. Various data-driven MI-methodologies exist (e.g., deep neural networks, biophysical models, Arden Syntax, and probabilistic graphical models), each has strength and weaknesses (e.g., self-learning, transparency, readability, and computation complexity) and are therefore more or less suitable to support individual clinical tasks and decisions. A Bayesian network, a probabilistic graphical model, is specifically suitable to support comprehensive interdisciplinary therapy decisions [1], with a complexity by means of required transparency, human readability and reproducibility, limitations in data access, required modelling by domain expert. MI-based methods usually require large datasets of high quality (i.e., complete, correct, and diverse). Data access is nowadays still limited to institutional sources, and data pre-processing remains a time-consuming manual process. In the next years, new data and communication standards will provide the necessary accesses [2]; especially promising are HL7's FHIR standard for HER interoperability and the IEEE SDC standard for vendor-independent interoperability of medical devices. Results The following presents the concept of a Virtual Heart Team (VHT): an MI augmented environment for evidence-based and data-driven therapeutic decision support, see Fig. 1. Within this concept we consider the general principles of A) Evidence-based Medicine and extend it to a B) Model-based Medical Evidence [2]. In evidencebased medicine the evidence originates from C) Clinical trials that 1) provide the raw data. The raw data include all types of the study participant's records (e.g., personal information, radiological images and genetic analyses) that are gathered routinely in such trials. Further D) Processing and analysis of the data leads to 2) knowledge and publications, which are then used by E) Guideline committee meetings (e.g., the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology) to modify existing or develop new 3) guidelines and recommendations. A F) Clinical specialists, representing the G) local expertise of a heart team, apply this knowledge when reviewing the H) patient data to 4) enable appropriate I) therapy decision making and communication at J) heart team meetings, K) patient communication, and in the L) operating room (OR). In the concept of model-based medical evidence, we consider the processes of evidence-based medicine as described but extend them by the M) Development of a Virtual Heart Team; a therapy decision model that integrates and constantly updates the evidence-based knowledge of a heart team. The development begins with the N) Graph modelling that 5) results in a O) VHT graph Model, which is the 6) basis for its P) Probabilistic Modelling. The VHT probabilistic graphical model is semi-automatically developed and maintained through appropriate expert-modelling and machine learning tools. However, a team of Q) Medical knowledge engineers 7) coordinate and support the entire modelling process to ensure a coherent model. They provide Q) repositories of data and tools with engines for expert modelling, machine learning, model access, and model interaction. The 8) access to the repositories and engines is realized through a conceptual Medical Information and Model Management System (MIMMS) [2]; an information and model communication interface using established data format and communication standards. For the graph model, the guideline committee 9) provides the fundamental knowledge. Ideally, the medical knowledge engineers would provide appropriate modelling tools to support the guideline writing processes at the guideline meetings and at the same time compile the desired graph models. Otherwise, the information can be 10) extracted from the guidelines' underlying analytical results and publications using NLP tools and the support of the knowledge engineers. Once a basic graph model exists, the probabilities can be trained (by means of machine learning) or modelled by experts. Ideally, from the raw data 11) provided by the clinical trials, 12) provided by hospitals through a common or connected MIMMS, and 6) completed by guideline experts when appropriate data is missing. The resulting VHT model is a comprehensive representation of the available knowledge and can 13) serve the guideline committee for a more transparent and comprehensible communication, and 14) serve clinical trial sponsors to target forceful hypotheses. Finally, hospitals will need appropriate tools and repositories to 15) integrate a T) VHT model-based therapy decision support system. With 16) provided patient data, the system 17) infers a U) patient-specific VHT model, which enables a model-based decision support. Conclusion We conceptualized a VHT development to provide transparent, human-understandable, and reproducible decision support to heart teams. The VHT's strengths are its underlying knowledge base, which is based on medical evidence and enhanced by expert knowledge. To enable the model development will require support from guideline committees and access to raw data, which is the bottle neck the development. Methods and tools for machine learning and expert modelling exist but will need further development. To ensure the quality of a VHT-based therapy decision support system, the model probabilities may require population-related adjustments and validation on site. A quality management concept for probabilistic graphical models exists, but will also need further optimization. (Figure Presented) .},

Random combinations of various CLIs (ie, CLI combinations) were utilized to establish COVID-19 versus CAP classifiers with machine learning algorithms, including random forest classifier (RFC), logistic regression classifier, and gradient boosting classifier (GBC). The performance of the classifiers was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall rate in COVID-19 prediction using the test data set. Results: The classifiers that were constructed with three algorithms from 43 CLI combinations showed high performance (recall rate {$>$}0.9 and AUROC {$>$}0.85) in COVID-19 prediction for the test data set. Among the high-performance classifiers, several CLIs showed a high usage rate; these included procalcitonin (PCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), uric acid, albumin, albumin to globulin ratio (AGR), neutrophil count, red blood cell (RBC) count, monocyte count, basophil count, and white blood cell (WBC) count. They also had high feature importance except for basophil count. The feature combination (FC) of PCT, AGR, uric acid, WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, RBC count, and MCHC was the representative one among the nine FCs used to construct the classifiers with an AUROC equal to 1.0 when using the RFC or GBC algorithms. Replacing any CLI in these FCs would lead to a significant reduction in the performance of the classifiers that were built with them. Conclusions: The classifiers constructed with only a few specific CLIs could efficiently distinguish COVID-19 from CAP, which could help clinicians perform early isolation and centralized management of COVID-19 patients.},

It is critical that medical first responders are well trained to deal with emergencies more effectively. This would require real-time monitoring and feedback for each trainee. Therefore, we introduced a voice-based SA to augment the training process of medical first responders and enhance their performance in the field. The potential benefits of SAs include a reduction in training costs and enhanced monitoring mechanisms. Despite the increased usage of voice-based personal assistants (PAs) in day-to-day life, the associated effects are commonly neglected for a study of human factors. Therefore, this paper focuses on performance analysis of the developed voice-based SA in emergency care provider training for a selected emergency treatment scenario. The research discussed in this paper follows design science in developing proposed technology; at length, we discussed architecture and development and presented working results of voice-based SA. The empirical testing was conducted on two groups as user studies using statistical analysis tools, one trained with conventional methods and the other with the help of SA. The statistical results demonstrated the amplification in training efficacy and performance of medical responders powered by SA. Furthermore, the paper also discusses the accuracy and time of task execution (t) and concludes with the guidelines for resolving the identified problems.},

Here, we used a murine kidney transplantation model and single cell transcriptomics to dissect the contribution of myeloid cell subsets and their potential signaling pathways to kidney transplant rejection. Using a variety of bioinformatic techniques. including machine learning, we demonstrate that kidney allograft-infiltrating myeloid cells followed a trajectory of differentiation from monocytes to proinflammatory macrophages, and they exhibited distinct interactions with kidney allograft parenchymal cells. While this process correlated with a unique pattern of myeloid cell transcripts, a top gene identified was Axl, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family Tyro3/Axl/Mertk (TAM). Using kidney transplant recipients with Ax/ gene deficiency, we further demonstrate that Axl augmented intragraft differentiation of proinflammatory macrophages, likely via its effect on the transcription factor Cebpb. This, in turn, promoted intragraft recruitment, differentiation, and proliferation of donor-specific T cells, and it enhanced early allograft inflammation evidenced by histology. We conclude that myeloid cell Ax/ expression identified by single cell transcriptomics of kidney allografts in our study plays a major role in promoting intragraft myeloid cell and T cell differentiation, and it presents a potentially novel therapeutic target for controlling kidney allograft rejection and improving kidney allograft survival.},

A decision tree explains to a patient the diagnosis with a long rule (i.e., conjunction of many intervals), while SHIMR employs a weighted sum of short rules. Using proteomics data of 151 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, SHIMR is shown to be as accurate as other non-interpretable methods (Sensitivity, SN = 0.84 +/- 0.1, Specificity, SP = 0.69 +/- 0.15 and Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.86 +/- 0.09). For clinical usage, SHIMR has a function to abstain from making any diagnosis when it is not confident enough, so that a medical doctor can choose more accurate but invasive and/or more costly pathologies. The incorporation of a rejection option complements SHIMR in designing a multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework. Using a baseline concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma proteins from a common cohort of 141 subjects, SHIMR is shown to be effective in designing a patient-specific cost-effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Thus, interpretability, reliability and having the potential to design a patient-specific multistage cost-effective diagnosis framework can make SHIMR serve as an indispensable tool in the era of precision medicine that can cater to the demand of both doctors and patients, and reduce the overwhelming financial burden of medical diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The analysis of leukocyte recruitment in intravital video microscopy (IVM) is essential to the understanding of inflammatory processes. However, because IVM images often present a large variety of visual characteristics, it is hard for an expert human or even conventional machine learning techniques to detect and count the massive amount of cells and extract statistical measures precisely. Convolutional neural networks are a promising approach to overcome this problem, but due to the difficulty of labeling cells, large data sets with ground truth are rare. The present work explores an adaptation of the RetinaNet model with a suite of augmentation techniques and transfer learning for detecting leukocytes in IVM data. The augmentation techniques include simulating the Airy pattern and motion artifacts present in microscopy imaging, followed by traditional photometric, geometric and smooth elastic transformations to reproduce color and shape changes in cells. In addition, we analyzed the use of different network backbones, feature pyramid levels, and image input scales. We have found that even with limited data, our strategy not only enables training without overfitting but also boosts generalization performance. Among several experiments, the model reached a value of 94.84 for the average precision (AP) metric as our best outcome when using data from different image modalities. We also compared our results with conventional image processing techniques and open-source tools. The results showed an outstanding precision of the method compared with other approaches, presenting low error rates for cell counting and centroid distances.

Although virtual reality may enhance digital human modeling, there is a knowledge gap on the combination of these technologies to assess ergonomics. This study aims to analyze the application of virtual reality and digital human modeling for physical ergonomics assessment during product development in the industry, through a review of patents and the literature. We searched the Derwent Innovation Index, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and found 250 patents and 18 articles. We observed an exponential increase in patents, concentrated among major technological players, and a wide range of technologies being invented. A significant number of studies focuses on the automotive and aviation industries. Despite a relative consensus in the literature on the benefits of integrating virtual reality and digital human modeling to assess physical ergonomics in the early stages of product development, the technologies are seldom combined in the same analysis; moreover, most cases continue to focus on analyzing pre-designed production processes, when resources are completely deployed. These outcomes may provide a reference for practitioners and researchers to develop novel solutions for the early detection of physical ergonomics issues in the industry.},

  abstract = {Patients and physicians make essential decisions regarding diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. These actions should be performed or deferred under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients' diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. This may lead to cognitive and judgment errors. Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that identifies a sequence of actions to increase the probability of achieving a predetermined goal. Reinforcement learning has the potential to assist in surgical decision making by recommending actions at predefined intervals and its ability to utilize complex input data, including text, image, and temporal data, in the decision-making process. The algorithm mimics a human trial-and-error learning process to calculate optimum recommendation policies. The article provides insight regarding challenges in the development and application of reinforcement learning in the medical field, with an emphasis on surgical decision making. The review focuses on challenges in formulating reward function describing the ultimate goal and determination of patient states derived from electronic health records, along with the lack of resources to simulate the potential benefits of suggested actions in response to changing physiological states during and after surgery. Although clinical implementation would require secure, interoperable, livestreaming electronic health record data for use by virtual model, development and validation of personalized reinforcement learning models in surgery can contribute to improving care by helping patients and clinicians make better decisions.

In this article, preliminary findings of a pilot study with five bipolar patients with respect to the acceptability and feasibility of the new approach are presented and discussed. There were individual differences in the usage frequency of the participants, and improvements regarding its handling were suggested. From the technical point of view, the video analysis was less dependable than the audio analysis and recognized almost exclusively the facial expressions of happiness. However, the system was feasible and well-accepted. The results indicate that further developments could facilitate the long-term analysis of expressed emotions in bipolar or other disorders without invading the privacy of patients.},

A systematic review of English articles using EMBASE, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Search terms included pregnancy and AI. Research articles and book chapters were included, while conference papers, editorials and notes were excluded from the review. Included papers focused on pregnancy and AI methods, and pertained to pharmacologic interventions. We identified 376 distinct studies from our queries. A final set of 31 papers were included for the review. Included papers represented a variety of pregnancy concerns and multidisciplinary applications of AI. Few studies relate to pregnancy, AI, and pharmacologics and therefore, we review carefully those studies. External validation of models and techniques described in the studies is limited, impeding on generalizability of the studies. Our review describes how AI has been applied to address maternal health, throughout the pregnancy process: preconception, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal health concerns. However, there is a lack of research applying AI methods to understand how pharmacologic treatments affect pregnancy. We identify three areas where AI methods could be used to improve our understanding of pharmacological effects of pregnancy, including: (a) obtaining sound and reliable data from clinical records (15 studies), (b) designing optimized animal experiments to validate specific hypotheses (1 study) to (c) implementing decision support systems that inform decision-making (11 studies). The largest literature gap that we identified is with regards to using AI methods to optimize translational studies between animals and humans for pregnancy-related drug exposures.},

Here we describe Manchester's involvement in the development of digital competency frameworks and our digital transformation education programmes that we have created, including a Massive Online Open Course and a professional development course for England's Topol Digital Fellows.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite at least 40 years of promising empirical performance, very few clinical natural language processing (NLP) or information extraction systems currently contribute to medical science or care. The authors address this gap by reducing the need for custom software and rules development with a graphical user interface-driven, highly generalizable approach to concept-level retrieval., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 'learn by example' approach combines features derived from open-source NLP pipelines with open-source machine learning classifiers to automatically and iteratively evaluate top-performing configurations. The Fourth i2b2/VA Shared Task Challenge's concept extraction task provided the data sets and metrics used to evaluate performance., RESULTS: Top F-measure scores for each of the tasks were medical problems (0.83), treatments (0.82), and tests (0.83). Recall lagged precision in all experiments. Precision was near or above 0.90 in all tasks. Discussion With no customization for the tasks and less than 5\hspace{0.25em}min of end-user time to configure and launch each experiment, the average F-measure was 0.83, one point behind the mean F-measure of the 22 entrants in the competition. Strong precision scores indicate the potential of applying the approach for more specific clinical information extraction tasks. There was not one best configuration, supporting an iterative approach to model creation., CONCLUSION: Acceptable levels of performance can be achieved using fully automated and generalizable approaches to concept-level information extraction. The described implementation and related documentation is available for download.},

Given the volume of data produced by such facilities astronomers will need fast, reliable, tools to informatively filter and classify incoming data in real time. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques with a hydrodynamical simulation training set to predict the kinematic behaviour of cold gas in galaxies and test these models on both simulated and real interferometric data. Using the power of a convolutional autoencoder we embed kinematic features, unattainable by the human eye or standard tools, into a 3D space and discriminate between disturbed and regularly rotating cold gas structures. Our simple binary classifier predicts the circularity of noiseless, simulated, galaxies with a recall of 85\% and performs as expected on observational CO and HI velocity maps, with a heuristic accuracy of 95\%. The model output exhibits predictable behaviour when varying the level of noise added to the input data and we are able to explain the roles of all dimensions of our mapped space. Our models also allow fast predictions of input galaxies' position angles with a 1 sigma uncertainty range of +/- 17 degrees to +/- 23 degrees (for galaxies with inclinations of 82.5 degrees to 32.5 degrees, respectively), which may be useful for initial parametrization in kinematic modelling samplers. Machine learning models, such as the one outlined in this paper, may be adapted for SKA science usage in the near future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined whether a context and process-sensitive 'intelligent' checklist increases compliance with best practice compared with a paper checklist during intensive care ward rounds., METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective before-and-after mixed-method trial in a 35 bed medical and surgical ICU. Daily ICU ward rounds were observed during two periods of 8 weeks. We compared paper checklists (control) with a dynamic (digital) clinical checklist (DCC, intervention). The primary outcome was compliance with best clinical practice, measured as the percentages of checked items and unchecked critical items. Secondary outcomes included ICU stay and the usability of digital checklists. Data are presented as median (interquartile range)., RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and severity of critical illness were similar during both control and intervention periods of study. A total of 36 clinicians visited 197 patients during 352 ward rounds using the paper checklist, compared with 211 patients during 366 ward rounds using the DCC. Per ICU round, a median of 100\% of items (94.4-100.0) were completed by DCC, compared with 75.1\% (66.7-86.4) by paper checklist (P=0.03). No critical items remained unchecked by the DCC, compared with 15.4\% (8.3-27.3) by the paper checklist (P=0.01). The DCC was associated with reduced ICU stay (1 day [1-3]), compared with the paper checklist (2 days [1-4]; P=0.05). Usability of the DCC was judged by clinicians to require further improvement., CONCLUSIONS: A digital checklist improved compliance with best clinical practice, compared with a paper checklist, during ward rounds on a mixed ICU., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03599856.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional screening procedures followed by regular nutrition monitoring for oncological outpatients are no standard practice in many European hospital wards and outpatient settings. As a result, early signs of malnutrition are missed and nutritional treatment is initiated when patients have already experienced severe weight loss., OBJECTIVE: We report on a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the global assessment and nutritional triage of the nutritional condition of oncology outpatients. The system combines clinical and laboratory data collected in the clinical setting with patient-generated data from a smartphone application for monitoring the patients' nutritional status. Our objective is to assess the feasibility of a CDSS that combines the aforementioned data sources and describe its integration into a hospital information system. Furthermore, we collected patients' opinions on the value of the system, and whether they would regard the system as a useful aid in coping with their condition., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system implements the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) to monitor nutritional status in the outpatient setting. A smartphone application is used to collect patient-generated data by performing weekly mini-surveys on patients concerning their eating habits, weight, and overall well-being. Data are uploaded on completion of each mini-survey and stored on a secure server at the Medical University of Vienna (MUV). The data are then combined with relevant clinical information from the Vienna General Hospital (VGH) information system. The knowledge base for the CDSS is implemented in medical logic modules (MLMs) using Arden Syntax. A three-month pilot clinical trial was performed to test the feasibility of the system. Qualitative questionnaires were used to obtain the patients' opinions on the usability and personal value of the system during the four-week test period., RESULTS: We used the existing separation between the scientific and clinical data domains in the secured network environment (SNE) at the MUV and VGH to our advantage by importing, storing, and processing both patient-generated and routine data in the scientific data domain. To limit exposure to the SNE, patient-generated data stored outside the SNE were imported to the scientific domain once a day. The CDSS created for nutritional assessment and triage comprised ten MLMs, each including either a sub-assessment or the final results of the PG-SGA. Finally, an interface created for the hospital information system showed the results directly in clinical routine. In all 22 patients completed the clinical study. The results of the questionnaires showed that 91\% of the patients were generally happy with the usability of the system, 91\% believed that the application was of additional value in detecting cancer-related malnutrition, and 82\% found it helpful as a long-term monitoring tool., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Despite strict protection of the clinical data domain, a CDSS employing patient-generated data can be integrated into clinical routine. The CDSS discussed in this report combined the information entered into a smartphone application with clinical data in order to inform the physician of a patient's nutritional status and thus permit suitable and timely intervention. The initial results show that the smartphone application was well accepted by patients, who considered it useful, but not many oncological outpatients were willing to participate in the clinical study because they did not possess an Android phone or lacked smartphone expertise. Furthermore, the results indicate that patient-generated data could be employed to augment clinical data and calculate metrics such as the PG-SGA without excessive effort by using a secure intermediate location as the locus of data storage and processing.

However, building fair models may be only half the challenge. A seemingly fair model could involve, directly or indirectly, what we call "latent biases." Just as latent errors are generally described as errors "waiting to happen" in complex systems, latent biases are biases waiting to happen. Here we describe 3 major challenges related to bias in AI algorithms and propose several ways of managing them. There is an urgent need to address latent biases before the widespread implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract = {During the last decade, studies have shown the benefits of using clinical guidelines in the practice of medicine. Although the importance of these guidelines is widely recognized, health care organizations typically pay more attention to guideline development than to guideline implementation for routine use in daily care. However, studies have shown that clinicians are often not familiar with written guidelines and do not apply them appropriately during the actual care process. Implementing guidelines in computer-based decision support systems promises to improve the acceptance and application of guidelines in daily practice because the actions and observations of health care workers are monitored and advice is generated whenever a guideline is not followed. Such implementations are increasingly applied in diverse areas such as policy development, utilization management, education, clinical trials, and workflow facilitation. Many parties are developing computer-based guidelines as well as decision support systems that incorporate these guidelines. This paper reviews generic approaches for developing and implementing computer-based guidelines that facilitate decision support.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To implement practice guideline entry tools in a reminder system in order to provide decision support to health care workers in clinical care and emergency care environments. To design a knowledge acquisition environment that enables physicians to formulate, update, and verify guidelines without the assistance of a knowledge engineer., METHODS: We developed a knowledge acquisition environment for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) consisting of 1) a graphical knowledge acquisition tool, 2) tools that perform logical and semantic tests on proposed guidelines, 3) a Patient Data Management System (PDMS) containing clinical patient data, and 4) an expert system that reminds ICU health care workers of inconsistencies between a treatment plan and implemented guidelines. Physicians enter the guidelines using the knowledge acquisition tool, after which consistency and correctness tests are performed on the guidelines. The guidelines are then transferred to the knowledge base of the reminder system and validated by applying the new guidelines to a large stored data set of previous patients. If the new guidelines are approved, they are exported to the reminder system that is used in daily practice., RESULTS: ICU physicians used the knowledge acquisition tool to enter 58 guidelines into the reminder system's knowledge base. These guidelines were tested on a data set consisting of 803 previously admitted patients. As a result, 27 guidelines fired at least once, generating 406 reminders in total. Of the 406 generated reminders, 356 (88\%) were issued correctly and 50 (12\%) were false alarms. The reminders that were issued correctly involved 3 situations: 1) the database contained inconsistent or incomplete information, 2) the actions or decisions of the health care workers were not the most appropriate ones, and 3) there was a potential risk involved. All false alarms were caused by the fact that the corresponding guidelines were not specific enough to handle certain exceptions. As a result of this analysis, the guidelines could be improved in such a way as to eliminate all false alarms., CONCLUSIONS: These first results demonstrate that this bottom-up knowledge acquisition strategy, implemented by the automated knowledge acquisition tools, enables medical specialists to improve the quality of computer support in an ICU without assistance of a knowledge engineer.},

However, before the technology’s possibilities can be fully harnessed, certain constraints must be overcome. This study identifies the benefits and challenges of virtual-reality-based usability testing and design reviews in industry through a patents and articles review. We searched Derwent Innovation, Scopus, and Web of Science and identified 7 patent filings and 20 articles. We discovered an increase in patent filings since 2016 and strong development in the technology space, offering opportunities to enter an area while it is still young. The most frequently researched field is the automotive industry and the most used device is the HTC VIVE head-mounted display, which is frequently paired with motion capture systems and Unity 3D game engines. Virtual reality benefits design reviews and usability testing by providing the visualization of new angles that stimulate novel insights, increasing team engagement, offering more intuitive interactions for non-CAD specialists, saving redesign cost and time, and increasing participants’ safety. The challenges faced by virtual-reality-based prototypes are a lack of realism due to unnatural tactile and visual interactions, latency and registration issues, communication difficulties between teams, and unpleasant symptoms. While these constraints prevent virtual reality from replacing conventional design reviews and usability testing in the near future, it is already a valuable contribution to the industrial product development process.},

A three-level model of knowledge representation is proposed that includes a contextual, a conceptual and a computational level.

  abstract = {Machine learning applications for personalized medicine are highly dependent on access to sufficient data. For personalized radiation oncology, datasets representing the variation in the entire cancer patient population need to be acquired and used to learn prediction models. Ethical and legal boundaries to ensure data privacy hamper collaboration between research institutes. We hypothesize that data sharing is possible without identifiable patient data leaving the radiation clinics and that building machine learning applications on distributed datasets is feasible. We developed and implemented an IT infrastructure in five radiation clinics across three countries (Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands). We present here a proof-of-principle for future 'big data' infrastructures and distributed learning studies. Lung cancer patient data was collected in all five locations and stored in local databases. Exemplary support vector machine (SVM) models were learned using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) from the distributed databases to predict post-radiotherapy dyspnea grade 2. The discriminative performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) in a five-fold cross-validation (learning on four sites and validating on the fifth). The performance of the distributed learning algorithm was compared to centralized learning where datasets of all institutes are jointly analyzed. The euroCAT infrastructure has been successfully implemented in five radiation clinics across three countries. SVM models can be learned on data distributed over all five clinics. Furthermore, the infrastructure provides a general framework to execute learning algorithms on distributed data. The ongoing expansion of the euroCAT network will facilitate machine learning in radiation oncology. The resulting access to larger datasets with sufficient variation will pave the way for generalizable prediction models and personalized medicine.Copyright © 2016 The Authors},

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: With the advent of digital technology and specifically user-generated contents in social media, new ways emerged for studying possible stigma of people in relation with mental health. Several pieces of work studied the discourse conveyed about psychiatric pathologies on Twitter considering mostly tweets in English and a limited number of psychiatric disorders terms. This paper proposes the first study to analyze the use of a wide range of psychiatric terms in tweets in French. Objective: Our aim is to study how generic, nosographic, and therapeutic psychiatric terms are used on Twitter in French. More specifically, our study has 3 complementary goals: (1) to analyze the types of psychiatric word use (medical, misuse, or irrelevant), (2) to analyze the polarity conveyed in the tweets that use these terms (positive, negative, or neural), and (3) to compare the frequency of these terms to those observed in related work (mainly in English). Methods: Our study was conducted on a corpus of tweets in French posted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, and collected using dedicated keywords. The corpus was manually annotated by clinical psychiatrists following a multilayer annotation scheme that includes the type of word use and the opinion orientation of the tweet. A qualitative analysis was performed to measure the reliability of the produced manual annotation, and then a quantitative analysis was performed considering mainly term frequency in each layer and exploring the interactions between them. Results: One of the first results is a resource as an annotated dataset. The initial dataset is composed of 22,579 tweets in French containing at least one of the selected psychiatric terms. From this set, experts in psychiatry randomly annotated 3040 tweets that corresponded to the resource resulting from our work. The second result is the analysis of the annotations showing that terms are misused in 45.33\% (1378/3040) of the tweets and that their associated polarity is negative in 86.21\% (1188/1378) of the cases. When considering the 3 types of term use, 52.14\% (1585/3040) of the tweets are associated with a negative polarity. Misused terms related to psychotic disorders (721/1300, 55.46\%) were more frequent to those related to depression (15/280, 5.4\%). Conclusions: Some psychiatric terms are misused in the corpora we studied, which is consistent with the results reported in related work in other languages. Thanks to the great diversity of studied terms, this work highlighted a disparity in the representations and ways of using psychiatric terms. Moreover, our study is important to help psychiatrists to be aware of the term use in new communication media such as social networks that are widely used. This study has the huge advantage to be reproducible thanks to the framework and guidelines we produced so that the study could be renewed in order to analyze the evolution of term usage. While the newly build dataset is a valuable resource for other analytical studies, it could also serve to train machine learning algorithms to automatically identify stigma in social media.},

Infobuttons are information retrieval tools that help clinicians to fulfill their information needs by providing links to on-line health information resources from within an electronic medical record (EMR) system. The aim of this study was to produce classification models based on medication infobutton usage data to predict the medication-related content topics (e.g., dose, adverse effects, drug interactions, patient education) that a clinician is most likely to choose while entering medication orders in a particular clinical context., DESIGN: We prepared a dataset with 3078 infobutton sessions and 26 attributes describing characteristics of the user, the medication, and the patient. In these sessions, users selected one out of eight content topics. Automatic attribute selection methods were then applied to the dataset to eliminate redundant and useless attributes. The reduced dataset was used to produce nine classification models from a set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Finally, the performance of the models was measured and compared., MEASUREMENTS: Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and agreement (kappa) between the content topics predicted by the models and those chosen by clinicians in each infobutton session., RESULTS: The performance of the models ranged from 0.49 to 0.56 (kappa). The AUC of the best model ranged from 0.73 to 0.99. The best performance was achieved when predicting choice of the adult dose, pediatric dose, patient education, and pregnancy category content topics., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that classification models based on infobutton usage data are a promising method for the prediction of content topics that a clinician would choose to answer patient care questions while using an EMR system.},

  abstract = {Objective: Some cases are thought to be more complex and difficult to treat, although there is little consensus on how to define complexity in psychological care. This study proposes an actuarial, data-driven method of identifying complex cases based on their individual characteristics. Method: Clinical records for 1512 patients accessing low and high intensity psychological treatments were partitioned in 2 random subsamples. Prognostic indices (PI) predicting post-treatment reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms were estimated in one subsample using penalized (Lasso) regressions with optimal scaling. A PI-based algorithm was used to classify patients as standard (St) or complex (Cx) cases in the second (cross-validation) subsample. RCSI rates were compared between Cx cases that accessed treatments of different intensities using logistic regression. Results: St cases had significantly higher RCSI rates compared to Cx cases (OR = 1.81 to 2.81). Cx cases tended to attain better depression outcomes if they were initially assigned to high intensity (vs. low intensity) interventions (OR = 2.23); a similar pattern was observed for anxiety but the odds ratio (1.74) was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Complex cases could be detected early and matched to high intensity interventions to improve outcomes.},

Several psychological interventions are available, but there is a lack of evidence to decide which treatment works best for whom. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients who respond differentially to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or person-centred counselling for depression (CfD). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of archival routine practice data for 1435 patients who received either CBT (N=1104) or CfD (N=331) in primary care. The main outcome was post-treatment reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in the PHQ-9 depression measure. A targeted prescription algorithm was developed in a training sample (N=1085) using a supervised machine learning approach (elastic net with optimal scaling). The clinical utility of the algorithm was examined in a statistically independent test sample (N=350) using chi-square analysis and odds ratios. Results: Cases in the test sample that received their modelRC“I (41.7\%); x2 (DF = 1) = 4.79, p = .03, OR = 2.33 (95\% CI = 1.09, 5.02).

Based on the data collected from the workshops, six AR and VR use-cases were defined: stakeholder engagement, design support, design review, construction support, operations and management support, and training. Three main research categories for a future research agenda have been proposed, i.e.: (i) engineering-grade devices, which encompasses research that enables robust devices that can be used in practice, e.g. the rough and complex conditions of construction sites; (ii) workflow and data management; to effectively manage data and processes required by AR and VR technologies; and (iii) new capabilities; which includes new research required that will add new features that are necessary for the specific construction industry demands. This study provides essential information for practitioners to inform adoption decisions. To researchers, it provides a research road map to inform their future research efforts.

Such an algorithmic approach may provide a useful adjunct for a rapid and accurate diagnosis of a glioma. The aim of this study is to devise a machine learning algorithm that may be used by radiologists in routine practice to aid diagnosis of both: WHO grade and IDH mutation status in de novo gliomas. To evaluate the status quo, we interrogated the accuracy of neuroradiology reports in relation to WHO grade: grade II 96.49\% (95\% confidence intervals [CI] 0.88, 0.99); III 36.51\% (95\% CI 0.24, 0.50); IV 72.9\% (95\% CI 0.67, 0.78). We derived five MRI parameters from the same diagnostic brain scans, in under two minutes per case, and then supplied these data to a random forest algorithm. Machine learning resulted in a high level of accuracy in prediction of tumour grade: grade II/III; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 98\%, sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.94; grade II/IV; AUC = 100\%, sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 1.0; grade III/IV; AUC = 97\%, sensitivity = 0.83, specificity = 0.97. Furthermore, machine learning also facilitated the discrimination of IDH status: AUC of 88\%, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.77. These data demonstrate the ability of machine learning to accurately classify diffuse gliomas by both WHO grade and IDH status from routine MRI alone-without significant image processing, which may facilitate usage as a diagnostic adjunct in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mode of delivery is one of the issues that most concerns obstetricians. The caesarean section rate has increased progressively in recent years, exceeding the limit recommended by health institutions. Obstetricians generally lack the necessary technology to help them decide whether a caesarean delivery is appropriate based on antepartum and intrapartum conditions., METHODS: In this study, we have tested the suitability of using three popular artificial intelligence algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron and, Random Forest, to develop a clinical decision support system for the prediction of the mode of delivery according to three categories: caesarean section, euthocic vaginal delivery and, instrumental vaginal delivery. For this purpose, we used a comprehensive clinical database consisting of 25,038 records with 48 attributes of women who attended to give birth at the Service of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University Clinical Hospital "Virgen de la Arrixaca" in the Murcia Region (Spain) from January of 2016 to January 2019. Women involved were patients with singleton pregnancies who attended to the emergency room on active labour or undergoing a planned induction of labour for medical reasons., RESULTS: The three implemented algorithms showed a similar performance, all of them reaching an accuracy equal to or above 90\% in the classification between caesarean and vaginal deliveries and somewhat lower, around 87\% between instrumental and euthocic., CONCLUSIONS: The results validate the use of these algorithms to build a clinical decision system to help gynaecologists to predict the mode of delivery.

  abstract = {In the context of the global health crisis of 2020, the tendency of many people to self-diagnose at home virtually, prior to any physical interaction with medical professionals, has been increased. Existing self-diagnosis systems include those accessible via the Internet, which involve entering one's symptoms. Several other methods do exist, for example, people read medical blogs or notes, which are often wrongly interpreted by them and they arrive at a completely different assumption regarding the cause of their symptoms. In this paper, a system called HealthCloud is proposed, for monitoring health status of heart patients using machine learning and cloud computing. This study aims to offer the best of both worlds', by combining the information required for the person to understand the disease in sufficient detail, with an accurate prediction as to whether they may have (in this case) heart disease or not. The presence of heart disease is predicted using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Trees. This paper evaluates these machine learning algorithms to obtain the most accurate model, in compliance with Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The performance of these machine learning models is measured and compared using the metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity, AUC scores, Execution Time, Latency, and Memory Usage. For better establishment of the results, these machine learning algorithms have been cross validated with 5-fold cross validation technique. With an accuracy rate of 85.96\%, it has been found that Logistic Regression is the most responsive and accurate model amongst those models assessed. The Precision, Recall, Cross Validation mean and AUC Score for this model were 95.83\%, 76.67\%, 81.68\% and 96\% respectively. The algorithm and the mobile application were tested on Google Cloud Firebase with existing user inputs from the dataset, as well as with unseen new data. The use of this system can assist patients, both in reaching self-diagnosis decisions and in monitoring their health.},

  abstract = {The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.},

Integrating patients data with clinical trials data is enormously promising as it provides a comprehensive knowledge base that accelerates the clinical research response-ability to tackle emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This work introduces EMR2vec, a platform that customises advanced NLP, machine learning and semantic web techniques to link potential patients to suitable clinical trials. Linking these two different but complementary datasets allows clinicians and researchers to compare patients to clinical research opportunities or to automatically select patients for personalized clinical care. The platform derives a 'bag of medical terms' (BoMT) from eligibility criteria by normalizing extracted entities through SNOMED-CT ontology. With the usage of BoMT, an ontological reasoning method is proposed to represent EMR and clinical trials in a vector space model. The platform presents a matching process that reduces vector dimensionality using a neural network, then applies orthogonality projection to measure the similarity between vectors. Finally, the proposed EMR2vec platform is evaluated with an extendable prototype based on Big data tools.},

  abstract = {Although advances in information technology in the past decade have come in quantum leaps in nearly every aspect of our lives, they seem to be coming at a slower pace in the field of medicine. However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare \& Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting "alert fatigue" and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of "big data" in health care provide the potential not only to perform "in silico" research but also to provide "real time" diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. "On demand" access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine. The combination of AI, big data, and massively parallel computing offers the potential to create a revolutionary way of practicing evidence-based, personalized medicine. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Implementation of machine learning (ML) may be limited by patients' right to "meaningful information about the logic involved" when ML influences healthcare decisions. Given the complexity of healthcare decisions, it is likely that ML outputs will need to be understood and trusted by physicians, and then explained to patients. We therefore investigated the association between physician understanding of ML outputs, their ability to explain these to patients, and their willingness to trust the ML outputs, using various ML explainability methods., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a survey for physicians with a diagnostic dilemma that could be resolved by an ML risk calculator. Physicians were asked to rate their understanding, explainability, and trust in response to 3 different ML outputs. One ML output had no explanation of its logic (the control) and 2 ML outputs used different model-agnostic explainability methods. The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association., RESULTS: The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13\%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P {$<$} .001), between physician understanding and trust (P {$<$} .001), and between explainability and trust (P {$<$} .001). ML outputs that used model-agnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88\% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular ML explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior., CONCLUSIONS: Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in ML risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred ML outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract = {The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem aims at finding a longest string that is a subsequence of each string from a given set of input strings. This problem has applications, in particular, in the context of bioinformatics, where strings represent DNA or protein sequences. Existing approaches include numerous heuristics, but only a few exact approaches, limited to rather small problem instances. Adopting various aspects from leading heuristics for the LCS, we first propose an exact A* search approach, which performs well in comparison to earlier exact approaches in the context of small instances. On the basis of A* search we then develop two hybrid A*-based algorithms in which classical A* iterations are alternated with beam search and anytime column search, respectively. A key feature to guide the heuristic search in these approaches is the usage of an approximate expected length calculation for the LCS of uniform random strings. Even for large problem instances these anytime A* variants yield reasonable solutions early during the search and improve on them over time. Moreover, they terminate with proven optimality if enough time and memory is given. Furthermore, they yield upper bounds and, thus, quality guarantees when terminated early. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed methods using most of the available benchmark sets from the literature and compare to the current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithms are able to obtain new best results for 82 out of 117 instance groups. Moreover, in most cases they also provide significantly smaller optimality gaps than other anytime algorithms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the impact of a decision support system on the quality of recorded diagnoses and the completeness of medical records. The assumption is that for quality assessment purposes enough data have to be recorded in an electronic medical record so that diagnostic decisions can be justified. The hypotheses were tested that active decision support will lead to better quality recorded diagnoses and more complete medical records. Three groups of ten GPs were presented with 10 cases each. The GPs had to enter the data about these cases in a GP information system. One group of GPs was not supported. The second group was presented with the ICHPPC-II-Defined criteria that had to be fulfilled when a diagnosis was entered. In a third group, the GPs were asked those data that were needed to justify an entered diagnosis (active support). It could be shown that the last group of GPs entered better quality diagnoses than the other two groups. These latter groups also entered so little data that most of their diagnoses could not be justified. It is concluded from the study that only active decision support will lead to better diagnoses and a more complete medical record that can be used for quality assessment.},

They are powerful tools for large scale data analysis, prediction and classification, especially in very data-rich environments (“big data”), and have started to find their way into medical applications. Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.},

From that point, the environmental issues from the analysis of exhaustible and productive resources to its economic role and consequentially its impact, were examined. Environment affects must be considered as human activity-based processes which repercussions effect economy in general. Thus, the long-term decision-making processes in economy must take into account future generations as well. Furthermore, tourism as an economic activity is growing rapidly and one must take into consideration, that it is based on, primarily, natural environment and man-made resources. Degradation of basic tourism resources can lead to decrease of tourism demand. Therefore, the analysis of environmental impact on tourism, and vice versa, the impact of tourism on environment is crucial. With the development of information technology sector, new and innovative methods for analysis and forecasting have emerged such as artificial intelligence. The main hypothesis of this paper is to research how artificial intelligence can contribute to analysis and investigating environmental aspect of tourism. Therefore, the paper provides a theoretical overview of possible fields of artificial intelligence usage in sustainability, in the context of tourism development.},

The meta-analysis was based on 1600 observations on 21 relationships coded from 162 prior studies on IS/IT acceptance and use. The SEM analysis showed that attitude: was central to behavioural intentions and usage behaviours, partially mediated the effects of exogenous constructs on behavioural intentions, and had a direct influence on usage behaviours.

  abstract = {Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 uses for entry into host cells a receptor (CD4) and one of two co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4). Recently, a new class of antiretroviral drugs has entered clinical practice that specifically bind to the co-receptor CCR5, and thus inhibit virus entry. Accurate prediction of the co-receptor used by the virus in the patient is important as it allows for personalized selection of effective drugs and prognosis of disease progression. We have investigated whether it is possible to predict co-receptor usage accurately by analyzing the amino acid sequence of the main determinant of co-receptor usage, i.e., the third variable loop V3 of the gp120 protein. We developed a two-level machine learning approach that in the first level considers two different properties important for protein- protein binding derived from structural models of V3 and V3 sequences. The second level combines the two predictions of the first level. The two-level method predicts usage of CXCR4 co-receptor for new V3 sequences within seconds, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.937 +/- 0.004. Moreover, it is relatively robust against insertions and deletions, which frequently occur in V3. The approach could help clinicians to find optimal personalized treatments, and it offers new insights into the molecular basis of co-receptor usage. For instance, it quantifies the importance for co-receptor usage of a pocket that probably is responsible for binding sulfated tyrosine.},

  abstract = {Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.Copyright © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

  abstract = {Individuals with psychiatric disorders are vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes following physical illness. This longitudinal cohort study defined risk profiles for readmission for suicidal behavior and self-harm after general hospitalization of adults with serious mental illness. Structured electronic health record data were analyzed from 15,644 general non-psychiatric index hospitalizations of individuals with depression, bipolar, and psychotic disorders admitted to an urban health system in the southwestern United States between 2006 and 2017. Using data from one-year prior to and including index hospitalization, supervised machine learning was implemented to predict risk of readmission for suicide attempt and self-harm in the following year. The Classification and Regression Tree algorithm produced a classification prediction with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.97). Incidence of suicide-related behavior was highest after general non-psychiatric hospitalizations of individuals with prior suicide attempt or self-harm (18\%; 69 cases/389 hospitalizations) and lowest after hospitalizations associated with very high medical morbidity burden (0 cases/3090 hospitalizations). Predictor combinations, rather than single risk factors, explained the majority of risk, including concomitant alcohol use disorder with moderate medical morbidity, and age {$<$}=55-years-old with low medical morbidity. Findings suggest that applying an efficient and highly interpretable machine learning algorithm to electronic health record data may inform general hospital clinical decision support, resource allocation, and preventative interventions for medically ill adults with serious mental illness.

Most patients referred from primary to secondary care are done so using the existing '2 weeks wait' (2ww) pathway. Method(s): Data relating to 2ww referral of patients with suspected head \& neck cancer referred to 2 large tertiary referral centres in the UK were collated both prospectively and retrospectively. The combined dataset was subjected to analysis via a variety of machine learning techniques using kfold cross validation to facilitate risk stratification. Type II errors were minimised using class weighting and manipulation of posterior probabilities. Result(s): Over 5000 patient entries were analysed. On a 10\% validation corpus we repeatably demonstrate that 26\% of patients referred with signs or symptoms of suspected head \& neck cancer could have been safely managed out with the 2 week wait referral pathway, with minimal ({$<$}1/ 1000 chance) risk of a false negative ascribed non-cancer diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Our techniques in this setting demonstrate the rationale for utilising a data rich, machine learning based tool to provide safe and accurate decision support in the management of patients with potential head and neck cancer diagnosis. It follows that use of such a tool could potentially lead to significant cost savings in the management of these referrals from primary to secondary care, however its implementation will need to be very carefully managed alongside appropriate quality assurance measures and changes to existing patient management pathways.},

  abstract = {Life expectancy is rising in most parts of the world as is the prevalence of chronic diseases. Suboptimal adherence to long-term medications is still rather the norm than the exception, although it is well known that suboptimal adherence compromises the therapeutic effectiveness. Information and communications technology provides new concepts for improving adherence to medications. These so-called telehealth concepts or services help to implement closed-loop healthcare paradigms and to establish collaborative care networks involving all stakeholders relevant to optimising the overall medication therapy. Together with data from Electronic Health Records and Electronic Medical Records, these networks pave the way to data-driven decision support systems. Recent advances in machine learning, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence allow further steps towards fully autonomous telehealth systems. This might bring advances in the future: disburden healthcare professionals from repetitive tasks, enable them to timely react to critical situations, and offer a comprehensive overview of the patients' medication status. Advanced analytics can help to assess whether patients have taken their medications as prescribed, to improve adherence via automatic reminders. Ultimately, all relevant data sources need to be collated into a basis for data-driven methods, with the goal to assist healthcare professionals in guiding patients to obtain the best possible health status, with a reasonable resource utilisation and a risk-adjusted safety and privacy approach.

  abstract = {The use of cloud services that process privacy-sensitive information such as digital banking, pervasive healthcare, smart home applications requires an implicit continuous authentication solution, which will make these systems less vulnerable to the spoofing attacks. Physiological signals can be used for continuous authentication due to their uniqueness. Ubiquitous wrist-worn wearable devices are equipped with photoplethysmogram sensors, which enable us to extract heart rate variability (HRV) features. In this study, we show that these devices can be used for continuous physiological authentication for enhancing the security of the cloud, edge services, and IoT devices. A system that is suitable for the smartband framework comes with new challenges such as relatively low signal quality and artifacts due to placement, which were not encountered in full lead electrocardiogram systems. After the artifact removal, cleaned physiological signals are fed to the machine learning algorithms. In order to train our machine learning models, we collected physiological data using off-the-shelf smartbands and smartwatches in a real-life event. By applying a minimum quality threshold, we achieved a 3.96\% Equal Error Rate. Performance evaluation shows that HRV is a strong candidate for continuous unobtrusive implicit physiological authentication.},

  abstract = {Critical technique errors are very often performed by patients in the use of Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) resulting in a reduction of the clinical efficiency of such medication. Those critical errors include: pure inhalation, non-arming of the device, no exhalation before or after inhalation, and non-holding of breath for 5-10 s between inhalation and exhalation. In this work, an audio-based classification method that assesses patient DPI user technique is presented by extracting the the non-silent audio segments and categorizing them into respiratory sounds. Twenty healthy and non-healthy volunteers used the same placebo inhaler (Bretaris Genuair Inhaler) in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The audio-based method achieved an F1-score of 89.87\% in classifying sound events (Actuation, Inhale, Button Press, and Exhale). The significance of the algorithm lies not just on automatic classification but on a post-processing step of peak detection that resulted in an improvement of 5.58\% on the F1-score, reaching 94.85\%. This method can provide a clinically accurate assessment of the patient's inhaler use without the supervision of a doctor.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has revolutionized medical diagnosis, particularly for cancers. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosis is a tedious protocol that is prone to human and machine errors. In several instances, it is difficult to make an accurate final decision even after careful examination by an experienced pathologist. However, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can help reduce the errors and time associated with AML diagnosis. White Blood Cells (WBC) detection is a critical step in AML diagnosis, and deep learning is considered a state-of-the-art approach for WBC detection. However, the accuracy of WBC detection is strongly associated with the quality of the extracted features used in training the pixel-wise classification models. CAD depends on studying the different patterns of changes associated with WBC counts and features. In this study, a new hybrid feature extraction method was developed using image processing and deep learning methods. The proposed method consists of two steps: 1) a region of interest (ROI) is extracted using the CMYK-moment localization method and 2) deep learning-based features are extracted using a CNN-based feature fusion method. Several classification algorithms are used to evaluate the significance of the extracted features. The proposed feature extraction method was evaluated using an external dataset and benchmarked against other feature extraction methods. The proposed method achieved excellent performance, generalization, and stability using all the classifiers, with overall classification accuracies of 97.57\% and 96.41\% using the primary and secondary datasets, respectively. This method has opened a new alternative to improve the detection of WBCs, which could lead to a better diagnosis of AML.},

  abstract = {Background. Timely selection of adequate empiric antibiotics has become increasingly difficult due to rising resistance rates and the competing desire to apply antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) principles. Individualized clinical prediction models offer the promise of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use and preserving/improving adequacy of treatment, but few have been validated in the clinical setting. Methods. Multivariable models were used to predict the probability of susceptibility for gram-negative (GN) bacteria in bloodstream infections (bacteremia) to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem. The models were combined with existing resistance-prediction methods to generate optimized and individualized suggestions for empiric therapy that were provided to prescribers by an AMS pharmacist. De-escalation of empiric antibiotics and adequacy of therapy were analyzed using a quasi-experimental design comparing two 9-month periods (pre- and postintervention) at a large academic tertiary care institution. Results. Episodes of bacteremia (n = 182) were identified in the preintervention and postintervention (n = 201) periods. Patients who received the intervention were more likely to have their therapy de-escalated (29 vs 21\%; aOR = 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.87; P = .02). The intervention also increased the proportion of patients who were on the narrowest adequate therapy at the time of culture finalization (44\% in the control and 55\% in the intervention group; aOR = 2.04; 95\% CI, 1.27-3.27; P = .003). Time to adequate therapy was similar in the intervention and control groups (5 vs 4 hours; P = .95). Conclusions. An AMS intervention, based on individualized predictive models for resistance, can influence empiric antibiotic selections for GN bacteremia to facilitate early de-escalation of therapy without compromising adequacy of antibiotic coverage.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The paper proposes that AI is facing an epistemological and methodological crisis inherited from psychology based on dualist ontology. The roots of this crisis lie in the duality between rationalism and objectivism or in the mind-body rupture that has governed the production of scientific thought and the proliferation of approaches. In addition, by highlighting the sociohistorical conditions of AI, this paper investigates the historical characteristics of the shift of the crisis from psychology to AI. Additionally, we examine the epistemological and methodological roots of the main challenges encountered in AI research by noting that empiricism is the dominant tendency in the field. Empiricism gives rise to methodological and practical challenges, including challenges related to the emergence of meaning, abstraction, generalization, the emergence of symbols, concept formation, functional reflection of reality, and the emergence of higher psychological functions. Furthermore, through discussing attempts to formalize dialectical logic, the paper, based on contradiction formation, proposes a qualitative epistemological, methodological, and formal alternative by using a preliminary algorithmic model that grasps the formation of meaning as an essential ability for the qualitative reflection of reality and the emergence of other mental functions.},

Since modern AI's inception decades ago, practitioners in radiological sciences have been pioneering its development and implementation in medicine, particularly in areas related to diagnostic imaging and therapy. In this anniversary article, we embark on a journey to reflect on the learned lessons from past AI's chequered history. We further summarize the current status of AI in radiological sciences, highlighting, with examples, its impressive achievements and effect on re-shaping the practice of medical imaging and radiotherapy in the areas of computer-aided detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and decision support.

However, there has been little research on the feasibility and efficacy of integrating AI systems into real-world clinical practice, especially from the perspectives of clinicians who use such tools. In this paper, we review physicians' perceptions of and satisfaction with an AI tool, Watson for Oncology, which is used for the treatment of cancer. Watson for Oncology has been implemented in several different settings, including Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. By focusing on the implementation of an AI-based clinical decision support system for oncology, we aim to demonstrate how AI can be both beneficial and challenging for cancer management globally and particularly for low-middle-income countries. By doing so, we hope to highlight the need for additional research on user experience and the unique social, cultural, and political barriers to the successful implementation of AI in low-middle-income countries for cancer care.Copyright © Srinivas Emani, Angela Rui, Hermano Alexandre Lima Rocha, Rubina F Rizvi, Sergio Ferreira Juacaba, Gretchen Purcell Jackson, David W Bates.},

However, calculating joint loading relies on the performance of an extensive biomechanical analysis, which is not possible to do in a free-living situation. We propose the concept and design of a novel blended-care app called JOLO (Joint Load) that combines free-living information on activity with lab-based measures of joint loading in order to estimate a subject's functional status. (2) Method: We used an iterative design process to evaluate the usability of the JOLO app through questionnaires. The user interfaces that resulted from the iterations are described and provide a concept for feedback on functional status. (3) Results: In total, 44 people (20 people with OA and 24 health-care providers) participated in the testing of the JOLO app. OA patients rated the latest version of the JOLO app as moderately useful. Therapists were predominantly positive; however, their intention to use JOLO was low due to technological issues. (4) Conclusion: We can conclude that JOLO is promising, but further technological improvements concerning activity recognition, the development of personalized joint loading predictions and a more comfortable means to carry the device are needed to facilitate its integration as a blended-care program.},

Focusing on the objects of cognition calls attention to differences across medical work settings. There is an interconnection between the type of the object encountered, the physician's generalized conception of the object, and the physician's choice of linearization or lateralization as cognitive strategy. In a consultation the object of medical cognition is locally constructed through a series of mediated actions. Identification of contradictions at the level of the institutional activity system is crucial for the understanding of failures and innovations in actions of medical cognition. A conceptual model for analyzing such contradictions is presented. It is demonstrated that medical cognition is a collaborative achievement between the physician and the patient. Patients use a variety of strategies to turn their experienced health problems into manageable problems. The patient's strategy can and often does influence the physician's strategy and the outcome of the consultation.},

Thus, many technology companies have invested in producing AI clinical applications. Patients are one of the most important beneficiaries who potentially interact with these technologies and applications; thus, patients' perceptions may affect the widespread use of clinical AI. Patients should be ensured that AI clinical applications will not harm them, and that they will instead benefit from using AI technology for health care purposes. Although human-AI interaction can enhance health care outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care. Objective: The main objective of this study was to examine how potential users (patients) perceive the benefits, risks, and use of AI clinical applications for their health care purposes and how their perceptions may be different if faced with three health care service encounter scenarios. Methods: We designed a 2x3 experiment that crossed a type of health condition (ie, acute or chronic) with three different types of clinical encounters between patients and physicians (ie, AI clinical applications as substituting technology, AI clinical applications as augmenting technology, and no AI as a traditional in-person visit). We used an online survey to collect data from 634 individuals in the United States. Results: The interactions between the types of health care service encounters and health conditions significantly influenced individuals' perceptions of privacy concerns, trust issues, communication barriers, concerns about transparency in regulatory standards, liability risks, benefits, and intention to use across the six scenarios. We found no significant differences among scenarios regarding perceptions of performance risk and social biases. Conclusions: The results imply that incompatibility with instrumental, technical, ethical, or regulatory values can be a reason for rejecting AI applications in health care. Thus, there are still various risks associated with implementing AI applications in diagnostics and treatment recommendations for patients with both acute and chronic illnesses. The concerns are also evident if the AI applications are used as a recommendation system under physician experience, wisdom, and control. Prior to the widespread rollout of AI, more studies are needed to identify the challenges that may raise concerns for implementing and using AI applications. This study could provide researchers and managers with critical insights into the determinants of individuals' intention to use AI clinical applications. Regulatory agencies should establish normative standards and evaluation guidelines for implementing AI in health care in cooperation with health care institutions. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI clinical applications.},

This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States., RESULTS: The proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs., CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare.

From our own experience and the literature, we share several lessons for developing such models in settings where the data necessary for algorithm training and implementation is a limited resource. First, the training cohort should be as similar as possible to the population of interest, and recalibration can be used to improve risk estimates when a model is transported to a new context. Second, algorithms should incorporate existing data sources or data that is easily obtainable by frontline health workers or assistants in order to optimize available resources and facilitate integration into clinical practice. Third, the Super Learner ensemble machine learning algorithm can be used to define the optimal model for a given prediction problem while minimizing bias in the algorithm selection process. By considering the right population, right resources, and right algorithm, researchers can train prediction models that are both context-appropriate and resource-conscious. There remain gaps in data availability, affordable computing capacity, and implementation studies that hinder clinical algorithm development and use in low-resource settings, although these barriers are decreasing over time. We advocate for researchers to create open-source code, apps, and training materials to allow new machine learning models to be adapted to different populations and contexts in order to support surgical providers and health care systems in low- and middle-income countries worldwide.

With the soaring cost of healthcare, particularly in the US, there is a critical need for cutting costs of diagnostic tests, while achieving a higher level of diagnostic accuracy. This paper develops a learning based methodology that, based on patient information, recommends test(s) that optimize a suitable measure of diagnostic performance. A comprehensive performance measure is developed that accounts for the costs of testing, morbidity, and mortality associated with the tests, and time taken to reach diagnosis. The performance measure also accounts for the diagnostic ability of the tests. The methodology combines tools from the fields of data mining (rough set theory, in particular), utility theory, Markov decision processes (MDP), and reinforcement learning (RL). The rough set theory is used in extracting diagnostic information in the form of rules from the medical databases. Utility theory is used in bringing various nonhomogenous performance measures into one cost based measure. An MDP model together with an RL algorithm facilitates obtaining efficient testing strategies. The methodology is implemented on a sample problem of diagnosing solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN). The results obtained are compared with those from four alternative testing strategies. Our methodology holds significant promise to improve the process of medical diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Determining the most efficient use of diagnostic tests is one of the complex issues facing medical practitioners. With the soaring cost of healthcare, particularly in the US, there is a critical need for cutting costs of diagnostic tests, while achieving a higher level of diagnostic accuracy. This paper develops a learning based methodology that, based on patient information, recommends test(s) that optimize a suitable measure of diagnostic performance. A comprehensive performance measure is developed that accounts for the costs of testing, morbidity, and mortality associated with the tests, and time taken to reach diagnosis. The performance measure also accounts for the diagnostic ability of the tests. The methodology combines tools from the fields of data mining (rough set theory, in particular), utility theory, Markov decision processes (MDP), and reinforcement learning (RL). The rough set theory is used in extracting diagnostic information in the form of rules from the medical databases. Utility theory is used in bringing various nonhomogenous performance measures into one cost based measure. An MDP model together with an RL algorithm facilitates obtaining efficient testing strategies. The methodology is implemented on a sample problem of diagnosing solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN). The results obtained are compared with those from four alternative testing strategies. Our methodology holds significant promise to improve the process of medical diagnosis.},

Such topics can deter students from selecting particular courses or hinder their study progress. This study focused on the subject of medicinal chemistry, which is a discipline combining medicine and chemistry. This combination of applied and basic science creates a complex field of education that is challenging to both teach and learn. Chemical and pharmacological principles are typically presented in 2D molecular structures and, recently, 3D molecular models have been utilized to improve the visualization of chemical compounds and their chemical interactions. Contemporary studies have presented Virtual Reality (VR) as an alternative method for improving the learning and teaching of multidisciplinary specialties such as this. However, current educational efforts employing VR offer limited interactivity and a traditional teaching method previously presented in 2D. This reduces students' interest and concentration in the taught subjects. This paper presents the development rationale of a novel VR educational application based on the evaluation of the user requirements by 405 pharmacy undergraduate students. The results informed the development and preliminary evaluation of a proposed VR serious game application, which was deployed in a real-life class environment and evaluated in contrast to traditional teaching methods by 15 students. The derived results confirmed the advantages of VR technology as a learning and teaching tool, in addition to the end-users' willingness to adopt VR systems as a learning aid.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the electricity industry has become increasingly important to social and economic development. For sustainability of the power industrial business, an accurate electricity consumption forecasting model can be used to adjust the production and consumption patterns of electricity, it can also support energy policy decision-making, such as load unit commitment, operational security of plants, and economic load dispatching. Using electricity consumption data to study electricity production and consumption patterns is useful in identifying the regulation of electricity economic development. This paper combines several machine learning approaches (the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, the support vector regression (SVR) model, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm), thermal reaction dynamics theory, and the econometric model (ARGARCH model), to develop a novel hybrid forecasting model, namely EMD-SVR-PSO-AR-GARCH model, for forecasting electricity consumption. It adopts a new perspective on electricity usage and consuming economic behaviors. Using electricity consumption data from the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) market, the developed model is used to forecast electricity consumption. Then, the Nash equilibrium and Porter's five-force model are used to analyze the complex electricity usage and consuming economic behaviors, to identify the regulation of electricity and economic development, supporting the sustainable development of electricity.},

  abstract = {Automatic facial expression analysis aims to analyse human facial expressions and classify them into discrete categories. Methods based on existing work are reliant on extracting information from video sequences and employ either some form of subjective thresholding of dynamic information or attempt to identify the particular individual frames in which the expected behaviour occurs. These methods are inefficient as they require either additional subjective information, tedious manual work or fail to take advantage of the information contained in the dynamic signature from facial movements for the task of expression recognition. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for automatic facial expression analysis which extracts salient information from video sequences but does not rely on any subjective preprocessing or additional user-supplied information to select frames with peak expressions. The experimental framework demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms static expression recognition systems in terms of recognition rate. The approach does not rely on action units (AUs), and therefore, eliminates errors which are otherwise propagated to the final result due to incorrect initial identification of AUs. The proposed framework explores a parametric space of over 300 dimensions and is tested with six state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Such robust and extensive experimentation provides an important foundation for the assessment of the performance for future work. A further contribution of the paper is offered in the form of a user study. This was conducted in order to investigate the correlation between human cognitive systems and the proposed framework for the understanding of human emotion classification and the reliability of public databases.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical risk prediction models (CRPMs) use patient characteristics to estimate the probability of having or developing a particular disease and/or outcome. While CRPMs are gaining in popularity, they have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice. The lack of explainability and interpretability has limited their utility. Explainability is the extent of which a model's prediction process can be described. Interpretability is the degree to which a user can understand the predictions made by a model., METHODS: The study aimed to demonstrate utility of patient similarity analytics in developing an explainable and interpretable CRPM. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in a Singapore public primary care clinic. We used modified K-nearest neighbour which incorporated expert input, to develop a patient similarity model on this real-world training dataset (n = 7,041) and validated it on a testing dataset (n = 3,018). The results were compared using logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models from the same dataset. The patient similarity model was then implemented in a prototype system to demonstrate the identification, explainability and interpretability of similar patients and the prediction process., RESULTS: The patient similarity model (AUROC = 0.718) was comparable to the logistic regression (AUROC = 0.695), RF (AUROC = 0.764) and SVM models (AUROC = 0.766). We packaged the patient similarity model in a prototype web application. A proof of concept demonstrated how the application provided both quantitative and qualitative information, in the form of patient narratives. This information was used to better inform and influence clinical decision-making, such as getting a patient to agree to start insulin therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Patient similarity analytics is a feasible approach to develop an explainable and interpretable CRPM. While the approach is generalizable, it can be used to develop locally relevant information, based on the database it searches. Ultimately, such an approach can generate a more informative CRPMs which can be deployed as part of clinical decision support tools to better facilitate shared decision-making in clinical practice.},

However, the impact of the injury could be limited/decreased by early management and treatment. TBI can cause subdural hematoma (SDH), diffuse axonal injury, lacerations and other injuries. The focus of our study is on SDH detection as it is one of the most common sequelae of TBI and can be difficult to detect through visual examination. In this study, we propose fully automated image processing and machine learning based approaches for detecting convexity subdural hematomas and measuring the volume of SDH quantitatively. We analyze head Computed Tomography (CT) images and extract textural, statistical and geometrical features of sample points from the intracranial region to train a classifier. We implement a tree bagger classifier to classify each point as hematoma or no-hematoma.We apply our method on 42 CT image sets where 35 sets captured from patients with SDH froma University of Michigan Hospital database. The total number of CT images used in our analysis is 866 and our method could yield sensitivity and specificity values of 85.02\% and 73.74\%. Specificity coefficient in 6 out of 7 of the control cases are over 97.5\%.},

  abstract = {Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common heart arrhythmia that often goes undetected, and even if it is detected, managing the condition may be challenging. In this paper, we review how the RR interval and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, incorporated into a monitoring system, can be useful to track AF events. Were such an automated system to be implemented, it could be used to help manage AF and thereby reduce patient morbidity and mortality. The main impetus behind the idea of developing a service is that a greater data volume analyzed can lead to better patient outcomes. Based on the literature review, which we present herein, we introduce the methods that can be used to detect AF efficiently and automatically via the RR interval and ECG signals. A cardiovascular disease monitoring service that incorporates one or multiple of these detection methods could extend event observation to all times, and could therefore become useful to establish any AF occurrence. The development of an automated and efficient method that monitors AF in real time would likely become a key component for meeting public health goals regarding the reduction of fatalities caused by the disease. Yet, at present, significant technological and regulatory obstacles remain, which prevent the development of any proposed system. Establishment of the scientific foundation for monitoring is important to provide effective service to patients and healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Emergency Departments' (ED) modern triage systems implemented worldwide are solely based upon medical knowledge and experience. This is a limitation of these systems, since there might be hidden patterns that can be explored in big volumes of clinical historical data. Intelligent techniques can be applied to these data to develop clinical decision support systems (CDSS) thereby providing the health professionals with objective criteria. Therefore, it is of foremost importance to identify what has been hampering the application of such systems for ED triage., OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to assess how intelligent CDSS for triage have been contributing to the improvement of quality of care in the ED as well as to identify the challenges they have been facing regarding implementation., METHODS: We applied a standard scoping review method with the manual search of 6 digital libraries, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Springer, MedlinePlus and Web of Knowledge. Search queries were created and customized for each digital library in order to acquire the information. The core search consisted of searching in the papers' title, abstract and key words for the topics "triage", "emergency department"/"emergency room" and concepts within the field of intelligent systems., RESULTS: From the review search, we found that logistic regression was the most frequently used technique for model design and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) the most frequently used performance measure. Beside triage priority, the most frequently used variables for modelling were patients' age, gender, vital signs and chief complaints. The main contributions of the selected papers consisted in the improvement of a patient's prioritization, prediction of need for critical care, hospital or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, ED Length of Stay (LOS) and mortality from information available at the triage., CONCLUSIONS: In the papers where CDSS were validated in the ED, the authors found that there was an improvement in the health professionals' decision-making thereby leading to better clinical management and patients' outcomes. However, we found that more than half of the studies lacked this implementation phase. We concluded that for these studies, it is necessary to validate the CDSS and to define key performance measures in order to demonstrate the extent to which incorporation of CDSS at triage can actually improve care.

  abstract = {Introduction:  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises. Objective: Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media. Methodology: We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common. Conclusions: The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis.}

  abstract = {In health systems, there has been an emergence of new types of data and new technologies that allow continuously monitoring the status of the patients and make easy the achievement of real time information. The storage of all the acquired information makes possible to identify trends in medical data by means of new Clinical Decision Support subsystems. Current knowledge management solutions are specific, proprietary and closed and can not perform real-time analysis to improve the patient's diagnosis or treatment. There are neither solutions that integrate the large amount of heterogeneous information that nowadays are available in health environments. To overcome these objections, this paper proposes a new approach to design a data management system in a telehealthcare system with specific real-time constraints on knowledge acquisition and generation. It is a preliminary study and presents the main features of the system architecture and a preview of the technological solution implemented.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been recently introduced to develop prognostic classification models that can be used to predict outcomes in individual cancer patients. Here, we report the significance of an ML-based decision support system (DSS), combined with random optimization (RO), to extract prognostic information from routinely collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data of breast cancer (BC) patients. A DSS model was developed in a training set (n = 318), whose performance analysis in the testing set (n = 136) resulted in a C-index for progression-free survival of 0.84, with an accuracy of 86\%. Furthermore, the model was capable of stratifying the testing set into two groups of patients with low- or high-risk of progression with a hazard ratio (HR) of 10.9 (p {$<$} 0.0001). Validation in multicenter prospective studies and appropriate management of privacy issues in relation to digital electronic health records (EHR) data are presently needed. Nonetheless, we may conclude that the implementation of ML algorithms and RO models into EHR data might help to achieve prognostic information, and has the potential to revolutionize the practice of personalized medicine.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. As early detection is crucial for the patient's health, much attention has been paid to the development of tools for effective recognition of this disease. This article presents an application of image analysis and classification methods for fine needle biopsy. In our approach, each patient is described by nine microscopic images taken from the biopsy sample. The images are related to regions of the biopsy that seem interesting to the physician who selects them arbitrarily. We propose four different hybrid segmentation algorithms dedicated to processing these images and examine their effectiveness for the nuclei feature extraction task. Classification is carried out with the usage of a classifier ensemble based on the Random Subspaces approach. To boost its effectiveness, we use a linear combination of the support functions returned by the individual classifiers in the ensemble. In the proposed medical support system, the final decision about the patient is delivered after a fusion of nine separate outputs of the classifier - each for a different image. Experimental results carried out on a diverse dataset collected by the authors prove that the proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers and shows itself to be a valuable tool for supporting day-to-day cytologist's routine.

  abstract = {Simple Summary Colorectal cancer is the second most malignant tumor per number of deaths after lung cancer and the third per number of new cases after breast and lung cancer. The correct and rapid identification (i.e., segmentation of the cancer regions) is a fundamental task for correct patient diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel automated pipeline for the segmentation of MRI scans of patients with LARC in order to predict the response to nCRT using radiomic features. This study involved the retrospective analysis of T-2-weighted MRI scans of 43 patients affected by LARC. The segmentation of tumor areas was on par or better than the state-of-the-art results, but required smaller sample sizes. The analysis of radiomic features allowed us to predict the TRG score, which agreed with the state-of-the-art results. Background: Rectal cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the large intestine resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of the rectal tract. Predicting the pathologic response of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy at an MRI primary staging scan in patients affected by locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) could lead to significant improvement in the survival and quality of life of the patients. In this study, the possibility of automatizing this estimation from a primary staging MRI scan, using a fully automated artificial intelligence-based model for the segmentation and consequent characterization of the tumor areas using radiomic features was evaluated. The TRG score was used to evaluate the clinical outcome. Methods: Forty-three patients under treatment in the IRCCS Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Polyclinic were retrospectively selected for the study; a U-Net model was trained for the automated segmentation of the tumor areas; the radiomic features were collected and used to predict the tumor regression grade (TRG) score. Results: The segmentation of tumor areas outperformed the state-of-the-art results in terms of the Dice score coefficient or was comparable to them but with the advantage of considering mucinous cases. Analysis of the radiomic features extracted from the lesion areas allowed us to predict the TRG score, with the results agreeing with the state-of-the-art results. Conclusions: The results obtained regarding TRG prediction using the proposed fully automated pipeline prove its possible usage as a viable decision support system for radiologists in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Patient telemonitoring results in an aggregation of significant amounts of information about patient disease trajectory. However, the potential use of this information for early prediction of exacerbations in adult asthma patients has not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of telemonitoring data for building machine learning algorithms that predict asthma exacerbations before they occur. The study dataset comprised daily self-monitoring reports consisting of 7001 records submitted by adult asthma patients during home telemonitoring. Predictive modeling included preparation of stratified training datasets, predictive feature selection, and evaluation of resulting classifiers. Using a 7-day window, a naive Bayesian classifier, adaptive Bayesian network, and support vector machines were able to predict asthma exacerbation occurring on day 8, with sensitivity of 0.80, 1.00, and 0.84; specificity of 0.77, 1.00, and 0.80; and accuracy of 0.77, 1.00, and 0.80, respectively. Our study demonstrated that machine learning techniques have significant potential in developing personalized decision support for chronic disease telemonitoring systems. Future studies may benefit from a comprehensive predictive framework that combines telemonitoring data with other factors affecting the likelihood of developing acute exacerbation. Approaches implemented for advanced asthma exacerbation prediction may be extended to prediction of exacerbations in patients with other chronic health conditions.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wide-scale adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) has created an unprecedented opportunity for the implementation of Rapid Learning Systems (RLSs) that leverage primary clinical data for real-time decision support. In cancer, where large variations among patient features leave gaps in traditional forms of medical evidence, the potential impact of a RLS is particularly promising. We developed the Melanoma Rapid Learning Utility (MRLU), a component of the RLS, providing an analytical engine and user interface that enables physicians to gain clinical insights by rapidly identifying and analyzing cohorts of patients similar to their own., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new approach for clinical decision support in Melanoma was developed and implemented, in which patient-centered cohorts are generated from practice-based evidence and used to power on-the-fly stratified survival analyses. A database to underlie the system was generated from clinical, pharmaceutical, and molecular data from 237 patients with metastatic melanoma from two academic medical centers. The system was assessed in two ways: (1) ability to rediscover known knowledge and (2) potential clinical utility and usability through a user study of 13 practicing oncologists., RESULTS: The MRLU enables physician-driven cohort selection and stratified survival analysis. The system successfully identified several known clinical trends in melanoma, including frequency of BRAF mutations, survival rate of patients with BRAF mutant tumors in response to BRAF inhibitor therapy, and sex-based trends in prevalence and survival. Surveyed physician users expressed great interest in using such on-the-fly evidence systems in practice (mean response from relevant survey questions 4.54/5.0), and generally found the MRLU in particular to be both useful (mean score 4.2/5.0) and useable (4.42/5.0)., DISCUSSION: The MRLU is an RLS analytical engine and user interface for Melanoma treatment planning that presents design principles useful in building RLSs. Further research is necessary to evaluate when and how to best use this functionality within the EMR clinical workflow for guiding clinical decision making., CONCLUSION: The MRLU is an important component in building a RLS for data driven precision medicine in Melanoma treatment that could be generalized to other clinical disorders.

Artificial intelligence in interventional radiation therapy: AI in RO has a large impact in providing clinical decision support, data mining and advanced imaging analysis, automating repetitive tasks, optimizing time, and modelling patients and physicians' behaviors in heterogeneous contexts. Implementing AI and automation in RO and IRT can successfully facilitate all the steps of treatment workflow, such as patient consultation, target volume delineation, treatment planning, and treatment delivery.

  abstract = {We report on a global survey of diagnosing mental health professionals, primarily psychiatrists, conducted as a part of the development of the ICD-11 mental and behavioural disorders classification. The survey assessed these professionals' use of various components of the ICD-10 and the DSM, their attitudes concerning the utility of these systems, and usage of “residual” (i.e., “other” or “unspecified”) categories. In previous surveys, most mental health professionals reported they often use a formal classification system in everyday clinical work, but very little is known about precisely how they are using those systems. For example, it has been suggested that most clinicians employ only the diagnostic labels or codes from the ICD-10 in order to meet administrative requirements. The present survey was conducted with clinicians who were members of the Global Clinical Practice Network (GCPN), established by the World Health Organization as a tool for global participation in ICD-11 field studies. A total of 1,764 GCPN members from 92 countries completed the survey, with 1,335 answering the questions with reference to the ICD-10 and 429 to the DSM (DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5). The most frequent reported use of the classification systems was for administrative or billing purposes, with 68.1\% reporting often or routinely using them for that purpose. A bit more than half (57.4\%) of respondents reported often or routinely going through diagnostic guidelines or criteria systematically to determine whether they apply to individual patients. Although ICD-10 users were more likely than DSM-5 users to utilize the classification for administrative purposes, other differences were either slight or not significant. Both classifications were rated to be most useful for assigning a diagnosis, communicating with other health care professionals and teaching, and least useful for treatment selection and determining prognosis. ICD-10 was rated more useful than DSM-5 for administrative purposes. A majority of clinicians reported using “residual” categories at least sometimes, with around 12\% of ICD-10 users and 19\% of DSM users employing them often or routinely, most commonly for clinical presentations that do not conform to a specific diagnostic category or when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. These results provide the most comprehensive available information about the use of diagnostic classifications of mental disorders in ordinary clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Hospitals play an important role towards ensuring proper health treatment to human beings. One of the major challenges faced in this context refers to the increasingly overcrowded patients queues, which contribute to a potential deterioration of patients health conditions. One of the reasons of such an inefficiency is a poor allocation of health professionals. In particular, such allocation process is usually unable to properly adapt to unexpected changes in the patients demand. As a consequence, it is frequently the case where underused rooms have idle professionals whilst overused rooms have less professionals than necessary. Previous works addressed this issue by analyzing the evolution of supply (doctors) and demand (patients) so as to better adjust one to the other, though none of them focused on proposing effective counter-measures to mitigate poor allocations. In this paper, we build upon the concept of smart hospitals and introduce elastic allocation of human resources in healthcare environments (ElHealth), an IoT-focused model able to monitor patients usage of hospital rooms and to adapt the allocation of health professionals to these rooms so as to meet patients needs. ElHealth employs data prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand of a given room will exceeds its capacity, and to propose actions to allocate health professionals accordingly. We also introduce the concept of multi-level predictive elasticity of human resources (which is an extension of the concept of resource elasticity, from cloud computing) to manage the use of human resources at different levels of a healthcare environment. Furthermore, we devise the concept of proactive human resources elastic speedup (which is an extension of the speedup concept, from parallel computing) to properly measure the gain of healthcare time with dynamic parallel use of human resources within hospital environments. ElHealth was thoroughly evaluated based on simulations of a hospital environment using data from a Brazilian polyclinic, and obtained promising results, decreasing the waiting time by up to 96.71\%.},

  abstract = {Background: Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective: This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods: Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results: From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions: We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.},

Our meta-analysis of the reaction performance generates data-driven cheatsheets for reaction condition recommendation. It also provides an interactive tool to find rarer ligands with optimal performance regarding user-selected substrate properties. With this we give practitioners promising starting points. Furthermore, we study bias and diversity in the literature and summarize the current state of the reaction data, including its pitfalls.

The wealth of information provided by each social media user in combination with machine-learning technologies may pave the way for automated psychological assessment and diagnosis. Assessment of individuals' social media profiles using machine-learning technologies for diagnosis and screening confers many benefits (i.e., time and cost efficiency, reduced recall bias, information about an individual's emotions and functioning spanning months or years, etc.); however, the implementation of these technologies will pose unique challenges to the professional ethics of psychology. Namely, psychologists must understand the impact of these assessment technologies on privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, recordkeeping, bases for assessments, and diversity and justice. This paper offers a brief review of the current applications of machine-learning technologies in psychology and public health, provides an overview of potential implementations in clinical settings, and introduces ethical considerations for professional psychologists.

Deep-Learning using Artificial Neural Networks is one of the popular methods for extracting information from complex datasets. Deep-learning is capable of more creating complex models than traditional probabilistic machine learning techniques. This work presents a step-by-step guide on how to prototype a Deep-Learning application that executes both on GPU and CPU clusters. Python and Redis are the core supporting tools of this guide. This tutorial will allow the reader to understand the basics of building a distributed high performance GPU application in a few hours.

Recent advancements have demonstrated the capabilities of transient absorption microscopy (TAM) for label-free quantification of hemoglobin and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for pathological assessment of label-free virtual histochemical staining. We propose the combination of TAM and SRS with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) to characterize, quantify, and compare hemodynamics, vessel structure, cell density, and cell identity in vivo between age groups. In this study, we construct a simultaneous nonlinear absorption, Raman, and fluorescence (SNARF) microscope with the highest reported in vivo imaging depth for SRS and TAM at 250-280 mu m to enable these multimodal measurements. Using machine learning, we predict capillary-lining cell identities with 90\% accuracy based on nuclear morphology and capillary relationship. The microscope and methodology outlined herein provides an exciting route to study several research topics, including neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study a microscope is constructed that carries out simultaneous nonlinear absorption, Raman, and fluorescence (SNARF). Machine learning is then used to predict capillary-lining cell identities with 90\% accuracy based on nuclear morphology and capillary relationship, which in combination with the developed microscope, can provide a means to study several fields such as neurovascular coupling.},

Here, we consider how it will change daily practice for cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and healthcare professionals. Clinical evidence for any high-risk device must be reported by the manufacturer in a Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) that will be publicly available in the European Union Database on Medical Devices (Eudamed) maintained by the European Commission; this will facilitate evidence-based choices of which devices to recommend. Hospitals must record all device implantations, and each high-risk device will be trackable by Unique Device Identification (UDI). Important new roles are envisaged for clinicians, scientists, and engineers in EU Expert Panels-in particular to scrutinize clinical data submitted by manufacturers for certain high-risk devices and the evaluations of that data made by notified bodies. They will advise manufacturers on the design of their clinical studies and recommend to regulators when new technical specifications or guidance are needed. Physicians should support post-market surveillance by reporting adverse events and by contributing to comprehensive medical device registries. A second law on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices will take effect from 2022. We encourage all healthcare professionals to contribute proactively to these new systems, in order to enhance the efficacy and safety of high-risk devices and to promote equitable access to effective innovations.

Unlike the perception of healthcare professionals, the attitudes of patients and their companions have been of less interest so far. In this study, we aimed to investigate the perception of artificial intelligence in healthcare among this highly relevant group along with the influence of digital affinity and sociodemographic factors. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a paper-based questionnaire with patients and their companions at a German tertiary referral hospital from December 2019 to February 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections examining (a) the respondents' technical affinity, (b) their perception of different aspects of artificial intelligence in healthcare and (c) sociodemographic characteristics. Results From a total of 452 participants, more than 90\% already read or heard about artificial intelligence, but only 24\% reported good or expert knowledge. Asked on their general perception, 53.18\% of the respondents rated the use of artificial intelligence in medicine as positive or very positive, but only 4.77\% negative or very negative. The respondents denied concerns about artificial intelligence, but strongly agreed that artificial intelligence must be controlled by a physician. Older patients, women, persons with lower education and technical affinity were more cautious on the healthcare-related artificial intelligence usage. Conclusions German patients and their companions are open towards the usage of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Although showing only a mediocre knowledge about artificial intelligence, a majority rated artificial intelligence in healthcare as positive. Particularly, patients insist that a physician supervises the artificial intelligence and keeps ultimate responsibility for diagnosis and therapy.},

  abstract = {Traditional educational giants and natural language processing companies have launched several artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital learning applications to facilitate language learning. One typical application of AI in digital language education is the automatic scoring application that provides feedback on pronunciation repeat outcomes. This research is motivated by the usage of automatic scoring-empowered digital learning tools by language learners, and set out to uncover the influencing mechanisms of AI-enabled automatic scoring application affordances on learners' continuous learning intention. Specifically, based on affordance theory, we found several automatic scoring application affordances through in-depth interviews. Considering the current lack of investigations on the mechanisms underlying automatic scoring application and its implications for learners' learning behaviors, we built a model to examine the role of automatic scoring application affordances on cognitive/emotional engagement and following continuous learning intention. We further examined the moderation role of in-job learners and student learners on the above relationships. The model was tested using a survey of 260 Chinese foreign language learners who used AI-empowered learning tools to facilitate their language learning practices. This study explores why learners continuously use AI-enabled automatic scoring applications by identifying the affordances that differentiate it from traditional educational technologies. Practitioners could take the identified affordances into account when designing AI-enabled language learning applications.},

It may not appear to be very much related to the system, but it is very relevant in achieving its successful adoption. However, requirements engineers have usually a background in Software Engineering and are not trained to elicit this kind of information. This situation raises the need for analytical tools to deal with these features. These tools should enable collaborative work between requirements engineers, who use them in development, social practitioners, who provide the knowledge and processes underlying these tools, and the customers, who know the domain and intended application of the projects. The framework presented in this paper is based on the socio-psychological Activity Theory and its analysis of human contexts. It includes a repository of social properties and a process to perform this elicitation using it. The paper illustrates its application through a case study on the impact of a new system in the organization of a firm.},

However, little is known about the usefulness of machine learning approaches in the decision-making process for decisions such as insulin initiation by diabetes specialists for which no absolute standards exist in clinical settings. Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine the ability of machine learning models to predict insulin initiation by specialists and whether the machine learning approach could support decision making by general physicians for insulin initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Data from patients prescribed hypoglycemic agents from December 2009 to March 2015 were extracted from diabetes specialists' registries, resulting in a sample size of 4860 patients who had received initial monotherapy with either insulin (n=293) or noninsulin (n=4567). Neural network output was insulin initiation ranging from 0 to 1 with a cutoff of {$>$}0.5 for the dichotomous classification. Accuracy, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to compare the ability of machine learning models to make decisions regarding insulin initiation to the decision-making ability of logistic regression and general physicians. By comparing the decision-making ability of machine learning and logistic regression to that of general physicians, 7 cases were chosen based on patient information as the gold standard based on the agreement of 8 of the 9 specialists. Results: The AUCs, accuracy, and recall of logistic regression were higher than those of machine learning (AUCs of 0.89-0.90 for logistic regression versus 0.67-0.74 for machine learning). When the examination was limited to cases receiving insulin, discrimination by machine learning was similar to that of logistic regression analysis (recall of 0.05-0.68 for logistic regression versus 0.11-0.52 for machine learning). Accuracies of logistic regression, a machine learning model (downsampling ratio of 1:8), and general physicians were 0.80, 0.70, and 0.66, respectively, for 43 randomly selected cases. For the 7 gold standard cases, the accuracies of logistic regression and the machine learning model were 1.00 and 0.86, respectively, with a downsampling ratio of 1:8, which were higher than the accuracy of general physicians (ie, 0.43). Conclusions: Although we found no superior performance of machine learning over logistic regression, machine learning had higher accuracy in prediction of insulin initiation than general physicians, defined by diabetes specialists' choice of the gold standard. Further study is needed before the use of machine learning-based decision support systems for insulin initiation can be incorporated into clinical practice.},

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the acceptance, barriers, and facilitators to implementing AI-based CDSSs in the emergency care setting through the opinions of physicians on our newly developed, real-time AI-based CDSS, which alerts ED physicians by predicting aortic dissection based on numeric and text information from medical charts, by using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT; for quantitative evaluation) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; for qualitative evaluation) frameworks. Methods: This mixed methods study was performed from March to April 2021. Transitional year residents (n=6), emergency medicine residents (n=5), and emergency physicians (n=3) from two community, tertiary care hospitals in Japan were included. We first developed a real-time CDSS for predicting aortic dissection based on numeric and text information from medical charts (eg, chief complaints, medical history, vital signs) with natural language processing. This system was deployed on the internet, and the participants used the system with clinical vignettes of model cases. Participants were then involved in a mixed methods evaluation consisting of a UTAUT-based questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale (quantitative) and a CFIR-based semistructured interview (qualitative). Cronbach a was calculated as a reliability estimate for UTAUT subconstructs. Interviews were sampled, transcribed, and analyzed using the MaxQDA software. The framework analysis approach was used during the study to determine the relevance of the CFIR constructs. Results: All 14 participants completed the questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative analysis revealed generally positive responses for user acceptance with all scores above the neutral score of 3.0. In addition, the mixed methods analysis identified two significant barriers (System Performance, Compatibility) and two major facilitators (Evidence Strength, Design Quality) for implementation of AI-based CDSSs in emergency care settings. Conclusions: Our mixed methods evaluation based on theoretically grounded frameworks revealed the acceptance, barriers, and facilitators of implementation of AI-based CDSS. Although the concern of system failure and overtrusting of the system could be barriers to implementation, the locality of the system and designing an intuitive user interface could likely facilitate the use of optimal AI-based CDSS. Alleviating and resolving these factors should be key to achieving good user acceptance of AI-based CDSS.},

  abstract = {The usefulness of current psychiatric classification, which is based on ICD/DSM categorical diagnoses, remains questionable. A promising alternative has been put forward as the “transdiagnostic” approach. This is expected to cut across existing categorical diagnoses and go beyond them, to improve the way we classify and treat mental disorders. This systematic review explores whether self-defining transdiagnostic research meets such high expectations. A multi-step Web of Science literature search was performed according to an a priori protocol, to identify all studies that used the word “transdiagnostic” in their title, up to May 5, 2018. Empirical variables which indexed core characteristics were extracted, complemented by a bibliometric and conceptual analysis. A total of 111 studies were included. Most studies were investigating interventions, followed by cognition and psychological processes, and neuroscientific topics. Their samples ranged from 15 to 91,199 (median 148) participants, with a mean age from 10 to more than 60 (median 33) years. There were several methodological inconsistencies relating to the definition of the gold standard (DSM/ICD diagnoses), of the outcome measures and of the transdiagnostic approach. The quality of the studies was generally low and only a few findings were externally replicated. The majority of studies tested transdiagnostic features cutting across different diagnoses, and only a few tested new classification systems beyond the existing diagnoses. About one fifth of the studies were not transdiagnostic at all, because they investigated symptoms and not disorders, a single disorder, or because there was no diagnostic information. The bibliometric analysis revealed that transdiagnostic research largely restricted its focus to anxiety and depressive disorders. The conceptual analysis showed that transdiagnostic research is grounded more on rediscoveries than on true innovations, and that it is affected by some conceptual biases. To date, transdiagnostic approaches have not delivered a credible paradigm shift that can impact classification and clinical care. Practical “TRANSD”iagnostic recommendations are proposed here to guide future research in this field.},

This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students’ attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula. In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of AI can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts.},

We propose the application of a hybrid modeling approach for decision support models consisting of expert-based implementation of a decision model structure and machine-learning (ML) based parameter generation. We demonstrate our approach for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer., METHODS: We created a clinical decision model based on Bayesian Networks and iteratively optimized its characteristics using structured knowledge engineering approaches. We combined manual adaptation of individual concepts with automatic learning of parameters and causalities. Using data from 94 patient records, we targeted the needed objectivity and clinical significance., RESULTS: In three iteration steps, we assessed the model with cross-validations. The initial aggregated accuracy of 0.529 could be increased to 0.883 in the final version. The predictive rates of the target nodes range from 0.557 to 0.960., CONCLUSION: Combining different methodological approaches requires balancing the complexity of the clinical subject matter with the amount of information available in the dataset for ML application. Our method showed promising results because flaws of one approach can be overcome by the other approach. However, technical integrability as well as clinical acceptance must always be ensured.

  abstract = {Background: The enactment of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) in 2015 initiated the transition from a fee-for service to a fee-for-value payment system in healthcare. Two government-sponsored VBC models (Oncology Care Model [OCM] and MeritBased Incentive Payment System [MIPS]) were introduced in 2016 and 2017. Several commercial payers followed suit with similar value-based contracts. Implementing and complying with the performance metrics of these models comes with challenges. This qualitative research study sought to assess participation in both government-sponsored and commercial-insurance-sponsored VBC models among oncology providers and their perceptions regarding the ability to perform successfully. Method(s): Between February and April 2021, medical oncologists/hematologists (mO/H) from across the U.S. were invited to complete a web-based survey about various trends and critical issues in oncology care. Demographics about the physicians and characteristics of their practices were captured as well in the survey. Responses were aggregated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Result(s): A total of 307 mO/H across the U.S. completed the survey: 73\% practice in a community setting; 47\% identify as hospital employees. The participants spend a median of 90\% of their working time in direct patient care, have a median of 16 years of clinical experience, and see a median of 20 patients per day on clinic days. Half participate in a governmentsponsored VBC model (21\% MIPS and 28\% OCM), and 20\% participate in a commercial VBC model. A third reported that it is difficult to perform favorably in VBC models (37\% government and 35\% commercial). Primary challenges deterring favorable performance were navigating the payer landscape and reimbursements (27\%), identifying costreduction opportunities (20\%), tracking costs across an episode (18\%), and clinical decision support and compliance (17\%). One-third are not satisfied with currently available technology to effectively support their performance in VBC models. Almost half would like to see more seamless integration into practice workflows (49\%) and interoperability across platforms including EHRs (42\%), and 24\% would like artificial intelligence or machine learning features integrated into solutions tools. Conclusion(s): Oncology practices find it challenging to perform favorably in government and private payer-sponsored VBC models. They are generally dissatisfied with current technology and see an unmet need for interoperability and artificial intelligence to better support their performance in these programs. Further research is needed to determine how best to design and implement VBC programs.},

Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective: This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results: In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science.},

  abstract = {BackgroundFace masks have been employed in the COVID-19 pandemic plans as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In Poland, obligatory wearing of masks in public spaces was introduced on April 10th, 2020; a relaxation of previous universal measures was announced on May 29th, 2020, limiting use to indoor public places.ObjectiveTo assess use of masks or other protective devices in public spaces in Poland during the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic.MethodsA non-participatory covert observational study was conducted on three dates, (10.05/18.05/25.05.2020) at public spaces in 13 regions with different risks. Ten consecutive individuals were observed by each of 82 medical students (n=2460 observations), using a structured checklist.ResultsAmong 2353 observed persons, the female/male ratios were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 on the three dates. Almost three quarters - 73.6\% (n=552/750) were using masks on date 1, 66.5\% (544/818) on date 2; and 65.7\% (516/785) on date 3. Cloth masks predominated on all dates (64.7-62.3\%-62.6\%), followed by medical (23.4-28.5\%-26.9\%). Being female (OR=1.77-1.47-1.53 respectively) and location in a closed space (OR=2.60-2.59-2.32) were each associated with higher usage. Participants in sports were about two times less likely to use masks (OR=0.64-0.53-0.53) as compared to other activities. The proportion using masks correctly decreased gradually over time (364/552; 65.9\%; 339/544; 62.3\% and 304/516; 58.9\%). More females wore masks correctly (date 1: 205/294; 69.7\% vs 159/258; 61.6\%, and date 3: 186/284; 65.5\% vs 118/232; 50.9\%; p=0.045; p=0.0008 respectively). Uncovered noses (47.3-52.7\%) and masks around the neck (39.2-42.6\%) were the most frequent incorrect practices.ConclusionsPractices were not in line with official recommendations, especially among males, and deteriorated over time. Cloth masks were predominantly used in public spaces. Health promotion, through utilizing all available communication channels, would be helpful to increase compliance.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning models are wellpositioned to transform cancer care delivery by providing oncologists with more accurate or accessible information to augment clinical decisions. Many machine learning projects, however, focus on model accuracy without considering the impact of using the model in real-world settings and rarely carry forward to clinical implementation. We present a humancentered systems engineering approach to address clinical problems with workflow interventions utilizing machine learning algorithms. Method(s): We aimed to develop a mortality predictive tool, using a Random Forest algorithm, to identify oncology patients at high risk of death within 30 days to move advance care planning (ACP) discussions earlier in the illness trajectory. First, a project sponsor defined the clinical need and requirements of an intervention. The data scientists developed the predictive algorithm using data available in the electronic health record (EHR). A multidisciplinary workgroup was assembled including oncology physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, social workers, chaplain, clinical informaticists, and data scientists. Meeting bi-monthly, the group utilized human-centered design (HCD) methods to understand clinical workflows and identify points of intervention. The workgroup completed a workflow redesign workshop, a 90-minute facilitated group discussion, to integrate the model in a future state workflow. An EHR (Epic) analyst built the user interface to support the intervention per the group's requirements. The workflow was piloted in thoracic oncology and bone marrow transplant with plans to scale to other cancer clinics. Result(s): Our predictive model performance on test data was acceptable (sensitivity 75\%, specificity 75\%, F-1 score 0.71, AUC 0.82). The workgroup identified a "quality of life coordinator" who: Reviews an EHR report of patients scheduled in the upcoming 7 days who have a high risk of 30-day mortality; works with the oncology team to determine ACP clinical appropriateness; documents the need for ACP; identifies potential referrals to supportive oncology, social work, or chaplain; and coordinates the oncology appointment. The oncologist receives a reminder on the day of the patient's scheduled visit. Conclusion(s): This workgroup is a viable approach that can be replicated at institutions to address clinical needs and realize the full potential of machine learning models in healthcare. The next steps for this project are to address end-user feedback from the pilot, expand the intervention to other cancer disease groups, and track clinical metrics.},

Currently, there are no clinically useful diagnostic biomarkers that are able to confirm a diagnosis of MDD from bipolar disorder (BD) in the early depressive episode. Therefore, exploring translational biomarkers of mood disorders based on machine learning is in pressing need, though it is challenging, but with great potential to improve our understanding of these disorders. Discussions In this study, we review popular machine-learning methods used for brain imaging classification and predictions, and provide an overview of studies, specifically for MDD, that have used magnetic resonance imaging data to either (a) classify MDDs from controls or other mood disorders or (b) investigate treatment outcome predictors for individual patients. Finally, challenges, future directions, and potential limitations related to MDD biomarker identification are also discussed, with a goal of offering a comprehensive overview that may help readers to better understand the applications of neuroimaging data mining in depression. Conclusions We hope such efforts may highlight the need for an urgently needed paradigm shift in treatment, to guide personalized optimal clinical care.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a new experimental approach to extract pendulum model parameters from spacecraft propellant tank slosh data. The novelty of the approach is in the utilization of steady-state triaxial force measurements at the support points of the tank under sinusoidal excitation. This approach enables repeatable and accurate determination of pendulum model parameters in contrast to the single-axis force sensing and multiple repetitions averaging techniques associated with the more common decay approach. This approach may be used for tanks with free slosh; however, this study considers a diaphragm tank with three different diaphragm configurations under translational oscillatory lateral excitation. With the aid of a parameter optimization technique prevalently used in machine learning, the proposed methodology identifies the pendulum model parameters based on an adaptive gradient descent on the error surface defined in the parameter space. The proposed approach is validated by comparing experimental measurements against model-predicted behavior, and the numerical procedure is verified against a quasi-Newton method. Moreover, the extracted pendulum model parameters enable prediction of the frequency response functions for both the apparent mass and apparent mass moment as function of excitation frequency, and the methodology enables extraction of higher-order vibration modes.},

The mobile devices are an important tool that can install various applications for using information such as clinical guidelines, drug resources, clinical calculations, and the latest scientific evidence without any time and place limitations. And this happens only when students accept and use it. Objective The purpose of this article is to identify the factors influencing students in their intention to use mobile health (mHealth) by using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Methods A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from nearly 302 Lorestan University of medical science students including nutrition and public health, paramedicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, dentistry, and medical schools. The data were processed using LISREL (Scientific Software International, Inc., Lincolnwood, Illinois) and SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) softwares and the statistical analysis technique was based on structural equation modeling (SEM). Result A total of 300 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study. The results showed that mediator of age did not affect the predictors of intention to use mHealth, and the level of education and gender directly affected the intention to use. In addition, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, and behavioral intention directly and indirectly have effect on use, whereas the result revealed no significant relationship between two important processes of performance expectancy and social influence with students’ behavioral intention to use the mHealth. Conclusions The present study provides valuable information on mobile health acceptance factors for widespread use of this device among students of universities of medical sciences as a base infrastructure for a variety of information about health services and learning. Review and comparison of results with other studies showed that mHealth acceptance factors were different from other end users (elderly, patients, and health professionals).},

The different features of smart objects in processing capabilities, memory, and size make it difficult for final users to learn the installation and usage of all these devices in collaboration with other IoT objects, hindering the user experience. In this context, we propose a collaboration mechanism for IoT devices based on the multi-agent systems with mobile agents. This paper illustrates the current approach with smart cupboards for potentially tracking memory losses. The user study revealed that users found working products of this approach usable, easy-to-learn and useful, and they agreed that the current approach could provide a high quality of experience not only in the specific case of service-centric IoT devices for tracking memory losses but also in other domains. The learning capability by means of this approach was showed with significant reductions of reaction times and number of errors over the first and second tests with the current approach. System response times were appropriate for both continuous rendering and presenting the classification results. The usage of RAM memory was also adequate for the common actual devices.},

Compounding these problems, there is an ever increasing number of aging "Baby Boomers" who are becoming patients coupled with a declining number of cardiac diagnosticians experienced in interpreting these studies. Hence, it is crucial that decision support tools be developed and implemented to assist physicians in interpreting studies at a faster rate and at the highest level of up-to-date expertise. Such tools will minimize subjectivity and intra- and inter-observer variation in image interpretation, help achieve a standardized high level of performance, and reduce healthcare costs.

Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation has a critical function(1). However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive immune response in Alzheimer's disease(2). Here, using integrated analyses of multiple cohorts, we identify peripheral and central adaptive immune changes in Alzheimer's disease. First, we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and discovered an immune signature of Alzheimer's disease that consists of increased numbers of CD8(+) T effector memory CD45RA(+) (T-EMRA) cells. In a second cohort, we found that CD8(+) T-EMRA cells were negatively associated with cognition. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T cell receptor (TCR) signalling was enhanced in these cells. Notably, by using several strategies of single-cell TCR sequencing in a third cohort, we discovered clonally expanded CD8(+) T-EMRA cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we used machine learning, cloning and peptide screens to demonstrate the specificity of clonally expanded TCRs in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease to two separate Epstein-Barr virus antigens. These results reveal an adaptive immune response in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease and provide evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration.},

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified functional connectivity patterns associated with acute undernutrition in anorexia nervosa (AN), but few have investigated recovered patients. Thus, a trait connectivity profile characteristic of the disorder remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art graph-theoretic methods in acute AN, the authors previously found abnormal global brain network architecture, possibly driven by local network alterations. To disentangle trait from starvation effects, the present study examines network organization in recovered patients. Methods. Graph-theoretic metrics were used to assess resting-state network properties in a large sample of female patients recovered from AN (recAN, n = 55) compared with pairwise age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 55). Results. Indicative of an altered global network structure, recAN showed increased assortativity and reduced global clustering as well as small-worldness compared with HC, while no group differences at an intermediate or local network level were evident. However, using support-vector classifier on local metrics, recAN and HC could be separated with an accuracy of 70.4\%. Conclusions. This pattern of results suggests that long-term recovered patients have an aberrant global brain network configuration, similar to acutely underweight patients. While the finding of increased assortativity may represent a trait marker of AN, the remaining findings could be seen as a scar following prolonged undernutrition.},

However, the emergence of AI/ML in medicine also creates challenges, which regulators must pay attention to. Which medical AI/ML-based products should be reviewed by regulators? What evidence should be required to permit marketing for AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD)? How can we ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based SaMD that may change over time as they are applied to new data? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, has recently proposed a discussion paper to address some of these issues. But it misses an important point: we argue that regulators like the FDA need to widen their scope from evaluating medical AI/ML-based products to assessing systems. This shift in perspective—from a product view to a system view—is central to maximizing the safety and efficacy of AI/ML in health care, but it also poses significant challenges for agencies like the FDA who are used to regulating products, not systems. We offer several suggestions for regulators to make this challenging but important transition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insomnia affects almost one in four military service members and veterans. The first-line recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). CBTI is typically delivered in-person or online over one-to-four sessions (brief versions) or five-to-eight sessions (standard versions) by a licensed doctoral or masters-level clinician with extensive training in behavioral sleep medicine. Despite its effectiveness, CBTI has limited scalability. Three main factors inhibit access to and delivery of CBTI including restricted availability of clinical expertise; rigid, resource-intensive treatment formats; and limited capacities for just-in-time monitoring and treatment personalization. Digital technologies offer a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges by providing scalable, personalized, resource-sensitive, adaptive, and cost-effective approaches for evidence-based insomnia treatment., METHODS: This is a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness randomized trial using a scalable evidence-based digital health software platform, NOCTEM TM's Clinician-Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST TM). COAST includes a clinician portal and a patient app, and it utilizes algorithms that facilitate detection of sleep disordered patterns, support clinical decision-making, and personalize sleep interventions. The first aim is to compare three clinician- and system-centered implementation strategies on the reach, adoption, and sustainability of the COAST digital platform by offering (1) COAST only, (2) COAST plus external facilitation (EF: assistance and consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts), or (3) COAST plus EF and internal facilitation (EF/IF: assistance/consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts and local champions). The second aim is to quantify improvements in insomnia among patients who receive behavioral sleep care via the COAST platform. We hypothesize that reach, adoption, and sustainability and the magnitude of improvements in insomnia will be superior in the EF and EF/IF groups relative to the COAST-only group., DISCUSSION: Digital health technologies and machine learning-assisted clinical decision support tools have substantial potential for scaling access to insomnia treatment. This can augment the scalability and cost-effectiveness of CBTI without compromising patient outcomes. Engaging providers, stakeholders, patients, and decision-makers is key in identifying strategies to support the deployment of digital health technologies that can promote quality care and result in clinically meaningful sleep improvements, positive systemic change, and enhanced readiness and health among service members., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04366284 .

The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26\% and specificity of 98\%, with a positive predictive value of 29\% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer., CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning algorithm can predict, with low sensitivity but high specificity, the impending occurrence of severe sepsis and septic shock. Algorithm-generated predictive alerts modestly impacted clinical measures. Next steps include describing clinical perception of this tool and optimizing algorithm design and delivery.},

  abstract = {Driven by the global increase in the size and median age of the world population, sight loss is becoming a major public health challenge. Furthermore, the increased survival of premature neonates in low- and middle-income countries is causing an increase in developmental paediatric ophthalmic disease. Finally, there is an ongoing change in health-seeking behaviour worldwide, with consequent demand for increased access to healthcare, including ophthalmology. There is therefore the need to maximise the reach of resource-limited ophthalmology expertise in the context of increasing demand. Yet, ophthalmic diagnostics critically relies on visualisation, through optical imaging, of the front and of the back of the eye, and teleophthalmology, the remote visualisation of diagnostic images, shows promise to offer a viable solution. In this chapter, we first explore the strategies at the core of teleophthalmology and, in particular, real-time vs store-and-forward remote visualisation techniques, including considerations on suitability for different tasks and environments. We then introduce the key technologies suitable for teleophthalmology: anterior segment imaging, posterior segment imaging (retinal imaging) and, briefly, radiographic/tomographic techniques. We highlight enabling factors, such as high-resolution handheld imaging, high data rate mobile transmission, cloud storage and computing, 3D printing and other rapid fabrication technologies and patient and healthcare system acceptance of remote consultations. We then briefly discuss four canonical implementation settings, namely, national service provision integration, field and community screening, optometric decision support and virtual clinics, giving representative examples. We conclude with considerations on the outlook of the field, in particular, on artificial intelligence and on robotic actuation of the patient end point as a complement to televisualisation.},

  abstract = {Aims: Using data from a large multi-centre cohort, we aimed to create a risk prediction model for large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants, using both logistic regression and naYve Bayes approaches, and compare the utility of these two approaches. Methods: We have compared the two techniques underpinning machine learning: logistic regression (LR) and naYve Bayes (NB) in terms of their ability to predict large-for gestational age (LGA) infants. Using data from five centres involved in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, we developed LR and NB models and compared the predictive ability and stability between the models. Models were developed combining the risks of hyperglycaemia (assessed in three forms: IADPSG GDM yes/no, GDM subtype, OGTT z-score quintiles), demographic and clinical variables as potential predictors. Results: The two approaches resulted in similar estimates of LGA risk (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.955, 95\% CI 0.952, 0.958) however the AUROC for the LR model was significantly higher (0.698 vs 0.682; p {$<$} 0.001). When comparing the three LR models, use of individual OGTT z-score quintiles resulted in statistically higher AUROCs than the other two models. Conclusions: Logistic regression can be used with confidence to assess the relationship between clinical and biochemical variables and outcome. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87\% with a negative predictive value of 98\% in the quarantine-center data. However, sensitivity was 0.66-0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis. Such tools can pave the path for multi-modal high throughput detection of COVID-Pneumonia in screening and referral.},

  abstract = {Medical data tampering has become one of the main challenges in the field of secure-aware medical data processing. Forgery of normal patients' medical data to present them as COVID-19 patients is an illegitimate action that has been carried out in different ways recently. Therefore, the integrity of these data can be questionable. Forgery detection is a method of detecting an anomaly in manipulated forged data. An appropriate number of features are needed to identify an anomaly as either forged or non-forged data in order to find distortion or tampering in the original data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have contributed a major breakthrough in this type of detection. There has been much interest from both the clinicians and the AI community in the possibility of widespread usage of artificial neural networks for quick diagnosis using medical data for early COVID-19 patient screening. The purpose of this paper is to detect forgery in COVID-19 medical data by using CNN in the error level analysis (ELA) by verifying the noise pattern in the data. The proposed improved ELA method is evaluated using a type of data splicing forgery and sigmoid and ReLU phenomenon schemes. The proposed method is verified by manipulating COVID-19 data using different types of forgeries and then applying the proposed CNN model to the data to detect the data tampering. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model on the test COVID-19 data is approximately 92\%.},

Male undergraduate students had the most positive view of AI (p {$<$} 0.002). Around 38\% of the students felt ill-prepared and could not answer AI-related questions because digitization in medicine and AI are not a formal part of the medical curriculum.

Of these, 43 nurses (24\% response rate) and 44 providers (41\% response rate) completed the second survey. Few (24\% nurses, 13\% providers) identified new clinical findings after responding to the alert. Perceptions of the presence of sepsis at the time of alert were discrepant between nurses (13\%) and providers (40\%). The majority of clinicians reported no change in perception of the patient's risk for sepsis (55\% nurses, 62\% providers). A third of nurses (30\%) but few providers (9\%) reported the alert changed management. Almost half of nurses (42\%) but less than a fifth of providers (16\%) found the alert helpful at 6 hours., CONCLUSIONS: In general, clinical perceptions of Early Warning System 2.0 were poor.

  abstract = {Objective Video recording and video recognition (VR) with computer vision have become widely used in many aspects of modern life. Hospitals have employed VR technology for security purposes, however, despite the growing number of studies showing the feasibility of VR software for physiologic monitoring or detection of patient movement, its use in the intensive care unit (ICU) in real-time is sparse and the perception of this novel technology is unknown. The objective of this study is to understand the attitudes of providers, patients, and patient's families toward using VR in the ICU. Design A 10-question survey instrument was used and distributed into two groups of participants: clinicians (MDs, advance practice providers, registered nurses), patients and families (adult patients and patients' relatives). Questions were specifically worded and section for free text-comments created to elicit respondents' thoughts and attitudes on potential issues and barriers toward implementation of VR in the ICU. Setting The survey was conducted at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Florida. Results A total of 233 clinicians' and 50 patients' surveys were collected. Both cohorts favored VR under specific circumstances (e.g., invasive intervention and diagnostic manipulation). Acceptable reasons for VR usage according to clinicians were anticipated positive impact on patient safety (70\%), and diagnostic suggestions and decision support (51\%). A minority of providers was concerned that artificial intelligence (AI) would replace their job (14\%) or erode professional skills (28\%). The potential use of VR in lawsuits (81\% clinicians) and privacy breaches (59\% patients) were major areas of concern. Further identified barriers were lack of trust for AI, deterioration of the patient-clinician rapport. Patients agreed with VR unless it does not reduce nursing care or record sensitive scenarios. Conclusion The survey provides valuable information on the acceptance of VR cameras in the critical care setting including an overview of real concerns and attitudes toward the use of VR technology in the ICU.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions: Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Objective: Despite artificial intelligence (AI) being used increasingly in healthcare, implementation challenges exist leading to potential biases during the clinical decision process of the practitioner. The interaction of AI with novice clinicians was investigated through an identification task, an important component of diagnosis, in dental radiography. The study evaluated the performance, efficiency, and confidence level of dental students on radiographic identification of furcation involvement (FI), with and without AI assistance. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-two third- and 19 fourth-year dental students (DS3 and DS4, respectively) completed remotely administered surveys to identify FI lesions on a series of dental radiographs. The control group received radiographs without AI assistance while the test group received the same radiographs and AI-labeled radiographs. Data were appropriately analyzed using the Chi-square, Fischer's exact, analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Result(s): Performance between groups with and without AI assistance was not statistically significant except for 1 question where tendency was to err with AI-generated answer (P {$<$}. 05). The efficiency of task completion and confidence levels was not statistically significant between groups. However, both groups with and without AI assistance believed the use of AI would improve the clinical decision-making. Discussion(s): Dental students detecting FI in radiographs with AI assistance had a tendency towards over-reliance on AI. Conclusion(s): AI input impacts clinical decision-making, which might be particularly exaggerated in novice clinicians. As it is integrated into routine clinical practice, caution must be taken to prevent overreliance on AI-generated information.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Purpose: The primary care physician's traditional patient contacts are challenged by the rapidly accelerating digital transformation. In a quantitative survey analysis based on the theory of planned behavior, we found high behavioral intention to use telemedicine among Swedish primary care physicians, but low reported use. The aim of this study was to further examine the physicians' experiences regarding telemedicine, with a focus on possible explanations for the gap between intention and use, through analysis of the free-text comments supplied in the survey. Material and Methods: The material was collected through a web-based survey which was sent out to physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The survey covered four areas: general experiences of telemedicine, digital contacts, chronic disease monitoring with digital tools, and artificial intelligence. A total of 100 physicians submitted one or more free-text comments. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach. Results: The primary care physicians expressed attitudes towards telemedicine that focused on clinical usefulness. Barriers to use were the loss of personal contact with patients and a deficient technological infrastructure. The major concerns were that these factors would result in patient harm and an increased workload. The connection between intention and use postulated by the theory of planned behavior was not applicable in this context, as external factors in the form of availability and clinical usefulness of the specific technology were major impediments to use despite a generally positive attitude. Conclusion: All telemedicine tools must be evaluated regarding clinical usefulness, patient safety, and effects on staff workload, and end users should be included in this process. Utmost consideration is needed regarding how to retain the benefits of personal contact between patient and provider when digital solutions are introduced.},

Design A retrospective, cross-sectional observational study. Setting Paediatric ED. Patients All children{$<$}16 years of age triaged between June - August 2018 were consecutively included. Primary outcome Culture-Positive Sepsis: 1) All children who received intravenous treatment for sepsis in ED and/or had a discharge diagnosis of sepsis following in-patient stay or 2) required PICU care for sepsis at point during their hospital attendance AND had positive blood cultures. Secondary outcomes Culture-negative/Clinical Sepsis: 1) All children who received intravenous treatment for sepsis in ED and/or had a discharge diagnosis of sepsis following in-patient stay or 2) required PICU care for sepsis at point during their hospital attendance BUT blood cultures. Re-attendance of any child that required sepsis bundle treatment, within 48 hours of ED attendance or in-patient discharge. Results 12301 children were included. The electronic screening tool (eST) had a 6.2\% trigger alert rate. The eST had a 100\% sensitivity and 89.8\% specificity, with 4.97\% positive predictive value (PPV) and 100\% negative predictive value (NPV). The eST when combined with focussed clinician assessment (SP) had a 97.4\% sensitivity and 99.3\% specificity, with a 45.2\% PPV and 99.9\% NPV. 1.46\% of screened children received IV treatment. The point prevalence of communityacquired sepsis in ED was 0.31\%. Conclusions We reported the implementation of a novel electronic sepsis screening tool combining clinician assessment (SP) to predict community-acquired sepsis and sepsis at the point of care at ED triage. The SP shows a high degree of accuracy for recognising sepsis at triage within a paediatric ED. Paediatric sepsis screening tools are found to be most effective when utilised in conjunction with clinician assessment. The SP would be as a feasible model for trials in further multi-centre validation studies. Clinical decision support at ED triage using Artificial Intelligence technology was proposed as a future direction for recognising paediatric sepsis in ED.},

Method: In an outpatient sample with a variety of diagnoses (n=1010), we conducted Dynamic Structural Equation Modelling to estimate within-patient cross-lagged PCE effects on outcome during the first ten sessions. In a randomly selected training sample (2/3 of the cases), we tried different machine learning algorithms (i.e., ridge regression, LASSO, elastic net, and random forest) to predict PCE effects (i.e., the degree to which PCE was a time-lagged predictor of symptoms), using baseline demographic, diagnostic, and clinically-relevant patient features. Then, we validated the best algorithm on a test sample (1/3 of the cases). Results: The random forest algorithm performed best, explaining 14.7\% of PCE effects variance in the training set. The results remained stable in the test set, explaining 15.4\% of PCE effects variance. Conclusions: The results show the suitability to perform individual predictions of process effects, based on patients’ initial information. If the results are replicated, the algorithm might have the potential to be implemented in clinical practice by integrating it into monitoring and therapist feedback systems.},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the clinical practice of radiology. This study investigated Canadian medical students’ perceptions of the impact of AI on radiology, and their influence on the students’ preference for radiology specialty. Materials and Methods In March 2018, an anonymous online survey was distributed to students at all 17 Canadian medical schools. Results Among 322 respondents, 70 students considered radiology as the top specialty choice, and 133 as among the top three choices. Only a minority (29.3\%) of respondents agreed AI would replace radiologists in foreseeable future, but a majority (67.7\%) agreed AI would reduce the demand for radiologists. Even among first-choice respondents, 48.6\% agreed AI caused anxiety when considering the radiology specialty. Furthermore, one-sixth of respondents who would otherwise rank radiology as the first choice would not consider radiology because of the anxiety about AI. Prior significant exposure to radiology and high confidence in understanding of AI were shown to decrease the anxiety level. Interested students valued the opinions of local radiologists, radiology conferences, and journals. Students were most interested in “expert opinions on AI” and “discussing AI in preclinical radiology lectures” to understand the impact of AI. Conclusion Anxiety related to “displacement” (not “replacement”) of radiologists by AI discouraged many medical students from considering the radiology specialty. The radiology community should educate medical students about the potential impact of AI, to ensure radiology is perceived as a viable long-term career choice.},

  abstract = {Objective: To characterize variation in clinical documentation production patterns, how this variation relates to individual resident behavior preferences, and how these choices relate to work hours. Materials and Methods: We used unsupervised machine learning with clinical note metadata for 1265 progress notes written for 279 patient encounters by 50 first-year residents on the Hospital Medicine service in 2018 to uncover distinct note-level and user-level production patterns. We examined average and 95\% confidence intervals of median user daily work hours measured from audit log data for each user-level production pattern. Results: Our analysis revealed 10 distinct note-level and 5 distinct user-level production patterns (user styles). Note production patterns varied in when writing occurred and in how dispersed writing was through the day. User styles varied in which note production pattern(s) dominated. We observed suggestive trends in work hours for different user styles: residents who preferred producing notes in dispersed sessions had higher median daily hours worked while residents who preferred producing notes in the morning or in a single uninterrupted session had lower median daily hours worked. Discussion: These relationships suggest that note writing behaviors should be further investigated to understand what practices could be targeted to reduce documentation burden and derivative outcomes such as resident work hour violations. Conclusion: Clinical note documentation is a time-consuming activity for physicians; we identify substantial variation in how first-year residents choose to do this work and suggestive trends between user preferences and work hours.},

  abstract = {Purpose. By comparing the performance of different models between artificial intelligence (AI) and doctors, we aim to evaluate and identify the optimal model for future usage of AI. Methods. A total of 500 fundus images of glaucoma and 500 fundus images of normal eyes were collected and randomly divided into five groups, with each group corresponding to one round. The AI system provided diagnostic suggestions for each image. Four doctors provided diagnoses without the assistance of the AI in the first round and with the assistance of the AI in the second and third rounds. In the fourth round, doctor B and doctor D made diagnoses with the help of the AI and the other two doctors without the help of the AI. In the last round, doctor A and doctor B made diagnoses with the help of AI and the other two doctors without the help of the AI. Results. Doctor A, doctor B, and doctor D had a higher accuracy in the diagnosis of glaucoma with the assistance of AI in the second (p=0.036, p=0.003, and p {$<$}= 0.000) and the third round (p=0.021, p {$<$}= 0.000, and p {$<$}= 0.000) than in the first round. The accuracy of at least one doctor was higher than that of AI in the second and third rounds, in spite of no detectable significance (p=0.283, p=0.727, p=0.344, and p=0.508). The four doctors' overall accuracy (p=0.004 and p \& LE;0.000) and sensitivity (p=0.006 and p \& LE;0.000) as a whole were significantly improved in the second and third rounds. Conclusions. This "Doctor + AI " model can clarify the role of doctors and AI in medical responsibility and ensure the safety of patients, and importantly, this model shows great potential and application prospects.},

For this reason, we shared the first results of the Pediatric Atelier experience that we realized through telegram application. We make an online survey to investigate the needs, requirements, pleasure, and suggestions of members through a web-based questionnaire. This cross-sectional survey study was delivered only to participants who were members of the workshop via their email addresses. Online questionnaires organized using Google Forms were sent to pediatric workshop members between March and June 2019. The questionnaire consisted of questions that measured the participants' basic demographic data, the use of the workshop, and the overall impact of the workshop on their professional behavior. While the institutions and positions of the participants were recorded, no other personal data (such as address and telephone) were collected. Among the 997 members, 417 (42\%) of them answered the questionnaire. Respondents included 300 (72\%) pediatrician, 21 (5\%) pediatric subspeciality fellows, and 75 (18\%) pediatric subspecialists. Of the 417 respondents, 217 (52\%) were working in Istanbul, and 200 (48\%) were working in other cities of Turkey. Among the responders, 233 (56\%) were working in private hospitals or doctor offices. A total of 520 cases were consulted in 241 days of study period. Most consultations (n=309, \%59) were made from the Istanbul metropolitan area, and 203 (40\%) consultations were from other cities of Turkey. The most frequently consulted departments were Pediatric infectious diseases: 166 (32\%), Pediatric hematology and oncology: 56 (11\%), and Neonatology: 43 (8\%). Of the 520 consulted cases, 44 (8\%) were related to life-threatening events, and 25 of them were hospitalized in the intensive care units, and 6 of them were required surgical operations. Of the 94\% of responders thought this platform was useful and 82\% of them stated that the case counseling part of the atelier was the most useful part.

  abstract = {Introduction. Current clinical practice is based on guidelines and local protocols that are informed by clinical evidence. This means that clinical variability is reduced, but can lead to inefficient clinical decision-making, and can increase medical errors, decreasing patient's safety. The aim of the EXCON project is to investigate the innovative concept of Intelligent Clinical History (ICH), and to develop functional prototypes of high added-value in healthcare services. Methods. The innovative EXCON project will take advantage of recent advances in technologies for coding, structuring and semantizing medical information. Thanks to this new structuring, the EXCON platform will be developed. Final users will be health professionals and other decision-makers. Doctors, nurses, epidemiologists and information specialists will be involved in the development and subsequent validation of the platforms. Results. To develop the ICH platform clinical data on a highly prevalent symptom with high variability in clinical practice, such as non-traumatic chest pain in emergency services, has been collected from different electronic medical record databases. The extraction of clinical data to implement new techniques of artificial intelligence requires tasks that must be automated, which today is difficult and tedious (data is often not computerized). Through techniques applied in EXCON, such as natural language processing, relevant clinical data have been extracted and a Decision Support System has been developed and validated. This tool optimizes resources and improves clinical management, reducing errors and increasing patient's safety. Conclusions. In coming decades, patient management will be impacted by the application of new advanced data analytics tools. This will allow for safer and more efficient clinical management, decrease variability in clinical practice, and improve equity. That is why the development and assessment of these technologies is necessary.},

  abstract = {Healthcare providers all over the world are faced with a single challenge: the need to improve patient outcomes while containing costs. Drivers include an increasing demand for chronic disease management for an aging population, technological advancements and empowered patients taking control of their health experience. The digital transformation in healthcare, through the creation of a rich health data foundation and integration of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is recognized as a key component to tackle these challenges. It can lead to improvements in diagnostics, prevention and patient therapy, ultimately empowering care givers to use an evidence-based approach to improve clinical decisions. Real-time interactions allow a physician to monitor a patient 'live', instead of interactions once every few weeks. Operational intelligence ensures efficient utilization of healthcare resources and services provided, thereby optimizing costs. However, procedure-based payments, legacy systems, disparate data sources with the limited adoption of data standards, technical debt, data security and privacy concerns impede the efficient usage of health information to maximize value creation for all healthcare stakeholders. This has led to a highly-regulated, constrained industry. Ultimately, the goal is to improve quality of life and saving people's lives through the creation of the intelligent healthcare provider, fully enabled to deliver value-based healthcare and a seamless patient experience. Information technologies that enable this goal must be extensible, safe, reliable and affordable, and tailored to the digitalization maturity-level of the individual organization.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: The Poisson noise is added to the image during the acquisition of medical X-Ray images. The distorted image due to this noise makes it difficult for physicians to diagnose the disease. Although there are various approaches for filtering Poisson noise, these approaches have disadvantages such as excessive smoothing of the image, distorting the texture information, reducing the image quality and high computational cost. In this study, a novel method that removes Poisson noise from medical X-Ray images is proposed by overcoming the above mentioned disadvantages. Methods: In the proposed method, the Wiener filter is modified using the FIR filter embedded in the standard Wiener algorithm. The FIR filter design was carried out using the ASO optimization algorithm. Optimum local mean and optimum local variance values are calculated using the optimization matrix corresponding to the FIR filter coefficients and transferred to the standart Wiener filter layer as parameter inputs. Results: The proposed method showed superior performance in synthetic images and medical X-Ray images in terms of PSNR, MSE, SSIM metrics and image quality metrics such as luminous intensity, Contrast index, Entropy and Sharpness. The time consumption of the proposed method is much less. Conclusions: The clinical usage of the proposed method may help doctors to be able to diagnose the disease more accurately by interpreting the X-ray images. Besides, the proposed method can also have a positive effect on the CAD performance by using it at the pre-processing stage of CAD systems.},

AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing.

This systematic scoping review aims to systematically capture the scope of artificial intelligence methods used in outcomes research to enhance decision-makers' knowledge and broaden perspectives for health technology assessment and adoption. Areas covered: The review identified 370 studies, consisted of artificial intelligence methods applied to adult patients who underwent any health/medical intervention and reported therapeutic, preventive, or prognostic outcomes. Artificial intelligence was mainly used for the prediction/prognosis of more frequently reported outcomes, efficacy/effectiveness, among morbidity outcomes. The predictive analysis was common in neoplastic disorders. Neural networks algorithm was predominantly found in surgical method studies, but a mixture of artificial intelligence algorithms was applied to the studies with the rest of the interventions. Expert opinion: There are certain gaps in artificial intelligence applications used in outcomes research across therapeutic areas and further considerations are needed by decision-makers before incorporating artificial intelligence usage into HTA decision-making processes.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can provide assistance for personalized diagnosis and treatment decisions. Suchlike systems are expected to play an increasingly important role in future healthcare. Especially data-driven approaches, employing data mining and machine learning techniques to exploit the large volume of daily captured clinical data, promise to open up new perspectives. Deriving decisions based on a patient's neighbourhood is one strategy for data-driven decision support. This work investigates the impact of neighbourhood determination in a therapy recommendation system based on collaborative filetring (CF). The proposed memory-based CF model incorporates the individual therapy history, as well as demographic and condition related data to predict the outcome of systemic treatment options to treat patients suffering from the skin disease Psoriasis. Based on those outcome estimates, a list of the top-N-ranked therapies can be presented to the attending physician. Outcome predictions in suchlike CF approaches highly depend on the local neighbourhood included into the estimation. We compare two methods that both adapt an optimized similarity metric to the data at hand in order to determine this neighborhood. On the one hand, a Relief-based algorithm (RBA) is implemented. Based on supervised information, the method optimizes the individual attributes' weights, i.e. is the attributes' impact on the similarity computed between data samples. On the other hand, a metric learning approach is investigated. The proposed method adapts and applies a linear transformation to the available data based on supervised information prior to computing similarity. Both approaches are evaluated according to the accuracy of the**outcome predictions (RMSE) and the quality of the ranked list of recommendations (MAP@3). The metric learning approach outperforms the RBA. It is, however, inferior regarding interpretability and explainability of the generated recommedations.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine the effect of a domain-specific ontology and machine learning-driven user interfaces on the efficiency and quality of documentation of presenting problems (chief complaints) in the emergency department (ED). Methods: As part of a quality improvement project, we simultaneously implemented three interventions: a domain-specific ontology, contextual autocomplete, and top five suggestions. Contextual autocomplete is a user interface that ranks concepts by their predicted probability which helps nurses enter data about a patient's presenting problems. Nurses were also given a list of top five suggestions to choose from. These presenting problems were represented using a consensus ontology mapped to SNOMED CT. Predicted probabilities were calculated using a previously derived model based on triage vital signs and a brief free text note. We evaluated the percentage and quality of structured data captured using a mixed methods retrospective before-and-after study design. Results: A total of 279,231 consecutive patient encounters were analyzed. Structured data capture improved from 26.2\% to 97.2\% (p {$<$} 0.0001). During the post-implementation period, presenting problems were more complete (3.35 vs 3.66; p = 0.0004) and higher in overall quality (3.38 vs. 3.72; p = 0.0002), but showed no difference in precision (3.59 vs. 3.74; p = 0.1). Our system reduced the mean number of keystrokes required to document a presenting problem from 11.6 to 0.6 (p {$<$} 0.0001), a 95\% improvement. Discussion: We demonstrated a technique that captures structured data on nearly all patients. We estimate that our system reduces the number of man-hours required annually to type presenting problems at our institution from 92.5 h to 4.8 h. Conclusion: Implementation of a domain-specific ontology and machine learning-driven user interfaces resulted in improved structured data capture, ontology usage compliance, and data quality.},

  abstract = {Background: Many promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level. Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs—video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing—using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.},

Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even unrepresentative of real world usage by the lack of distinction between thedifferent types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation of metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript introduces a new framework in three parts.

(Part 2) Metrics: discussed and reviewed for a rigorous evaluation including recommendations for NER/Geoparsing practitioners. (Part 3) Evaluation data: shared via a new dataset calledGeoWebNewsto provide test/train examples and enable immediate use of our contributions.

  abstract = {Pattern recognition and automatic decision support methods provide significant advantages in the area of health protection. The aim of this work is to develop a low-cost tool for monitoring arteriovenous fistula (AVF) with the use of phono-angiography method. This article presents a developed and diagnostic device that implements classification algorithms to identify 38 patients with end stage renal disease, chronically hemodialysed using an AVF, at risk of vascular access stenosis. We report on the design, fabrication, and preliminary testing of a prototype device for non-invasive diagnosis which is very important for hemodialysed patients. The system includes three sub-modules: AVF signal acquisition, information processing and classification and a unit for presenting results. This is a non-invasive and inexpensive procedure for evaluating the sound pattern of bruit produced by AVF. With a special kind of head which has a greater sensitivity than conventional stethoscope, a sound signal from fistula was recorded. The proces of signal acquisition was performed by a dedicated software, written specifically for the purpose of our study. From the obtained phono-angiogram, 23 features were isolated for vectors used in a decision-making algorithm, including 6 features based on the waveform of time domain, and 17 features based on the frequency spectrum. Final definition of the feature vector composition was obtained by using several selection methods: the feature-class correlation, forward search, Principal Component Analysis and Joined-Pairs method. The supervised machine learning technique was then applied to develop the best classification model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain undiagnosed despite availability of interventions to reduce stroke risk. Predictive models to date are limited by data requirements and theoretical usage. We aimed to develop a model for predicting the 2-year probability of AF diagnosis and implement it as proof-of-concept (POC) in a production electronic health record (EHR)., METHODS: We used a nested case-control design using data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care. The development cohort came from 2016 to 2017 (outcome period) and 2014 to 2015 (baseline). A separate validation cohort used outcome and baseline periods shifted 2 years before respective development cohort times. Machine learning approaches were used to build predictive model. Patients {$>$}= 18 years, later restricted to age {$>$}= 40 years, with at least two encounters and no AF during baseline, were included. In the 6-week EHR prospective pilot, the model was silently implemented in the production system at a large safety-net urban hospital. Three new and two previous logistic regression models were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics. Number, characteristics, and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of patients identified by the model in the pilot are presented., RESULTS: After restricting age to {$>$}= 40 years, 31,474 AF cases (mean age, 71.5 years; female 49\%) and 22,078 controls (mean age, 59.5 years; female 61\%) comprised the development cohort. A 10-variable model using age, acute heart disease, albumin, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gender, heart failure, insurance, kidney disease, and shock yielded the best performance (C-statistic, 0.80 [95\% CI 0.79-0.80]). The model performed well in the validation cohort (C-statistic, 0.81 [95\% CI 0.8-0.81]). In the EHR pilot, 7916/22,272 (35.5\%; mean age, 66 years; female 50\%) were identified as higher risk for AF; 5582 (70\%) had CHA2DS2-VASc score {$>$}= 2., CONCLUSIONS: Using variables commonly available in the EHR, we created a predictive model to identify 2-year risk of developing AF in those previously without diagnosed AF. Successful POC implementation of the model in an EHR provided a practical strategy to identify patients who may benefit from interventions to reduce their stroke risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To take full advantage of decision support, machine learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important that models are not only created, but also deployed in a clinical setting. The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment., METHODS: The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting., RESULTS: We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals., CONCLUSION: The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) into molecular cancer diagnostics has led to an increase in the data available for the identification and evaluation of driver mutations and for defining personalized cancer treatment regimens. The meaningful combination of omics data, ie, pathogenic gene variants and alterations with other patient data, to understand the full picture of malignancy has been challenging., OBJECTIVE: This study describes the implementation of a system capable of processing, analyzing, and subsequently combining NGS data with other clinical patient data for analysis within and across institutions., METHODS: On the basis of the already existing NGS analysis workflows for the identification of malignant gene variants at the Institute of Pathology of the University Hospital Erlangen, we defined basic requirements on an NGS processing and analysis pipeline and implemented a pipeline based on the GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) open source genetic variation database. For the purpose of validation, this pipeline was applied to data from the 1000 Genomes Project and subsequently to NGS data derived from 206 patients of a local hospital. We further integrated the pipeline into existing structures of data integration centers at the University Hospital Erlangen and combined NGS data with local nongenomic patient-derived data available in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format., RESULTS: Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and from the patient cohort as input, the implemented system produced the same results as already established methodologies. Further, it satisfied all our identified requirements and was successfully integrated into the existing infrastructure. Finally, we showed in an exemplary analysis how the data could be quickly loaded into and analyzed in KETOS, a web-based analysis platform for statistical analysis and clinical decision support., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the GEMINI open source database can be augmented to create an NGS analysis pipeline. The pipeline generates high-quality results consistent with the already established workflows for gene variant annotation and pathological evaluation. We further demonstrate how NGS-derived genomic and other clinical data can be combined for further statistical analysis, thereby providing for data integration using standardized vocabularies and methods. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the pipeline integration into hospital workflows by providing an exemplary integration into the data integration center infrastructure, which is currently being established across Germany.

  abstract = {The acceptance and increasing utilization of technological innovations in health care are crucially beneficial for both health care professionals and patients during the diagnosis and treatment processes. The literature includes various intervention programs aiming to increase technology acceptance in this field. In this review, studies investigating the factors influencing the technology acceptance and recent interventions intending to enhance the technology usage in the field are covered. Generally, theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and unified theory of technology acceptance cover the most distinguished concepts and constructs to understand attitudes towards technological innovations. Influencing factors may differ for health care professionals and patients. While perceived benefits of technological innovations may be the most distinctive factor for health care professionals, ease of use is of big importance for patients. Perceived ease of use is affected by personal norms and perceived control beliefs. Suspicions of confidentiality and privacy are strong influencing factors for refusing technology usage for patients. Considering all these factors are necessary while designing intervention programs to enhance technology acceptance in health care. In the conclusion, the paper discusses whether the intervention programs originate from previously covered theoretical concepts and constructs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a serious cardiac condition that brings high risks of urgent hospitalization and death. Remote monitoring systems are well-suited to managing patients suffering from CHF, and can reduce deaths and re-hospitalizations, as shown by the literature, including multiple systematic reviews., METHODS: The monitoring system proposed in this paper aims at helping CHF stakeholders make appropriate decisions in managing the disease and preventing cardiac events, such as decompensation, which can lead to hospitalization or death. Monitoring activities are stratified into three layers: scheduled visits to a hospital following up on a cardiac event, home monitoring visits by nurses, and patient's self-monitoring performed at home using specialized equipment. Appropriate hardware, desktop and mobile software applications were developed to enable a patient's monitoring by all stakeholders. For the first two layers, we designed and implemented a Decision Support System (DSS) using machine learning (Random Forest algorithm) to predict the number of decompensations per year and to assess the heart failure severity based on a variety of clinical data. For the third layer, custom-designed sensors (the Blue Scale system) for electrocardiogram (EKG), pulse transit times, bio-impedance and weight allowed frequent collection of CHF-related data in the comfort of the patient's home. We also performed a short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis on electrocardiograms self-acquired by 15 healthy volunteers and compared the obtained parameters with those of 15 CHF patients from PhysioNet's PhysioBank archives., RESULTS: We report numerical performances of the DSS, calculated as multiclass accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in a 10-fold cross-validation. The obtained average accuracies are: 71.9\% in predicting the number of decompensations and 81.3\% in severity assessment. The most serious class in severity assessment is detected with good sensitivity and specificity (0.87 / 0.95), while, in predicting decompensation, high specificity combined with good sensitivity prevents false alarms. The HRV parameters extracted from the self-measured EKG using the Blue Scale system of sensors are comparable with those reported in the literature about healthy people., CONCLUSIONS: The performance of DSSs trained with new patients confirmed the results of previous work, and emphasizes the strong correlation between some CHF markers, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and ejection fraction (EF), with the outputs of interest. Comparing HRV parameters from healthy volunteers with HRV parameters obtained from PhysioBank archives, we confirm the literature that considers the HRV a promising method for distinguishing healthy from CHF patients.},

  abstract = {Background: Patient selection for reperfusion therapies requires significant expertise in neuroimaging. Increasingly, machine learning-based analysis is used for faster and standardized patient selection. However, there is little information on how such software influences real-world patient management. Aim(s): We evaluated changes in thrombolysis and thrombectomy delivery following implementation of automated analysis at a high volume primary stroke centre. Method(s): We retrospectively collected data on consecutive stroke patients admitted to a large university stroke centre from two identical 7-month periods in 2017 and 2018 between which the e-Stroke Suite (Brainomix, Oxford, UK) was implemented to analyse non-contrast CT and CT angiography results. Delivery of stroke care was otherwise unchanged. Patients were transferred to a hub for thrombectomy. We collected the number of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy, the time to treatment; and outcome at 90 days for thrombectomy. Result(s): 399 patients from 2017 and 398 from 2018 were included in the study. From 2017 to 2018, thrombolysis rates increased from 11.5\% to 18.1\% with a similar trend for thrombectomy (2.8-4.8\%). There was a trend towards shorter door-to-needle times (44-42 min) and CT-to-groin puncture times (174-145 min). There was a non-significant trend towards improved outcomes with thrombectomy. Qualitatively, physician feedback suggested that e-Stroke Suite increased decision-making confidence and improved patient flow. Conclusion(s): Use of artificial intelligence decision support in a hyperacute stroke pathway facilitates decision-making and can improve rate and time of reperfusion therapies in a hub-and-spoke system of care.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Objectives: Extracting useful visual clues from medical images allowing accurate diagnoses requires physicians' domain knowledge acquired through years of systematic study and clinical training. This is especially true in the dermatology domain, a medical specialty that requires physicians to have image inspection experience. Automating or at least aiding such efforts requires understanding physicians' reasoning processes and their use of domain knowledge. Mining physicians' references to medical concepts in narratives during image-based diagnosis of a disease is an interesting research topic that can help reveal experts' reasoning processes. It can also be a useful resource to assist with design of information technologies for image use and for image case-based medical education systems. Methods and materials: We collected data for analyzing physicians' diagnostic reasoning processes by conducting an experiment that recorded their spoken descriptions during inspection of dermatology images. In this paper we focus on the benefit of physicians' spoken descriptions and provide a general workflow for mining medical domain knowledge based on linguistic data from these narratives. The challenge of a medical image case can influence the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as how physicians pursue the diagnostic process. Accordingly, we define two lexical metrics for physicians' narratives lexical consensus score and top N relatedness score and evaluate their usefulness by assessing the diagnostic challenge levels of corresponding medical images. We also report on clustering medical images based on anchor concepts obtained from physicians' medical term usage. These analyses are based on physicians' spoken narratives that have been preprocessed by incorporating the Unified Medical Language System for detecting medical concepts. Results: The image rankings based on lexical consensus score and on top 1 relatedness score are well correlated with those based on challenge levels (Spearman correlation {$>$}0.5 and Kendall correlation {$>$}0.4). Clustering results are largely improved based on our anchor concept method (accuracy {$>$}70\% and mutual information {$>$}80\%). Conclusions: Physicians' spoken narratives are valuable for the purpose of mining the domain knowledge that physicians use in medical image inspections. We also show that the semantic metrics introduced in the paper can be successfully applied to medical image understanding and allow discussion},

  abstract = {Background: The occurrence of aggressive behaviour in hospital is considered common and it is difficult to predict. Despite identifying several contributing factors towards aggressive behaviour in hospital inpatients, it remains difficult to predict, and the consequences can be dramatic. Patients who demonstrate aggressive behaviours in hospital are more likely to have protracted admissions, will require more resources and are likely to have worse overall outcomes compared to non-aggressive patients. Objective(s): To improve accuracy in predicting factors leading to aggressive behaviours in hospital using artificial intelligence (AI) principles and to implement clinical interventions to address this risk efficiently. Thus, we hope to enable treatment diversion that is targeted more appropriately to those patients with risk of aggressive behaviours to facilitate a positive experience of the healthcare system for both patients and staff. Method(s): Aggressive behaviour is difficult to predict in health consumers and results in a greater burden on psychiatric resources in the medical setting. Using existing data, we developed an AI prototype that can facilitate quicker and more accurate decision-making by clinicians when a consumer presents with potential behavioural issues leading to aggressive behaviours later in their treatment. Finding(s): Our tool demonstrated an ability to enhance clinician performance by providing timely, reliable clinical decision support using AI technologies. Conclusion(s): This project, when completed, is expected to provide a reliable diagnostic tool based on demonstrated AI techniques to assist clinicians in identifying risk factors for aggressive behaviours early in treatment.},

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.},

  abstract = {AI model development for synthetic data generation to improve Machine Learning (ML) methodologies is an integral part of research in Computer Science and is currently being transferred to related medical fields, such as Systems Medicine and Medical Informatics. In general, the idea of personalized decision-making support based on patient data has driven the motivation of researchers in the medical domain for more than a decade, but the overall sparsity and scarcity of data are still major limitations. This is in contrast to currently applied technology that allows us to generate and analyze patient data in diverse forms, such as tabular data on health records, medical images, genomics data, or even audio and video. One solution arising to overcome these data limitations in relation to medical records is the synthetic generation of tabular data based on real world data. Consequently, ML-assisted decision-support can be interpreted more conveniently, using more relevant patient data at hand. At a methodological level, several state-of-the-art ML algorithms generate and derive decisions from such data. However, there remain key issues that hinder a broad practical implementation in real-life clinical settings. In this review, we will give for the first time insights towards current perspectives and potential impacts of using synthetic data generation in palliative care screening because it is a challenging prime example of highly individualized, sparsely available patient information. Taken together, the reader will obtain initial starting points and suitable solutions relevant for generating and using synthetic data for ML-based screenings in palliative care and beyond.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

There has been development of a variety of health-related smartphone applications. Currently, however, there are few to none applications based on nurses' historical or behavioral preferences. Mobile application development for the health care sector requires extensive attention to security, reliability, and accuracy. In nursing applications, the users are often required to navigate in hospital environments, select patients to support, read the patient history and set action points to assist the patient during their shift. Finally, they have to report their performance on patient related activities and other relevant information before they leave for the day. In a working day, a nurse often visits different locations such as the patient's room, different laboratories, and offices for filling reports. There is still a limited capability to access context relevant information on a smartphone with minimal recourse such as Wi-Fi triangulation. The Wi-Fi triangulation signals fluctuate significantly for indoor location positioning. Therefore, providing relevant location based services to a mobile subscriber has become challenging. This paper addresses this gap by applying machine learning and behavior analysis to anticipate the potential location of the nurse and provide the required services. The application concept was already presented at the IMCOM 2015 conference. This paper focuses on the process to ascertain a user's context, the process of analyzing and predicting user behavior, and finally, the process of displaying the information through a dynamically generated UI.},

Complementary to clinical data, CT examinations show significant add-on values for the prediction of COVID-19 progression in the early stage of COVID-19, especially in the 6(th) to 8(th) day after the symptom onset, indicating that this is the ideal time window for the introduction of CT examinations.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of demand in eye care services in the UK. With a large proportion of patients referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management, the referral process results in unnecessary referrals from erroneous diagnoses and delays in access to appropriate treatment. A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and human-computer interaction (HCI) analyses., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee (REC 20/LO/1299).

The choice of corporate financing methods is an important part of organizational behavioral psychology, and different financing models will have a certain effect on organizational performance, especially in the digital economy environment. Therefore, based on resource dependence theory and financing constraint theory, the present study utilizes the panel data collected from the China Stock Market \& Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2011 to 2020 of 112 companies in the Yangtze River Delta region and the "The Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)" released by the Peking University Digital Finance Research Center and Ant Financial Group. The results show that the Digital Financial Inclusion Index (DFIIC) has a significant positive correlation with the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises. The higher the level of debt financing, the stronger the role of digital financial inclusion in promoting innovation performance. Investigating the DFIIC in terms of coverage breadth and usage depth, we find that usage depth does not significantly encourage innovation performance. The effect of the interaction between coverage breadth and external financing is consistent with the results for the DFIIC. The study suggests that equity financing promotes the usage depth of the DFIIC in state-owned enterprises. In contrast, debt financing promotes the coverage breadth of non-state-owned enterprises. Finally, we propose relevant policy recommendations based on the research results. It includes in-depth popularization of inclusive finance in the daily operations of enterprises at the technical level, refinement of external financing policy incentives for enterprises based on the characteristics of ownership, and strengthening the research of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. The paper presents a range of theoretical and practical implications for practitioners and academics relevant to high-tech enterprises.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate antithrombotic (AT) use in individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at high risk of stroke (CHA 2DS 2-VASc score {$>$}= 2) and investigate whether pre-existing AT use may improve COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Individuals with AF and CHA 2DS 2-VASc score {$>$}= 2 on 1 January 2020 were identified using electronic health records for 56 million people in England and were followed up until 1 May 2021. Factors associated with pre-existing AT use were analysed using logistic regression. Differences in COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death were analysed using logistic and Cox regression in individuals with pre-existing AT use versus no AT use, anticoagulants (AC) versus antiplatelets (AP), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus warfarin. Results From 972 971 individuals with AF (age 79 (+/- 9.3), female 46.2\%) and CHA 2DS 2-VASc score {$>$}= 2, 88.0\% (n=856 336) had pre-existing AT use, 3.8\% (n=37 418) had a COVID-19 hospitalisation and 2.2\% (n=21 116) died, followed up to 1 May 2021. Factors associated with no AT use included comorbidities that may contraindicate AT use (liver disease and history of falls) and demographics (socioeconomic status and ethnicity). Pre-existing AT use was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.92, 95\% CI 0.87 to 0.96), but higher odds of hospitalisation (OR=1.20, 95\% CI 1.15 to 1.26). AC versus AP was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.93, 95\% CI 0.87 to 0.98) and higher hospitalisation (OR=1.17, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.24). For DOACs versus warfarin, lower odds were observed for hospitalisation (OR=0.86, 95\% CI 0.82 to 0.89) but not for death (OR=1.00, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.05). Conclusions Pre-existing AT use may be associated with lower odds of COVID-19 death and, while not evidence of causality, provides further incentive to improve AT coverage for eligible individuals with AF.},

Data Sources: The MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected articles, and current texts on the subject. Study Selection: The studies that were selected for review used artificial intelligence tools for a variety of intensive care applications, including direct patient care and retrospective database analysis. Data Extraction: All literature relevant to the topic was reviewed. Data Synthesis: Although some of the earliest artificial intelligence (AI) applications were medically oriented, AI has not been widely accepted in medicine. Despite this, patient demographic, clinical, and billing data are increasingly available in an electronic format and therefore susceptible to analysis by intelligent software. Individual AI tools are specifically suited to different tasks, such as waveform analysis or device control. Conclusion(s): The intensive care environment is particularly suited to the implementation of AI tools because of the wealth of available data and the inherent opportunities for increased efficiency in inpatient care. A variety of new AI tools have become available in recent years that can function as intelligent assistants to clinicians, constantly monitoring electronic data streams for important trends, or adjusting the settings of bedside devices. The integration of these tools into the intensive care unit can be expected to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Estimates in a 1989 study indicated that physicians in the United States were unable to reach a diagnosis that accounted for their patient's symptoms in up to 90\% of outpatient patient encounters. Many proponents of artificial intelligence (AI) see the current process of moving from clinical data gathering to medical diagnosis as being limited by human analytic capability and expect AI to be a valuable tool to refine this process. The use of AI fundamentally calls into question the extent to which uncertainty in medical decision making is tolerated. Uncertainty is perceived by some as fundamentally undesirable and thus, for them, optimal decision making should be based on minimizing uncertainty. However, uncertainty cannot be reduced to zero; thus, relative uncertainty can be used as a metric to weigh the likelihood of various diagnoses being correct and the appropriateness of treatments. Here, the authors make the argument, using as examples the experiences of 2 AI systems, IBM Watson on Jeopardy and Watson for Oncology, that medical decision making based on relative uncertainty provides a better lens for understanding the application of AI to medicine than one that minimizes uncertainty. This approach to uncertainty has significant implications for how health care leaders consider the benefits and trade-offs of AI-assisted and AI-driven decision tools and ultimately integrate AI into medical practice.Copyright © 2020 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.},

Implementing these algorithms to enhance clinical care and reduce suicide has not been well studied., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design a clinical decision support tool and appropriate care pathways for community-based suicide surveillance and case management systems operating on Native American reservations., METHODS: Participants included Native American case managers and supervisors (N=9) who worked on suicide surveillance and case management programs on 2 Native American reservations. We used in-depth interviews to understand how case managers think about and respond to suicide risk. The results from interviews informed a draft clinical decision support tool, which was then reviewed with supervisors and combined with appropriate care pathways., RESULTS: Case managers reported acceptance of risk flags based on a predictive algorithm in their surveillance system tools, particularly if the information was available in a timely manner and used in conjunction with their clinical judgment. Implementation of risk flags needed to be programmed on a dichotomous basis, so the algorithm could produce output indicating high versus low risk. To dichotomize the continuous predicted probabilities, we developed a cutoff point that favored specificity, with the understanding that case managers' clinical judgment would help increase sensitivity., CONCLUSIONS: Suicide risk prediction algorithms show promise, but implementation to guide clinical care remains relatively elusive. Our study demonstrates the utility of working with partners to develop and guide the operationalization of risk prediction algorithms to enhance clinical care in a community setting.

Compounding the issue, research on the use of technology in sales curriculum is underdeveloped. In a comprehensive review of the sales education literature, one study identified that only six articles on sales technology were published in major marketing education journals from 1979 to 2013. In an effort to bridge the gap between critical industry competencies and marketing curriculum, understanding the impact of technology use and training is important for educational planning and student development. Using a survey of 82 salespeople in the United States, the current study empirically evaluates how use of technologically advanced CRM features influences self-perception of CRM knowledge, the perception that additional technology training would be beneficial, and adaptive selling performance of sales practitioners. A majority of survey respondents in the current study cited a need for college students to receive increased exposure to advanced CRM technology training and skill development. We propose an experiential learning approach to teach marketing college students advanced CRM features to help them bolster their effectiveness and value in the workplace.},

Recent Findings: The greatest issue in breast screening is a workforce crisis across the UK, much of Europe and even Japan. Traditional computer-aided detection (CAD) for mammography decision-support could not reach the level of an independent reader. Deep learning (DL) outperforms CAD and is close to surpassing human performance. DL is already capable of decision support and density assessment for 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM), and is on the cusp of providing consistent, accurate and interpretable mammography reading as an independent reader. Summary: A bold vision for the future of breast cancer screening is required if programmes are to maintain double reading standards. DL provides the potential for single reading programmes, such as in the USA, to reach EU double reading accuracy, as well as providing practical support for adoption of the emerging modality of digital breast tomosynthesis.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon was developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7\% to approximately 10\% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70\%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk., METHODS: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores., RESULTS: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100\%, whereas the specificity was 74\%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81\%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93., CONCLUSION: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy.},

Yet the deviation between online doctor reviews and the true quality of doctor-provided online services calls the usefulness of online doctor reviews into question, and the methods for reducing this deviation via doctor-patient communication remain unclear.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the effects of interactive factors on online doctor review deviation and to further explore deviation across doctor specialties in the context of one-to-one online health consultations.Methods: We collect our data from a well-known Chinese online health consultation platform. The dataset in-cludes 60,693 one-to-one online health consultation communication flows and corresponding online doctor reviews. We construct an online doctor review deviation matrix and use logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression models to examine the effects of interactive factors on online doctor review deviation.Results: Our findings indicate that, in the context of a one-to-one online health consultation, a quicker response time and a lower response-question ratio could reduce deviation in online doctor reviews. Single modalities, such as the use of voice messages and uploading of photos, could reduce online doctor review deviation, especially in terms of patient overestimation. Medical information, including structural medical history and prescription in-formation, could decrease online doctor review deviation. Moreover, the use of voice messages in surgery patient treatment can reduce online doctor review deviation more than in internal medicine.Conclusion: Interaction frequency, message delivery methods, and medical information can influence the devi-ation of online doctor reviews. Furthermore, the effects of voice messages vary across doctor specialties.

  abstract = {Epidemics of infectious diseases are usually recognized by an observation of an abnormal cluster of cases. Usually, the recognition is not automated, and relies on the alertness of human health care workers. This can lead to significant delays in detection. Since real-time data from the physicians' offices is not available. However, in Finland a Web-based collection of guidelines for primary care exists, and increases in queries concerning certain disease have been shown to correlate to epidemics. We introduce a simple method for automated online mining of probable epidemics from the log of this database. The method is based on deriving a smoothed time series from the data, on using a flexible selection of data for comparison, and on applying randomization statistics to estimate the significance of findings. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that the method can provide accurate and early detection of epidemics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support bedside clinical decisions, but information must be presented in usable ways within workflow. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are front-facing presentations for communicating AI outputs, but clinicians are not routinely invited to participate in their design, hindering AI solution potential., PURPOSE: To inform early user-engaged design of a GUI prototype aimed at predicting future Cardiorespiratory Insufficiency (CRI) by exploring clinician methods for identifying at-risk patients, previous experience with implementing new technologies into clinical workflow, and user perspectives on GUI screen changes., METHODS: We conducted a qualitative focus group study to elicit iterative design feedback from clinical end-users on an early GUI prototype display. Five online focus group sessions were held, each moderated by an expert focus group methodologist. Iterative design changes were made sequentially, and the updated GUI display was presented to the next group of participants., RESULTS: 23 clinicians were recruited (14 nurses, 4 nurse practitioners, 5 physicians; median participant age \textasciitilde 35 years; 60\% female; median clinical experience 8 years). Five themes emerged from thematic content analysis: trend evolution, context (risk evolution relative to vital signs and interventions), evaluation/interpretation/explanation (sub theme: continuity of evaluation), clinician intuition, and clinical operations. Based on these themes, GUI display changes were made. For example, color and scale adjustments, integration of clinical information, and threshold personalization., CONCLUSIONS: Early user-engaged design was useful in adjusting GUI presentation of AI output. Next steps involve clinical testing and further design modification of the AI output to optimally facilitate clinician surveillance and decisions. Clinicians should be involved early and often in clinical decision support design to optimize efficacy of AI tools. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Siemens AI Pathway Companion is a decision support tool that provides physicians with comprehensive patient information from various systems. In the present study, we examined the impact of providing organized patient information in comprehensive dashboards on information quality, effectiveness, and satisfaction of physicians in the clinical decision-making process. Methods Ten urologists in our department performed the entire diagnostic workup to treatment decision for 10 patients in the prostate cancer screening setting. Expenditure of time, information quality, and user satisfaction during the decision-making process with AI Pathway Companion were recorded and compared to the current workflow. Results A significant reduction in the physician's expenditure of time for the decision-making process by -59.9\% (p {$<$} 0,001) was found using the software. System usage showed a high positive effect on evaluated information quality parameters completeness (Cohen's d of 2.36), format (6.15), understandability (2.64), as well as user satisfaction (4.94). Conclusion The software demonstrated that comprehensive organization of information improves physician's effectiveness and satisfaction in the clinical decision-making process. Further development is needed to map more complex patient pathways, such as the follow-up treatment of prostate cancer.Copyright © 2022 Henkel et al.

  abstract = {Objectives: The practical use of patient reported outcomes (PRO) in clinical decision support is not yet established. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of implementing a state-of-the-art IT-system; ERVIN, that combines artificial intelligence in real-time electronic PRO (ePRO) to support shared decision making. Denmark has a long tradition of data collection in health care and a personal identification number is used in all registrations in health care, which enables linkage of all data collected. The challenge today is that the knowledge embedded in patient-specific health-care data is not utilized to its full potential, neither within nor between the primary and the secondary sectors. ERVIN is designed as a clinical decision support system for surgical treatment of knee and hip replacement. In practice, the patient answers a set of validated ePRO questionnaires before the surgical consultations to provide information about the patients' individual health status. ERVIN collects the ePRO data and combines them with data merged from other data systems. The merged dataset is applied in real-time predictive analyses of expected risks and outcomes of hip/knee replacement at a patient-specific level. The result is a graphical visualization of the real-time ePRO data and prediction scores, which is used to assist the patient and the surgeon during the consultation. Method(s): Answering rates of 100\% completed PRO questionnaires are estimated, and a cut-off value for an acceptable improvement in function is set to a minimum of 14\% on a normalized scale between baseline, and at one year follow-up. Result(s): The completion rates at baseline, 6- and 12 months post implementation for hip- and knee patients are; 43\%, 40\%, 71\% 73\%, and 77\%, 95\%, respectively. Furthermore, 90\% of the patients had an acceptable clinical improvement post surgery. Conclusion(s): The study showed that using PRO data to support clinical decision-making is both feasible and safe.Copyright © 2019},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning-based clinical decision support systems (ML\_CDSS) are increasingly employed in various sectors of health care aiming at supporting clinicians' practice by matching the characteristics of individual patients with a computerised clinical knowledge base. Some studies even indicate that ML\_CDSS may surpass physicians' competencies regarding specific isolated tasks. From an ethical perspective, however, the usage of ML\_CDSS in medical practice touches on a range of fundamental normative issues. This article aims to add to the ethical discussion by using professionalisation theory as an analytical lens for investigating how medical action at the micro level and the physician-patient relationship might be affected by the employment of ML\_CDSS., MAIN TEXT: Professionalisation theory, as a distinct sociological framework, provides an elaborated account of what constitutes client-related professional action, such as medical action, at its core and why it is more than pure expertise-based action. Professionalisation theory is introduced by presenting five general structural features of professionalised medical practice: (i) the patient has a concern; (ii) the physician deals with the patient's concern; (iii) s/he gives assistance without patronising; (iv) s/he regards the patient in a holistic manner without building up a private relationship; and (v) s/he applies her/his general expertise to the particularities of the individual case. Each of these five key aspects are then analysed regarding the usage of ML\_CDSS, thereby integrating the perspectives of professionalisation theory and medical ethics., CONCLUSIONS: Using ML\_CDSS in medical practice requires the physician to pay special attention to those facts of the individual case that cannot be comprehensively considered by ML\_CDSS, for example, the patient's personality, life situation or cultural background. Moreover, the more routinized the use of ML\_CDSS becomes in clinical practice, the more that physicians need to focus on the patient's concern and strengthen patient autonomy, for instance, by adequately integrating digital decision support in shared decision-making.

  abstract = {Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to address the complexity of clinical decision making and possibly limit the bias inherent in individual decision making. Poor outcomes for patients with low back pain are common and it continues to be burdensome condition for both patients and the NHS. There is a resultant imperative to ensure patients receive the right treatment at the right time. A decision support tool for LBP developed with a Delphi approach has been implemented with some success in the past, but could results be improved with AI techniques? This study proposes and pilots a method for building an AI clinical reasoning model using expert judgements from MSK practitioners. Method(s): Three sequential elicitation stages to determine: Variables, Structure, and Probabilities; were conducted using a bespoke online tool, developed for the project. In each stage, participants were asked to consider a patient scenario and reason which factors they would consider when assessing the patient (variables), what the relationships were between these factors (structure) and the probability of outcome (probabilities). Variables and structure were elicited in an initial online phase followed by a workshop to achieve consensus, each using the bespoke tool. A modified Delphi procedure was used. The metrics for agreement used were median scores and an inter-percentile range of 0.7. The third stage was conducted online only using the bespoke tool. Result(s): Variables: Consensus was achieved on the categorisation of Signs and Symptoms, but not of other variables in the model. Masquerading conditions and biomedical causes of back pain were ranked above psychological and social causes for inclusion in the final model. Structure: Relationships between S\&S and diagnostic categories was largely uncontentious. Associations between Risk Factors and diagnostic categories was more challenging. Despite this, an overall representation of the clinical reasoning process was developed using this procedure. Population of the model with probabilities is underway to complete the model. Conclusion(s): Lessons learned: Reviewing the recorded discussions for the detailed reasoning processes and qualitative information is invaluable to the model development; quantitative data on consensus was less useful without the clinical context. Developing a complex model of clinical reasoning is possible and its utility has been proven with biomedical diagnoses. This method should be more deeply tested on the psychological and social components of LBP, potentially with scenario based reasoning to focus the questions asked. Impact: The development and implementation of this tool has important ramifications for inexperienced or non-specialist staff directing patients to optimal pathways, and additional implications for streamlining the patient experience of a complex health pathway.

A six-stage scoping review of 10 literature databases focused on keywords in four concept areas: (1) mobile technologies; (2) sensors, wearables, and remote monitoring; (3) mood and anxiety disorders, as well as stress; and (4) behavioral health care. Two authors independently screened results based on titles and abstracts, reviewed the full-text articles, and used inclusion/exclusion criteria to find research that studied self-report or management of symptoms and interventions. Out of a total of 5468 potential references, 76 papers were selected and an additional 16 studies were discovered in references. Of the 92 studies, 54 (58.7\%) focused on mood (depressive, N\,=\,28; bipolar, N\,=\,26), 18 (19.6\%) on anxiety disorders, and 20 (21.7\%) on psychological stress/stress disorders. There were 7 (7.6\%) randomized controlled trials, and 31 (33.7\%) comparison studies. Research is shifting toward standardized methods, interventions, and evaluation measures, with longitudinal correlation, prediction, and/or biomarking/digital phenotyping of patients’ outcomes. These technologies pose several challenges for users, clinicians (e.g., selection, training, skills), healthcare systems (e.g., technology, integration into workflow, privacy), and organizations (e.g., training, creating a professional e-culture, change). Future research is needed on clinical health outcomes; human–computer interaction; medico-legal, professional, and privacy policy issues; models of service delivery; and effectiveness at a population level, across cultures, and related to economic costs.

Emergency departments (EDs) are tasked with distinguishing patients who require hospital resources from those who may be safely discharged to the community. The novelty and high variability of COVID-19 have made these determinations challenging. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated an electronic health record (EHR) embedded clinical decision support (CDS) system that leverages machine learning (ML) to estimate short-term risk for clinical deterioration in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. The system translates model-generated risk for critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h into rapidly interpretable COVID-19 Deterioration Risk Levels made viewable within ED clinician workflow. ML models were derived in a retrospective cohort of 21,452 ED patients who visited one of five ED study sites and were prospectively validated in 15,670 ED visits that occurred before (n = 4322) or after (n = 11,348) CDS implementation; model performance and numerous patient-oriented outcomes including in-hospital mortality were measured across study periods. Incidence of critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h were 10.7\% and 22.5\%, respectively and were similar across study periods. ML model performance was excellent under all conditions, with AUC ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for prediction of critical care needs and 0.80-0.90 for inpatient care needs. Total mortality was unchanged across study periods but was reduced among high-risk patients after CDS implementation.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

We discuss the applicability of CORE-MI to clinical practice and explore user perceptions of surveillance, workplace misuse, and notions of objectivity, and system reliability that may apply to automated evaluation systems generally.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The study sought to assess the clinical performance of a machine learning model aiming to identify unusual medication orders. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was conducted at CHU Sainte-Justine, Canada, from April to August 2020. An unsupervised machine learning model based on GANomaly and 2 baselines were trained to learn medication order patterns from 10 years of data. Clinical pharmacists dichotomously (typical or atypical) labeled orders and pharmacological profiles (patients' medication lists). Confusion matrices, areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRs), and F1 scores were calculated. Result(s): A total of 12 471 medication orders and 1356 profiles were labeled by 25 pharmacists. Medication order predictions showed a precision of 35\%, recall (sensitivity) of 26\%, and specificity of 97\% as compared with pharmacist labels, with an AUPR of 0.25 and an F1 score of 0.30. Profile predictions showed a precision of 49\%, recall of 75\%, and specificity of 82\%, with an AUPR of 0.60, and an F1 score of 0.59. The model performed better than the baselines. According to the pharmacists, the model was a useful screening tool, and 9 of 15 participants preferred predictions by medication, rather than by profile. Discussion(s): Predictions for profiles had higher F1 scores and recall compared with medication order predictions. Although the performance was much better for profile predictions, pharmacists generally preferred medication order predictions. Conclusion(s): Based on the AUPR, this model showed better performance for the identification of atypical pharmacological profiles than for medication orders. Pharmacists considered the model a useful screening tool. Improving these predictions should be prioritized in future research to maximize clinical impact.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Objective To predict hospital admission at the time of ED triage using patient history in addition to information collected at triage. Methods This retrospective study included all adult ED visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80\%), validation (10\%), and test (10\%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model. Results A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7\%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95\% Cl 0.860.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% Cl 0.87-0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% Cl 0.87-0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95\% Cl 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% Cl 0.87-0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% Cl 0.87-0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95\% Cl 0.91-0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95\% Cl 0.92-0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95\% Cl 0.92-0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50\% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95\% Cl 0.91-0.91). Conclusion Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To predict 72-h and 9-day emergency department (ED) return by using gradient boosting on an expansive set of clinical variables from the electronic health record. Method(s): This retrospective study included all adult discharges from a level 1 trauma center ED and a community hospital ED covering the period of March 2013 to July 2017. A total of 1500 variables were extracted for each visit, and samples split randomly into training, validation, and test sets (80\%, 10\%, and 10\%). Gradient boosting models were fit on 3 selections of the data: administrative data (demographics, prior hospital usage, and comorbidity categories), data available at triage, and the full set of data available at discharge. A logistic regression (LR) model built on administrative data was used for baseline comparison. Finally, the top 20 most informative variables identified from the full gradient boosting models were used to build a reduced model for each outcome. Result(s): A total of 330 631 discharges were available for analysis, with 29 058 discharges (8.8\%) resulting in 72- h return and 52 748 discharges (16.0\%) resulting in 9-day return to either ED. LR models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.70) and 0.71(95\% CI 0.70-0.72), while gradient boosting models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95\% CI 0.72-0.74) and 0.74 (95\% CI 0.73-0.74) for 72-h and 9-day return, respectively. Gradient boosting models using variables available at triage yielded test AUCs of 0.75 (95\% CI 0.74-0.76) and 0.75 (95\% CI 0.74-0.75), while those using the full set of variables yielded test AUCs of 0.76 (95\% CI 0.75-0.77) and 0.75 (95\% CI 0.75-0.76). Reduced models using the top 20 variables yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71-0.74) and 0.73 (95\% CI 0.72-0.74). Discussion and Conclusion(s): Gradient boosting models leveraging clinical data are superior to LR models built on administrative data at predicting 72-h and 9-day returns.

  abstract = {Objective: Machine learning techniques can be used to extract predictive models for diseases from electronic medical records (EMRs). However, the nature of EMRs makes it difficult to apply off-the-shelf machine learning techniques while still exploiting the rich content of the EMRs. In this paper, we explore the usage of a range of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable predictors from uncoded consultation notes and study whether they can help to improve predictive performance. Methods: We study a number of existing techniques for the extraction of predictors from the consultation notes, namely a bag of words based approach and topic modeling. In addition, we develop a dedicated technique to match the uncoded consultation notes with a medical ontology. We apply these techniques as an extension to an existing pipeline to extract predictors from EMRs. We evaluate them in the context of predictive modeling for colorectal cancer (CRC), a disease known to be difficult to diagnose before performing an endoscopy. Results: Our results show that we are able to extract useful information from the consultation notes. The predictive performance of the ontology-based extraction method moves significantly beyond the benchmark of age and gender alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.870 versus 0.831). We also observe more accurate predictive models by adding features derived from processing the consultation notes compared to solely using coded data (AUC of 0.896 versus 0.882) although the difference is not significant. The extracted features from the notes are shown be equally predictive (i.e. there is no significant difference in performance) compared to the coded data of the consultations. Conclusion: It is possible to extract useful predictors from uncoded consultation notes that improve predictive performance. Techniques linking text to concepts in medical ontologies to derive these predictors are shown to perform best for predicting CRC in our EMR dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using information from the writings of a patient can potentially be a valuable source of information, especially now that more and more treatments involve computer-based exercises or electronic conversations between patient and therapist. In this paper, we study predictive modeling using writings of patients under treatment for a social anxiety disorder. We extract a wealth of information from the text written by patients including their usage of words, the topics they talk about, the sentiment of the messages, and the style of writing. In addition, we study trends over time with respect to those measures. We then apply machine learning algorithms to generate the predictive models. Based on a dataset of 69 patients, we are able to show that we can predict therapy outcome with an area under the curve of 0.83 halfway through the therapy and with a precision of 0.78 when using the full data (i.e., the entire treatment period). Due to the limited number of participants, it is hard to generalize the results, but they do show great potential in this type of information.},

  abstract = {Visual analytics are becoming increasingly important in the light of big data and related scenarios. Along this trend, the field of immersive analytics has been variously furthered as it is able to provide sophisticated visual data analytics on one hand, while preserving user-friendliness on the other. Furthermore, recent hardware developments such as smart glasses, as well as achievements in virtual-reality applications, have fanned immersive analytic solutions. Notably, such solutions can be very effective when they are applied to high-dimensional datasets. Taking this advantage into account, the work at hand applies immersive analytics to a high-dimensional production dataset to improve the digital support of daily work tasks. More specifically, a mixed-reality implementation is presented that will support manufacturers as well as data scientists to comprehensively analyze machine data. As a particular goal, the prototype will simplify the analysis of manufacturing data through the usage of dimensionality reduction effects. Therefore, five aspects are mainly reported in this paper. First, it is shown how dimensionality reduction effects can be represented by clusters. Second, it is presented how the resulting information loss of the reduction is addressed. Third, the graphical interface of the developed prototype is illustrated as it provides (1) a correlation coefficient graph, (2) a plot for the information loss, and (3) a 3D particle system. In addition, an implemented voice recognition feature of the prototype is shown, which was considered to be being promising to select or deselect data variables users are interested in when analyzing the data. Fourth, based on a machine learning library, it is shown how the prototype reduces computational resources using smart glasses. The main idea is based on a recommendation approach as well as the use of subspace clustering. Fifth, results from a practical setting are presented, in which the prototype was shown to domain experts. The latter reported that such a tool is actually helpful to analyze machine data daily. Moreover, it was reported that such a system can be used to educate machine operators more properly. As a general outcome of this work, the presented approach may constitute a helpful solution for the industry as well as other domains such as medicine.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide is a global public health concern, but it is preventable. Increased contact with primary care before the suicide or attempted suicide raises opportunities for intervention and prevention. However, suicide assessment and management are areas that many general practitioners (GPs) find particularly challenging. Previous research has indicated significant variability in how GPs understand, operationalize, and assess suicide risk, which subsequently has an impact on clinical decision making. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been widely implemented across different health care settings, including primary care to support practitioners in clinical decision making. A CDSS may reduce inconsistencies in the identification, assessment, and management of suicide risk by GPs by guiding them through the consultation and generating a risk assessment plan that can be shared with a service user or with specialized mental health services. Objective: Our aim is to co-develop and test with end users (eg, GPs, primary care attendees, mental health professionals) an electronic clinical decision support system (e-CDSS) to support GPs in the identification, assessment, and management of suicidality in primary care. Methods: Ours is an ongoing embedded mixed-methods study with four phases: (1) qualitative interviews with GPs to explore their views on the content, format, and use of the e-CDSS, as well as consultation with two service-user advisory groups (people aged ≤25 and people aged ≥25) to inform the content of the e-CDSS including phrasing of items and clarity; (2) participatory co-production workshops with GPs, service users, and clinical experts in suicidality to determine the content and format of the e-CDDS; gain consensus of the relevance of items; establish content validity and identify pathways to implementation, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; (3) building the e-CDSS so that it guides the GP through a consultation; and (4) usability testing of the e-CDSS with GPs and service users in one primary care practice involving a nonlive and a live stage. Results: The study was funded for four years, to take place between 2015 and 2019, and is currently completing phase 4 data collection. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2019. The findings will enable us to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a suicide-specific, electronic, guided decision support system in primary care. Conclusions: This study will be the first to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of an electronic, guided decision support system for use in primary care consultations for the improved assessment and management of suicidality.

  abstract = {Background: Inpatient critical deterioration is a severe worsening of a hospitalized child's condition that warrants initiation of life support systems to prevent death. Many episodes of critical deterioration are preventable, yet objective indicators of impending deterioration are often unrecognized or underappreciated. Structured data continuously captured in the electronic health record (EHR), such as laboratory values, vital signs and nursing assessments, can be used to ascertain the severity of a patient's condition. Recognizing that clinicians are only able to synthesize EHR information streams episodically, we aimed to augment our institution's existing surveillance systems by creating an acuity index to provide a continuous, probabilistic assessment of the likelihood of critical deterioration among inpatient children. Method(s): Conceptualization of the acuity index adhered to the Littenberg framework for development of clinical decision support tools, which considers the clinical and technical plausibility of the tool, as well as process outcomes, patient outcomes and eventual societal outcomes addressed by the tool. For model construction, critical deterioration was defined as a composite outcome of medical emergency response team activation, death, transfer to an intensive care unit with receipt of either positive pressure ventilation or vasoactive medication support within the following 12 hours, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initiation of extracorporeal life support or a significant transfusion event in which a patient received packed red blood cells and 2 transfusions of either cryofibrinogen, platelets or fresh frozen plasma within 6 hours of one another. Candidate predictors were identified through group discussion and EHR data were extracted for all inpatient encounters with {$>$}24 hrs length of stay during calendar year 2017. Predictors included vital signs, laboratory data, nursing assessments and medication administration. Vital signs were transformed to age-adjusted z scores. Data within 6 hrs prior to deterioration were excluded. The cohort was divided into development and validation sets, with feature selection and model development proceeding using several, iterative, machine-learning-based approaches. Model discrimination was assessed by evaluating c-statistics and areas under the precision recall curves. For implementation, a server hosting R statistical software was synced with a clinical data warehouse. Result(s): There were 7,097 encounters and 134 (2.7\%) critical deterioration events in the development cohort and 4729 encounters with 88 (1.9\%) events in the validation cohort. Fifty-three candidate features were considered for inclusion in the models. Table 1 displays characteristics of the predictive models. Figure 1 displays receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves for all models. Conclusion(s): The Random Forest model with Boruta feature selection demonstrated the best discrimination and is being implemented on a R server synced to a real-time stream of EHR data. Prospective assessment of model performance once available to front-line clinicians will be necessary to determine the impact of the index for preventing episodes of critical deterioration.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have demonstrated great potential in improving the diagnostic accuracy of retinal disease but are yet to achieve widespread acceptance in routine clinical practice. Clinician attitudes are known to influence implementation. Therefore, this study aimed to identify optometrists' attitudes towards the use of AI to assist in diagnosing retinal disease. METHOD(S): A paper-based survey was designed to assess general attitudes towards AI in diagnosing retinal disease and motivators/barriers for future use. Two clinical scenarios for using AI were evaluated: (1) at the point of care to obtain a diagnostic recommendation, versus (2) after the consultation to provide a second opinion. Relationships between participant characteristics and attitudes towards AI were explored. The survey was mailed to 252 randomly selected practising optometrists across Australia, with repeat mail-outs to non-respondents. RESULT(S): The response rate was 53\% (133/252). Respondents' mean (SD) age was 42.7 (13.3) years, and 44.4\% (59/133) identified as female, whilst 1.5\% (2/133) identified as gender diverse. The mean number of years practising in primary eye care was 18.8 (13.2) years with 64.7\% (86/133) working in an independently owned practice. On average, responding optometrists reported positive attitudes (mean score 4.0 out of 5, SD 0.8) towards using AI as a tool to aid the diagnosis of retinal disease, and would be more likely to use AI if it is proven to increase patient access to healthcare (mean score 4.4 out of 5, SD 0.6). Furthermore, optometrists expressed a statistically significant preference for using AI after the consultation to provide a second opinion rather than during the consultation, at the point-of-care (+0.12, p =0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Optometrists have positive attitudes towards the future use of AI as an aid to diagnose retinal disease. Understanding clinician attitudes and preferences for using AI may help maximise its clinical potential and ensure its successful translation into practice.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract = {Introduction: The length of stay of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is an indication of patient ICU resource usage and varies considerably. Planning of postoperative ICU admissions is important as ICUs often have no nonoccupied beds available. Problem statement: Estimation of the ICU bed availability for the next coming days is entirely based on clinical judgement by intensivists and therefore too inaccurate. For this reason, predictive models have much potential for improving planning for ICU patient admission. Objective: Our goal is to develop and optimize models for patient survival and ICU length of stay (LOS) based on monitored ICU patient data. Furthermore, these models are compared on their use of sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores as well as underlying raw data as input features. Methodology: Different machine learning techniques are trained, using a 14,480 patient dataset, both on SOFA scores as well as their underlying raw data values from the first five days after admission, in order to predict (i) the patient LOS, and (ii) the patient mortality. Furthermore, to help physicians in assessing the prediction credibility, a probabilistic model is tailored to the output of our best-performing model, assigning a belief to each patient status prediction. A two-by-two grid is built, using the classification outputs of the mortality and prolonged stay predictors to improve the patient LOS regression models. Results: For predicting patient mortality and a prolonged stay, the best performing model is a support vector machine (SVM) with G(A,D) = 65.9\% (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77) and G(S,L) = 73.2\% (AUC of 0.82). In terms of LOS regression, the best performing model is support vector regression, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.79 days and a median absolute error of 1.22 days for those patients surviving a nonprolonged stay. Conclusion: Using a classification grid based on the predicted patient mortality and prolonged stay, allows more accurate modeling of the patient LOS. The detailed models allow to support the decisions made by physicians in an ICU setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Various forms of electronic health records (EHRs) are currently being introduced in several countries. Nurses are primary stakeholders and need to ensure that their information and knowledge needs are being met by such systems information sharing between health care providers to enable them to improve the quality and efficiency of health care service delivery for all subjects of care. The latest international EHR standards have adopted the openEHR approach of two-level modelling. The first level is a stable information model determining structure, while the second level consists of constraint models or 'archetypes' that reflect the specifications or clinician rules for how clinical information needs to be represented to enable unambiguous data sharing. The current state of play in terms of international health informatics standards development activities is providing the nursing profession with a unique opportunity and challenge. Much work has been undertaken internationally in the area of nursing terminologies and evidence-based practice. This paper argues that to make the most of these emerging technologies and EHRs we must now concentrate on developing a process to identify, document, implement, manage and govern our nursing domain knowledge as well as contribute to the development of relevant international standards. It is argued that one comprehensive nursing terminology, such as the ICNP or SNOMED CT is simply too complex and too difficult to maintain. As the openEHR archetype approach does not rely heavily on big standardised terminologies, it offers more flexibility during standardisation of clinical concepts and it ensures open, future-proof electronic health records. We conclude that it is highly desirable for the nursing profession to adopt this openEHR approach as a means of documenting and governing the nursing profession's domain knowledge. It is essential for the nursing profession to develop its domain knowledge constraint models (archetypes) collaboratively in an international context.},

It was first vetted at an informatics retreat held in 1989 at Columbia University's Arden Homestead. The syntax was intended to be readable by clinician experts but to provide powerful array processing, which was derived largely a programming language called APL. The syntax was improved and implemented by a number of researchers and vendors in the early 1990's and was initially adopted by the consensus standards organization, the American Society for Testing and Materials.

  abstract = {Simple Summary We report a local control prediction model for patients undergoing MRgFUS ablation, and provide promising guidance for clinicians to identify a suitable treatment strategy for bone metastatic lesions. We propose a few-shot learning approach to establish the quick prediction of clinical and radiographic responses. On the basis of demographic data, pre-/post-treatment immune-related cytokine change, and MRI imaging, the most suitable parameters were selected to assess potential treatment outcomes during the acute inflammatory stages within 24 h. Traditional logistic regression and few-shot learning models were compared to identify the best model on an independent test. The best predictive few-shot learning model (accuracy of 85.2\%, sensitivity of 88.6\%, and AUC of 0.95) was achieved by combining the clinical features with the levels of significant cytokines IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) constitutes a noninvasive treatment strategy to ablate deep-seated bone metastases. However, limited evidence suggests that, although cytokines are influenced by thermal necrosis, there is still no cytokine threshold for clinical responses. A prediction model to approximate the postablation immune status on the basis of circulating cytokine activation is thus needed. IL-6 and IP-10, which are proinflammatory cytokines, decreased significantly during the acute phase. Wound-healing cytokines such as VEGF and PDGF increased after ablation, but the increase was not statistically significant. In this phase, IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin expression levels diminished the ongoing inflammatory progression in the treated sites. These cytokine changes also correlated with the response rate of primary tumor control after acute periods. The few-shot learning algorithm was applied to test the correlation between cytokine levels and local control (p = 0.036). The best-fitted model included IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin as cytokine parameters from the few-shot selection, and had an accuracy of 85.2\%, sensitivity of 88.6\%, and AUC of 0.95. The acceptable usage of this model may help predict the acute-phase prognosis of a patient with painful bone metastasis who underwent local MRgFUS. The application of machine learning in bone metastasis is equivalent or better than the current logistic regression.},

We included wide-ranging information on 43 potential covariates across four domains, demographic and socio-economic status, behavior, health status and healthcare utilization. We exploited a principled nonparametric permutation based approach using Bayesian machine learning to identify and rank important determinants of discussions about smoking between health providers and patients. In the order of importance, frequency of doctor office visits, intensity of cigarette use, length of smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, marital status were major determinants of disparities in provider-patient discussions about smoking. There was a distinct interaction between intensity of cigarette use and length of smoking history. Our analysis may provide some insights into strategies for promoting discussions on smoking and facilitating smoking cessation. Health care resource usage, smoking intensity and duration and smoking-related conditions were key drivers. The "usual suspects", age, gender, race and ethnicity were less important, and gender, in particular, had little effect.},

Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users' continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research.

Voice-based diagnostic methods are convenient, non-invasive to elicit, and can be collected and processed in near real-time using modern smartphones, smart speakers, and other devices. Studies in voice-based depression detection to date have primarily focused on laboratory-collected voice samples, which are not representative of typical user environments or devices. This paper conducts the first investigation of voice-based depression assessment techniques on real-world data from 887 speakers, recorded using a variety of different smartphones. Evaluations on 16 hours of speech show that conservative segment selection strategies using highly thresholded voice activity detection, coupled with tailored normalization approaches are effective for mitigating smartphone channel variability and background environmental noise. Together, these strategies can achieve F1 scores comparable with or better than those from a combination of clean recordings, a single recording environment and long utterances. The scalability of speech elicitation via smartphone allows detailed models dependent on gender, smartphone manufacturer and/or elicitation task. Interestingly, results herein suggest that normalization based on these criteria may be more effective than tailored models for detecting depressed speech.}

Augmented hearing protection technology that uses advanced artificial intelligenc-based signal processing to amplify safety-critical sounds offers great potential to address the issue. To facilitate the acceptance of this new technology, it is critical to understand the user's intention of use of augmented HPDs. The current state-of-the-art, however, offers little understanding about the user's intention of use of such new technology. This paper fills the gap by exploring factors that determine the user's intention of use of augmented HPDs in the construction environment. Data were collected using questionnaires from 298 practitioners in the US, China, and Japan. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was adopted for analyzing the collected data. The results denote that the intention of use of augmented hearing protection technology is determined by the user's perceived usefulness of which the perceived ease of use, hearing health, and safety consciousness, trust on autonomy are among the most critical factors. The findings of this study enrich understandings of the theories of technology adoption in construction. It presents a further step towards critical design and implementation considerations for the success of augmented hearing protection technology in the future.},

  abstract = {Background: Research into interventions based on mobile health (m-Health) applications (apps) has attracted considerable attention among researchers; however, most previous studies have focused on research-led apps and their effectiveness when applied to overweight/obese adults. There remains a paucity of research on the attitudes of typical consumers toward the adoption of m-Health apps for weight management. This study adopted the tenets of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) as the theoretical foundation in developing a model that integrates personal innovativeness (PI) and network externality (NE) in seeking to identify the factors with the most pronounced effect on one's intention to use an artificial intelligence-powered weight loss and health management app. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted for Taiwanese participants aged {$>$}= 21 years from May 23 to June 30, 2018. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Results: In the analysis of 458 responses, the proposed research model explained 75.5\% of variance in behavioral intention (BI). Habit was the independent variable with the strongest performance in predicting user intention, followed by PI, NE, and performance expectancy (PE). Social influence weakly affects user intention through PE. In multi-group analysis, education was shown to exert a moderating influence on some of the relationships hypothesized in the model. Conclusions: The empirically validated model in this study provides insights into the primary determinants of user intention toward the adoption of m-Health app for weight loss and health management. The theoretical and practical implications are relevant to researchers seeking to extend the applicability of the UTAUT2 model to health apps as well as practitioners seeking to promote the adoption of m-Health apps. In the future, researchers could extend the model to assess the effects of BI on actual use behavior.},

Conversely, the economic burden imposed by wearable medical devices and services was likely to reduce intention to adopt. Therefore, the payment mechanism warrants cautious evaluation.},

Multivariate synchrony goes beyond the bivariate case and can be useful for quantifying how groups, teams, and families coordinate their behaviors, or estimating the degree to which multiple modalities from an individual become synchronized. Our package includes state-of-the-art multivariate methods including symbolic entropy, multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis, coherence (with an additional sum-normalized modification), the cluster-phase 'Rho' metric, and a statistical test based on the Kuramoto order parameter. We also include functions for two surrogation techniques to compare the observed coordination dynamics with chance levels and a windowing function to examine time-varying coordination for most of the measures. Taken together, our collation and presentation of these methods make the study of interpersonal synchronization and coordination dynamics applicable to larger, more complex and often more ecologically valid study designs. In this work, we summarize the relevant theoretical background and present illustrative practical examples, lessons learned, as well as guidance for the usage of our package - using synthetic as well as empirical data. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of our work and software and outline interesting further directions and perspectives. multiSyncPy is freely available under the LGPL license at: https://github.com/cslab-hub/multiSyncPy, and also available at the Python package index.},

  abstract = {Introduction Pre-emptive testing of pharmacogenetically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be an effective tool in the prevention of adverse drug reactions and therapy resistance. However, most of the tests are not used as standard in routine care in Germany because of lacking evidence for the clinical and economical benefit and their impact on the usage of healthcare services. We address this issue by investigating the influence of pharmacogenetic profiles on the use of healthcare services over an extended period of several years using routine care data from a statutory health insurance company. The goal is to provide clinical evidence whether pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing of metabolic profiles in routine care in Germany is beneficial and cost-effective. Methods and analysis The EMPAR (Einfluss metabolischer Profile auf die Arzneimitteltherapiesicherheit in der Routineversorgung) study is a non-interventional cohort study conducted to analyse pharmacogenetic risk factors that are important for drug therapy by means of endpoints relevant for healthcare. The analysis is based on pharmacogenetic profiles and statutory health insurance data. We perform pharmacogenetic, pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacoeconomic analyses using health care utilisation scores and machine learning techniques. Therefore, we aim to include about 10 000 patients ({$>$}= 18 years) insured by the health insurance provider Techniker Krankenkasse. The study focuses on patients with prescriptions of anticoagulants and prescriptions of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Also, a screening for special pharmacogenetic characteristics will be performed in patients with at least one Y57.9! diagnosis (Complication of medical and surgical care: drug or medicament, unspecified). Outcomes include the utilisation of health insurance services, the incidence of incapacity for work and costs for drugs and treatment. Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Bonn (Lfd. Nr. 339/17). The results of this research project will be published in scientific open access journals and at conferences.},

We investigated knowledge and attitude towards AI by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond.                                            Methods                Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards AI was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards AI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.                                            Results                                  The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male (                  n                  = 670, 65\%), median age was 38 (24–74) years,                  n                  = 142 (35\%) residents, and                  n                  = 471 (45\%) worked in an academic center. Basic AI-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.10–2.21,                  p                  = 0.01), while intermediate AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.20–0.80,                  p                  = 0.01) or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.21–0.90,                  p                  = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards AI was observed in 48\% (                  n                  = 501) and was associated with only having heard of AI, intermediate (adjusted OR 11.65, 95\% CI 4.25–31.92,                  p                  {$<$} 0.001), or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 17.65, 95\% CI 6.16–50.54,                  p                  {$<$} 0.001).                                                            Conclusions                Limited AI-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced AI-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards AI. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption.                                            Key Points                                  • Forty-eight percent of radiologists and residents have an open and proactive attitude towards artificial intelligence (AI), while 38\% fear of replacement by AI.                                                  • Intermediate and advanced AI-specific knowledge levels may enhance adoption of AI in clinical practice, while rudimentary knowledge levels appear to be inhibitive.                                                  • AI should be incorporated in radiology training curricula to help facilitate its clinical adoption.},

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs.                                            Methods                Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.                                            Results                                  The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (                  n                  = 855, 82\%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (                  n                  = 829, 78\%) and work-flow optimization (                  n                  = 802, 77\%). Ethical and legal issues (                  n                  = 630, 62\%) and lack of knowledge (                  n                  = 584, 57\%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (                  n                  = 819, 79\%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (                  n                  = 241, 23\%).                                                            Conclusions                Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation.                                            Key Points                                  • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty                  .                                                  • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles                  .                                                  • Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology                  .},

COVID-19 brings a lot of challenges to government globally. Among the different strategies the most extensively adopted ones were lockdown, social distancing, and isolation among others. Most people with no mental illness history have been found with high risk of distress and psychological discomfort due to anxiety of being infected with the virus. Panic among people due to COVID-19 spread faster than the disease itself. The misinformation and excessive usage of social media in this pandemic era have adversely affected mental health across the world. Due to limited historical data, psychiatrists are finding it difficult to cure the mental illness of people resulting from the pandemic repercussion, fueled by social media forum. In this study the methodology used for data extraction is by considering the implications of social network platforms (such as Reddit) and levering the capabilities of a semi-supervised co-training technique-based use of Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The experimental results shows the efficacy of the proposed methodology to identify the mental illness level (such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, schizophrenia, and OCD) of those who are in anxious of being infected with this virus. We observed 1 to 5\% improvement in the classification decision through the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art classifiers.},

The speed with which a healthcare provider receives pertinent information, such as results from clinical orders, can impact flow. We seek to determine if clinical ordering behavior can be predicted at triage during an ED visit., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data available during triage, we trained multilabel machine learning classifiers to predict clinical orders placed during an ED visit. We benchmarked 4 classifiers with 2 multilabel learning frameworks that predict orders independently (binary relevance) or simultaneously (random k-labelsets). We evaluated algorithm performance, calculated variable importance, and conducted a simple simulation study to examine the effects of algorithm implementation on length of stay and cost., RESULTS: Aggregate performance across orders was highest when predicting orders independently with a multilayer perceptron (median F1 score = 0.56), but prediction frameworks that simultaneously predict orders for a visit enhanced predictive performance for correlated orders. Visit acuity was the most important predictor for most orders. Simulation results indicated that direct implementation of the model would increase ordering costs (from \$21 to \$45 per visit) but reduce length of stay (from 158 minutes to 151 minutes) over all visits., DISCUSSION: Simulated implementations of the predictive algorithm decreased length of stay but increased ordering costs. Optimal implementation of these predictions to reduce patient length of stay without incurring additional costs requires more exploration., CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to predict common clinical orders placed during an ED visit with data available at triage.

  abstract = {In information security context, social engineering is defined as malicious activities caused by cybercriminals by means of human interactions. It is mainly a psychological manipulation technique which gets benefit of human error to reach private information. This study used machine learning algorithms to predict individuals' susceptibility to be tricked by social engineering attacks. Simulated scenarios were presented to study participants, and they were asked to identify whether each scenario was a social engineering attack or not. Different kinds of attacks related to various industries were integrated to social engineering simulations. For each participant, different types of social engineering scores were calculated according to their responses. Besides simulations, questionnaires related to demographics, technology usage, and personality traits were filled out by the participants. All of these collected data were used in building predictive classification and regression machine learning models. Through regression and classification models, it was aimed to proactively predict individuals' social engineering risk levels and classify them into different risk groups in terms of different attack types. This research revealed that it is possible to predetermine the social engineering risk levels of individuals. This important finding means that possible attacks can be prevented by raising awareness before the attack occurs. Within the scope of this study, a social engineering risk detection mobile application has also been developed to give practitioners and policy makers an idea of what kind of systems can be developed in order to determine the risk levels of individuals and then to educate them about various attacks. The ones who need to take action against social engineering attacks will get benefit from findings of this research.},

Though existing automated systems aid the telehealth practitioner, however high computing effort, time, and cost is required in terms of several classifiers, multi class problem, or large sample size to obtained results on the basis of ground reality. Goal: We work on this concern and propose a methodology which is employed via "Learning to Rank" (i.e., a supervised learner) to rank the patients on the basis of their data relevancy. We also propose a model to investigate the efficacy of the proposed method. We assess tie efficacy of the proposed method with seven public datasets associated with certain diseases. Datasets are retrieved from UCI repository Machine Learning Repository. Results: We observed LambdaMART outperform than AdaRank and Coordinate Ascent with a minor difference in terms of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) and MAP (Mean Average Precision) to predict patients prone to chronic diseases. Conclusion: The results of study indicates the usage of the proposed method as a recommendation system to rank the patients on the basis of their severity level.},

They involve affective and cognitive components, both of which need to be closely monitored over the course of the illness. Current methods like interviews and rating scales can be cumbersome, sometimes ineffective, and oftentimes infrequently administered. Even ecological momentary assessments, when used alone, are susceptible to many of the same limitations and still require active participation from the subject. Passive, continuous, frictionless, and ubiquitous means of recording and analyzing mood and cognition obviate the need for more frequent and lengthier doctor's visits, can help identify misdiagnoses, and would potentially serve as an early warning system to better manage medication adherence and prevent hospitalizations. Activity trackers and smartwatches have long provided exactly such a tool for evaluating physical fitness. What if smartphones, voice assistants, and eventually Internet of Things devices and ambient computing systems could similarly serve as fitness trackers for the brain, without imposing any additional burden on the user? In this chapter, we explore two such early approaches-an in-depth analytical technique based on examining meta-features of virtual keyboard usage and corresponding typing kinematics, and another method which analyzes the acoustic features of recorded speech-to passively and unobtrusively understand mood and cognition in people with bipolar disorder. We review innovative studies that have used these methods to build mathematical models and machine learning frameworks that can provide deep insights into users' mood and cognitive states. We then outline future research considerations and close by discussing the opportunities and challenges afforded by these modes of researching mood disorders and passive sensing approaches in general.},

Acne is one of the most common skin conditions with profound effects in severe cases. In this study, we developed an AI system called AcneDet for automatic acne object detection and acne severity grading using facial images captured by smartphones. AcneDet includes two models for two tasks: (1) a Faster R-CNN-based deep learning model for the detection of acne lesion objects of four types, including blackheads/whiteheads, papules/pustules, nodules/cysts, and acne scars; and (2) a LightGBM machine learning model for grading acne severity using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. The output of the Faster R-CNN model, i.e., the counts of each acne type, were used as input for the LightGBM model for acne severity grading. A dataset consisting of 1572 labeled facial images captured by both iOS and Android smartphones was used for training. The results show that the Faster R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 0.54 for acne object detection. The mean accuracy of acne severity grading by the LightGBM model is 0.85. With this study, we hope to contribute to the development of artificial intelligent systems to help acne patients better understand their conditions and support doctors in acne diagnosis.},

A critical step in the prevention of mastitis is the diagnosis of the predominant route of transmission of pathogens into either contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV), with environmental being further subdivided as transmission during either the nonlactating "dry" period (EDP) or lactating period (EL). Using data from 1000 farms, random forest algorithms were able to replicate the complex herd level diagnoses made by specialist veterinary clinicians with a high degree of accuracy. An accuracy of 98\%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 86\% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99\% was achieved for the diagnosis of CONT vs ENV (with CONT as a "positive" diagnosis), and an accuracy of 78\%, PPV of 76\% and NPV of 81\% for the diagnosis of EDP vs EL (with EDP as a "positive" diagnosis). An accurate, automated mastitis diagnosis tool has great potential to aid non-specialist veterinary clinicians to make a rapid herd level diagnosis and promptly implement appropriate control measures for an extremely damaging disease in terms of animal health, productivity, welfare and antimicrobial use.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disabling psychiatric disorder associated with consistent deficits in error processing, inhibition and regionally decreased grey matter volumes. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, interviews and questionnaires, which are to some degree subjective and would benefit from verification through biomarkers. Here, pattern recognition of multiple discriminative functional and structural brain patterns was applied to classify adolescents with ADHD and controls. Functional activation features in a Flanker/NoGo task probing error processing and inhibition along with structural magnetic resonance imaging data served to predict group membership using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM pattern recognition algorithm correctly classified 77.78~\% of the subjects with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.78~\% based on error processing. Predictive regions for controls were mainly detected in core areas for error processing and attention such as the medial and dorsolateral frontal areas reflecting deficient processing in ADHD (Hart et al., in Hum Brain Mapp 35:3083–3094, 2014), and overlapped with decreased activations in patients in conventional group comparisons. Regions more predictive for ADHD patients were identified in the posterior cingulate, temporal and occipital cortex. Interestingly despite pronounced univariate group differences in inhibition-related activation and grey matter volumes the corresponding classifiers failed or only yielded a poor discrimination. The present study corroborates the potential of task-related brain activation for classification shown in previous studies. It remains to be clarified whether error processing, which performed best here, also contributes to the discrimination of useful dimensions and subtypes, different psychiatric disorders, and prediction of treatment success across studies and sites.}

We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83\% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90\% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice.

The fuzzy logic (FL) provides an effective means for dealing with uncertainties in the health decision-making process; therefore, FL-based CDSS becomes a very powerful tool for data and knowledge management, being able to think like an expert clinician. This work proposes an FL-based CDSS for the evaluation of renal function in posttransplant patients., METHOD: Based on the data provided by the Department of Nephrology of the University Hospital Federico II of Naples, a statistical sample is selected according to appropriate inclusion criteria. Four fuzzy inference systems are implemented monitoring the renal function by the level of proteinuria and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)., RESULTS: The systems show an accuracy of more than 90\% and the outputs are provided through easy to read graphics, so that physicians can intuitively monitor the patient's clinical status, with the objective to improve drugs dosage and reduce medication errors., CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the CDSSs for the assessment and follow-up of kidney-transplanted patients built in this study are applicable to clinical practice.

  abstract = {Background: A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5\% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7\% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.},

  abstract = {The headlines keep coming in thick and fast on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Medicine. There is rarely a day without a new research article being published with claims of superior accuracy or other performance measure in some medical function. Such research often promises impacts on screening, diagnosis, or monitoring, and increasingly, also on treatment and prediction. While the use of AI has been heralded to revolutionise medicine in numerous specialties, its use in broad clinical applications has been limited. Some countries, including Switzerland, still do not have widespread implementation of basic electronic health records systems upon which more advanced AI applications can be solidly built. Such intensive publicity exaggerating a technology's potential benefits must be referred to as a "hype". Artificial Intelligence as a field developed in the 1950s, when computer technology advanced and its use expanded rapidly. Since then, periods of excitement about its potential and vast funding were often followed by periods of disillusionment and de-funding, which were termed "AI winters" in the early nineties [2]. The field has benefited from vast funding by both private and public sectors and the frenzy of research \& development activity from Pharma/ MedTech, start-ups and big tech players. With the onset of more widespread adoption [3], at least some of these developments will ultimately find their way into clinical practice. Technological developments and implementations often follow the hype cycle, and this will likely also extend to AI [4]. Whether we are ready for what is currently happening is another question rarely discussed. In this viewpoint, we would like to briefly introduce: 1) what artificial intelligence in medicine is, 2) what elements constitute readiness and 3) what main arguments can be brought forward by each side of the debate on whether we are ready for Medical AI.(Figure presented)Copyright © 2022 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

  abstract = {The paper considers the problem of handling short sets of medical data. Effectively solving this problem will provide the ability to solve numerous classification and regression tasks in case of limited data in health decision support systems. Many similar tasks arise in various fields of medicine. The authors improved the regression method of data analysis based on artificial neural networks by introducing additional elements into the formula for calculating the output signal of the existing RBF-based input-doubling method. This improvement provides averaging of the result, which is typical for ensemble methods, and allows compensating for the errors of different signs of the predicted values. These two advantages make it possible to significantly increase the accuracy of the methods of this class. It should be noted that the duration of the training algorithm of the advanced method remains the same as for existing method. Experimental modeling was performed using a real short medical data. The regression task in rheumatology was solved based on only 77 observations. The optimal parameters of the method, which provide the highest prediction accuracy based on MAE and RMSE, were selected experimentally. A comparison of its efficiency with other methods of this class has been performed. The highest accuracy of the proposed RBF-based additive input-doubling method among the considered ones is established. The method can be modified by using other nonlinear artificial intelligence tools to implement its training and application algorithms and such methods can be applied in various fields of medicine.},

Design: Development and validation of information extraction applications for ascertaining symptoms of SMI in routine mental health records using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource; description of their distribution in a corpus of discharge summaries. Setting: Electronic records from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment of 1.2 million residents in four boroughs of south London, UK. Participants: The distribution of derived symptoms was described in 23 128 discharge summaries from 7962 patients who had received an SMI diagnosis, and 13 496 discharge summaries from 7575 patients who had received a non-SMI diagnosis. Outcome measures: Fifty SMI symptoms were identified by a team of psychiatrists for extraction based on salience and linguistic consistency in records, broadly categorised under positive, negative, disorganisation, manic and catatonic subgroups. Text models for each symptom were generated using the TextHunter tool and the CRIS database. Results: We extracted data for 46 symptoms with a median F1 score of 0.88. Four symptom models performed poorly and were excluded. From the corpus of discharge summaries, it was possible to extract symptomatology in 87\% of patients with SMI and 60\% of patients with non-SMI diagnosis. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the possibility of automatically extracting a broad range of SMI symptoms from English text discharge summaries for patients with an SMI diagnosis. Descriptive data also indicated that most symptoms cut across diagnoses, rather than being restricted to particular groups.},

We also seek to identify the roles of moderating variables on each UTAUT path. A total of 364 path coefficients from 127 studies were relevant for data analysis. CMA software V3 was employed to combine the effect sizes. All UTAUT relationships were found to be significant. Performance expectancy emerged as the strongest antecedent of usage intention. We also find that usage intention is the most critical predictor of use behavior. It was also revealed that sample size and culture significantly moderated the linkages between facilitating conditions and usage intention, effort expectancy and usage intention, and usage intention and use behavior. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are also discussed toward the end.},

  abstract = {Information needs for understanding cell divisions in the human body is important in the learning process. Although sketches, images and blocks of 3D puzzles were used for teaching and learning, unfortunately those tools are static and incapable of being manipulated. Hence, digital information is the best tool for the teaching and learning of cell divisions in the human body via software applications. A cell motion is a digital information application developed using leap motion to demonstrate cell movement in the human body. However, the factors that influence students towards adopting this application are not obvious and often ignored. The method for evaluating the factors influencing its user's acceptance is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) via a questionnaire distributed among medical students to gain statistically valid quantitative results through hypothesis-testing. The result indicates that digital information needs for the understanding of cell divisions in the human body are influenced by the user's Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU). However, the Attitude (AT) towards use did have a significant effect on PU and PEOU. Moreover, PEOU had a strong and significant influence on PU, while AT positively influenced users' behavioural intention (BI) of using digital information needs for the understanding of cell divisions in the human body.},

Technological innovations may improve our ability to reach underserved populations by overcoming many existing barriers. We evaluated a brief, automated risk assessment and intervention platform designed to increase the use of crisis resources provided to those online and in crisis. Method: Participants, users of the digital mental health app Koko, were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions upon accessing the app and were included in the study after their posts were identified by machine learning classifiers as signaling a current mental health crisis. Participants in the treatment condition received a brief Barrier Reduction Intervention (BRI) designed to increase the use of crisis service referrals provided on the app. Participants were followed up several hours later to assess the use of crisis services. Results: Only about one quarter of participants in a crisis (21.8\%) reported being “very likely” to use clinical referrals provided to them, with the most commonly endorsed barriers being they “just want to chat” or their “thoughts are too intense.” Among participants providing follow-up data (41.3\%), receipt of the BRI was associated with a 23\% increase in the use of crisis services. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a brief, automated BRI can be efficacious on digital platforms, even among individuals experiencing acute psychological distress. The potential to increase help seeking and service utilization with such procedures holds promise for those in need of psychiatric services.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Machine learning models trained on electronic health records have achieved high prognostic accuracy in test datasets, but little is known about their embedding into clinical workflows. We implemented a random forest-based algorithm to identify hospitalized patients at high risk for delirium, and evaluated its performance in a clinical setting., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Delirium was predicted at admission and recalculated on the evening of admission. The defined prediction outcome was a delirium coded for the recent hospital stay. During 7 months of prospective evaluation, 5530 predictions were analyzed. In addition, 119 predictions for internal medicine patients were compared with ratings of clinical experts in a blinded and nonblinded setting., RESULTS: During clinical application, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 74.1\% and a specificity of 82.2\%. Discrimination on prospective data (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.86) was as good as in the test dataset, but calibration was poor. The predictions correlated strongly with delirium risk perceived by experts in the blinded (r = 0.81) and nonblinded (r = 0.62) settings. A major advantage of our setting was the timely prediction without additional data entry., DISCUSSION: The implemented machine learning algorithm achieved a stable performance predicting delirium in high agreement with expert ratings, but improvement of calibration is needed. Future research should evaluate the acceptance of implemented machine learning algorithms by health professionals., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the implementation process of a machine learning algorithm into a clinical workflow and demonstrates its predictive power for delirium.

Despite intense research on machine learning for the prediction of clinical outcomes, the acceptance of the integration of such complex models in clinical routine remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate user acceptance of an already implemented machine learning-based application predicting the risk of delirium for in-patients. We applied a mixed methods design to collect opinions and concerns from health care professionals including physicians and nurses who regularly used the application. The evaluation was framed by the Technology Acceptance Model assessing perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, actual system use and output quality of the application. Questionnaire results from 47 nurses and physicians as well as qualitative results of four expert group meetings rated the overall usefulness of the delirium prediction positively. For healthcare professionals, the visualization and presented information was understandable, the application was easy to use and the additional information for delirium management was appreciated. The application did not increase their workload, but the actual system use was still low during the pilot study. Our study provides insights into the user acceptance of a machine learning-based application supporting delirium management in hospitals. In order to improve quality and safety in healthcare, computerized decision support should predict actionable events and be highly accepted by users.},

Empirical reviews demonstrate that wide acceptance of EV is still difficult to achieve. This research proposes to investigate the factors that might trigger the wide usage of EVs to support the energy policy. The real-world owners of EV were extracted from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which provides large-scale individual characteristics. NHTS dataset was processed to establish the comprehensive estimation model for EV adoption with considering vehicle, personal and household factors. Besides the commonly social-economic factors, the gasoline price and car sharing program were found to be significant for EV adoption. Additionally, since the EV owners are only 1.29\% of all vehicle owners, this article introduced the imbalanced dataset technique, which was seldom considered in existing researches. Subsequently, several machine learning methods were utilized to build the prediction model, and the model performance analysis indicates the Decision Tree (DT) model outperforms other models. A regional EV penetration map was also generated for the U.S. to validate the proposed approach. Implications for further research, transport policy and EV market are discussed.},

Objective To implement the voice smart care (VSC) system in hospital wards and explore patient acceptance via the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods A structured questionnaire based on TAM was developed and validated as a research tool. Only the patients hospitalized in the VSC wards and who used it for more than two days were invited to fill the questionnaire. Statistical variables were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0. A total of 30 valid questionnaires were finally obtained after excluding two incomplete questionnaires. Cronbach's alpha values for all study constructs were above 0.84. Result We observed that perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness, perceived usefulness on user satisfaction and attitude toward using, and attitude toward using on behavioral intention to use had statistical significance (p {$<$} .01), respectively. Conclusion We have successfully developed the VSC system in a Taiwanese academic medical center. Our study indicated that perceived usefulness was a crucial factor, which means the system function should precisely meet the patients' demands. Additionally, a clever system design is important since perceived ease of use positively affects perceived usefulness. The insight generated from this study could be beneficial to hospitals when implementing similar systems to their wards.},

This project was part of the 2010 Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/Veterans Affairs (VA) natural-language-processing challenge., DESIGN: The authors implemented a machine-learning-based named entity recognition system for clinical text and systematically evaluated the contributions of different types of features and ML algorithms, using a training corpus of 349 annotated notes. Based on the results from training data, the authors developed a novel hybrid clinical entity extraction system, which integrated heuristic rule-based modules with the ML-base named entity recognition module. The authors applied the hybrid system to the concept extraction and assertion classification tasks in the challenge and evaluated its performance using a test data set with 477 annotated notes., MEASUREMENTS: Standard measures including precision, recall, and F-measure were calculated using the evaluation script provided by the Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/VA challenge organizers. The overall performance for all three types of clinical entities and all six types of assertions across 477 annotated notes were considered as the primary metric in the challenge., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Systematic evaluation on the training set showed that Conditional Random Fields outperformed Support Vector Machines, and semantic information from existing natural-language-processing systems largely improved performance, although contributions from different types of features varied. The authors' hybrid entity extraction system achieved a maximum overall F-score of 0.8391 for concept extraction (ranked second) and 0.9313 for assertion classification (ranked fourth, but not statistically different than the first three systems) on the test data set in the challenge.},

  abstract = {Background and objective The Accident and Emergency Department (A\&ED) is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately, relative A\&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years, which leads to overcrowding in A\&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A\&ED patient flow under different triage levels, by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks. Methods Administrative data is collected from an actual A\&ED and categorized into five groups based on different triage levels. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection algorithm is improved and implemented as a pre-processing step for this time-series prediction problem, in order to explore key features affecting patient flow. In our improved GA, a fitness-based crossover is proposed to maintain the joint information of multiple features during iterative process, instead of traditional point-based crossover. Deep neural networks (DNN) is employed as the prediction model to utilize their universal adaptability and high flexibility. In the model-training process, the learning algorithm is well-configured based on a parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Two effective regularization strategies are integrated in one DNN framework to avoid overfitting. All introduced hyper-parameters are optimized efficiently by grid-search in one pass. Results As for feature selection, our improved GA-based feature selection algorithm has outperformed a typical GA and four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms (mRMR, SAFS, VIFR, and CFR). As for the prediction accuracy of proposed integrated framework, compared with other frequently used statistical models (GLM, seasonal-ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ANN) and modern machine models (SVM-RBF, SVM-linear, RF, and R-LASSO), the proposed integrated "DNN-I-GA" framework achieves higher prediction accuracy on both MAPE and RMSE metrics in pairwise comparisons. Conclusions The contribution of our study is two-fold. Theoretically, the traditional GA-based feature selection process is improved to have less hyper-parameters and higher efficiency, and the joint information of multiple features is maintained by fitness-based crossover operator. The universal property of DNN is further enhanced by merging different regularization strategies. Practically, features selected by our improved GA can be used to acquire an underlying relationship between patient flows and input features. Predictive values are significant indicators of patients' demand and can be used by A\&ED managers to make resource planning and allocation. High accuracy achieved by the present framework in different cases enhances the reliability of downstream decision makings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide phenotypic range, often affecting personality and communication. Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of ASD have identified both gray- and white-matter volume changes. However, the cerebral cortex is a 2-D sheet with a highly folded and curved geometry, which VBM cannot directly measure. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) has the advantage of being able to measure cortical surface features, such as thickness. The goals of this study were twofold: to construct diagnostic models for ASD, based on regional thickness measurements extracted from SBM, and to compare these models to diagnostic models based on volumetric morphometry. Our study included 22 subjects with ASD (mean age 9.2±2.1 years) and 16 volunteer controls (mean age 10.0±1.9 years). Using SBM, we obtained regional cortical thicknesses for 66 brain structures for each subject. In addition, we obtained volumes for the same 66 structures for these subjects. To generate diagnostic models, we employed four machine-learning techniques: support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), functional trees (FTs), and logistic model trees (LMTs). We found that thickness-based diagnostic models were superior to those based on regional volumes. For thickness-based classification, LMT achieved the best classification performance, with accuracy=87\%, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.93, sensitivity=95\%, and specificity=75\%. For volume-based classification, LMT achieved the highest accuracy, with accuracy=74\%, AUC=0.77, sensitivity=77\%, and specificity=69\%. The thickness-based diagnostic model generated by LMT included 7 structures. Relative to controls, children with ASD had decreased cortical thickness in the left and right pars triangularis, left medial orbitofrontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left frontal pole, and increased cortical thickness in the left caudal anterior cingulate and left precuneus. Overall, thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification across a variety of classification methods.},

  abstract = {Autism is widely believed to be a heterogeneous disorder; diagnosis is currently based solely on clinical criteria, although genetic, as well as environmental, influences are thought to be prominent factors in the etiology of most forms of autism. Our goal is to determine whether a predictive model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can predict symptom severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We divided 118 ASD children into a mild/moderate autism group (n = 65) and a severe autism group (n = 53), based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). For each child, we obtained 29 SNPs of 9 ASD-related genes. To generate predictive models, we employed three machine-learning techniques: decision stumps (DSs), alternating decision trees (ADTrees), and FlexTrees. DS and FlexTree generated modestly better classifiers, with accuracy = 67\%, sensitivity = 0.88 and specificity = 0.42. The SNP rs878960 in GABRB3 was selected by all models, and was related associated with CARS assessment. Our results suggest that SNPs have the potential to offer accurate classification of ASD symptom severity.},

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background: The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) is the first and only nationally representative study on late-life cognition and dementia in India (n=4096). LASI-DAD obtained clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia for a subsample of 2528 respondents. Objective(s): This study develops a machine learning model that uses data from the clinical consensus diagnosis in LASI-DAD to support the classification of dementia status. Method(s): Clinicians were presented with the extensive data collected from LASI-DAD, including sociodemographic information and health history of respondents, results from the screening tests of cognitive status, and information obtained from informant interviews. Based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and using an online platform, clinicians individually evaluated each case and then reached a consensus diagnosis. A 2-step procedure was implemented to train several candidate machine learning models, which were evaluated using a separate test set for predictive accuracy measurement, including the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and kappa statistic. The ultimate model was selected based on overall agreement as measured by kappa. We further examined the overall accuracy and agreement with the final consensus diagnoses between the selected machine learning model and individual clinicians who participated in the clinical consensus diagnostic process. Finally, we applied the selected model to a subgroup of LASI-DAD participants for whom the clinical consensus diagnosis was not obtained to predict their dementia status. Result(s): Among the 2528 individuals who received clinical consensus diagnosis, 192 (6.7\% after adjusting for sampling weight) were diagnosed with dementia. All candidate machine learning models achieved outstanding discriminative ability, as indicated by AUROC {$>$}.90, and had similar accuracy and specificity (both around 0.95). The support vector machine model outperformed other models with the highest sensitivity (0.81), F1 score (0.72), and kappa (.70, indicating substantial agreement) and the second highest precision (0.65). As a result, the support vector machine was selected as the ultimate model. Further examination revealed that overall accuracy and agreement were similar between the selected model and individual clinicians. Application of the prediction model on 1568 individuals without clinical consensus diagnosis classified 127 individuals as living with dementia. After applying sampling weight, we can estimate the prevalence of dementia in the population as 7.4\%. Conclusion(s): The selected machine learning model has outstanding discriminative ability and substantial agreement with a clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia. The model can serve as a computer model of the clinical knowledge and experience encoded in the clinical consensus diagnostic process and has many potential applications, including predicting missed dementia diagnoses and serving as a clinical decision support tool or virtual rater to assist diagnosis of dementia.Copyright © Haomiao Jin, Sandy Chien, Erik Meijer, Pranali Khobragade, Jinkook Lee.},

The errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the study as the final number of meta-analysable studies are the same as originally reported.] A meta-analysis examining temporal changes (time trends) in the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment for unipolar depression was conducted. A comprehensive search of psychotherapy trials yielded 70 eligible studies from 1977 to 2014. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified as Hedge’s g based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Rates of remission were also registered. The publication year of each study was examined as a linear metaregression predictor of ES, and as part of a 2-way interaction with other moderators (Year × Moderator). The average ES of the BDI was 1.58 (95\% CI [1.43, 1.74]), and 1.69 for the HRSD (95\% CI [1.48, 1.89]). Subgroup analyses revealed that women profited more from therapy than did men (p {$<$} .05). Experienced psychologists (g = 1.55) achieved better results (p {$<$} .01) than less experienced student therapists (g = 0.98). The metaregressions examining the temporal trends indicated that the effects of CBT have declined linearly and steadily since its introduction, as measured by patients’ self-reports (the BDI, p {$<$} .001), clinicians’ ratings (the HRSD, p {$<$} .01) and rates of remission (p {$<$} .01). Subgroup analyses confirmed that the declining trend was present in both within-group (pre/post) designs (p {$<$} .01) and controlled trial designs (p = .02). Thus, modern CBT clinical trials seemingly provided less relief from depressive symptoms as compared with the seminal trials. Potential causes and possible implications for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here, we demonstrate an open-source predictive analytics platform that applies machine-learning techniques to a common data model; we develop and validate a predictive model of antihyperglycemic medication cessation (validated proxy for A1c control) in patients with treated T2D who underwent MxS., METHODS: We selected patients meeting the following criteria in 2 large US healthcare claims databases (Truven Health MarketScan Commercial [CCAE]; Optum Clinformatics [Optum]): underwent MxS between January 1, 2007, to October 1, 2013 (first = index); aged {$>$}=18 years; continuous enrollment 180 days pre-index (baseline) to 730 days postindex; baseline T2D diagnosis and treatment. The outcome was no antihyperglycemic medication treatment from 365 to 730 days after MxS. A regularized logistic regression model was trained using the following candidate predictor categories measured at baseline: demographics, conditions, medications, measurements, and procedures. A 75\% to 25\% split of the CCAE group was used for model training and testing; the Optum group was used for external validation., RESULTS: 13 050 (CCAE) and 3477 (Optum) patients met the study inclusion criteria. Antihyperglycemic medication cessation rates were 72.9\% (CCAE) and 70.8\% (Optum). The model possessed good internal discriminative accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.778 [95\% CI = 0.761-0.795] in CCAE test set N = 3527) and transportability (external AUC = 0.759 [95\% CI = 0.741-0.777] in Optum N = 3477)., CONCLUSION: The application of machine learning techniques to real-world healthcare data can yield useful predictive models to assist patient selection.

Depression and mental illness are a key problem in society nowadays. It can cause a loss of interest in general activities that can lead to suicidal thoughts. Hence, the need of an automated system that can help in detecting depression in people of various age groups is being realized. In order to detect depression,Researchers have been looking for approaches to effectively identify depression. A number of studies have been proposed in this regard. Here, In this study, we are analysing various existing studies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and diverse Machine Learning (ML) techniques being used to detect depression. Apart from it, different approaches used to detect emotion and mood in an individual are discussed. This study analyses how facial expressions, images, emotional chatbots and texts on social media platforms can be effectual in detecting one’s emotions and then depression. Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) – Radial Neural Networks (RNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector, etc. are the various ML techniques used to recognize emotions from text processing; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for feature extraction and classifications of images to detect emotions through facial expressions. This paper aims to provide the survey of various AI and ML techniques which help in the detection and analysis of emotion and hence depression along with their related research issues.},

This study explores sepsis CDS implementation from the perspective of implementation leads by describing the motivations, tool choices, and implementation experiences of a diverse group of implementers. Material(s) and Method(s): Semi-structured interviews were conducted with and a questionnaire was administered to 21 hospital leaders overseeing CDS implementation at 15 US medical centers. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling. Responses were coded by 2 coders with consensus approach and inductively analyzed for themes. Result(s): Use of sepsis CDS is motivated in part by quality metrics for sepsis patients. Choice of tool is driven by ease of integration, customization capability, and perceived predictive potential. Implementation processes for these CDS tools are complex, time-consuming, interdisciplinary undertakings resulting in heterogeneous choice of tools and workflow integration. To improve clinician acceptance, implementers addressed both optimization of the alerts as well as clinician understanding and buy in. More distrust and confusion was reported for ML models, as compared to RB models. Respondents described a variety of approaches to overcome implementation barriers; these approaches related to alert firing, content, integration, and buy-in. Discussion(s): While there are shared socio-technical challenges of implementing CDS for both RB and ML models, attention to user education, support, expectation management, and dissemination of effective practices may improve feasibility and effectiveness of ML models in quality improvement efforts. Conclusion(s): Further implementation science research is needed to determine real world efficacy of these tools. Clinician acceptance is a significant barrier to sepsis CDS implementation. Successful implementation of less clinically intuitive ML models may require additional attention to user confusion and distrust.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Academics and practitioners alike have recognized the worth of job satisfaction, given its usefulness in predicting vital organizational effectiveness outcomes (Judge \& Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012; Society for Human Resource Management, 2015). In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the job satisfaction literature. First, we discuss the history of job satisfaction and how the construct has been explicated and refined over time. Second, we describe the various paradigms and approaches to the measurement of job satisfaction, along with important measurement considerations. Third, we review the antecedents (dispositional, contextual, and event-based) and outcomes (performance, effectiveness, organizational citizenship behavior [OCB], counterproductive work behavior [CWB], and withdrawal) of job satisfaction. Finally, we synthesize decades of job satisfaction research to suggest how the study of job satisfaction can move forward. As some examples, we suggest researchers employ theory elaboration (Fisher \& Aguinis, 2017) approaches to prune and elaborate on job satisfaction theory and that researchers continue to delve into clarifying the role of affect in job satisfaction. We also suggest that practitioners closely focus on the determinants of job satisfaction, especially justice perceptions, which strongly predict job satisfaction. We conclude that a continued focus on job satisfaction is critically important:~in the tumultuous modern climate wrought with high turnover rates, satisfied employees are more likely to be loyal champions, ambassadors, and advocates to their organizations.},

This paper is an extended work related to our previous work (1). In our previous work we used k-means algorithm to detect and diagnosis breast cancer tumor's region. However, to find the better results from the algorithm we need to add more numerical parameters of the breast cancer image and this algorithm has limited usage when applied with more number of parameters. Even if the cancer tumor is abnormal it was quite difficult to distinguish among those tumors. This paper summarizes the different comparative study of neural network algorithms to get the best classification of the breast cancer and explains how to acquire more numerical parameters from the breast cancer image data, so that it can help doctors to diagnosis efficiently between benign and malignance tumors.},

  abstract = {The Arden Syntax is an HL7 standard language for representing medical knowledge as logic statements. Despite nearly 2 decades of availability, Arden Syntax has not been widely used. This has been attributed to the lack of a generally available compiler to implement the logic, to Arden's complex syntax, to the challenges of mapping local data to data references in the Medical Logic Modules (MLMs), or, more globally, to the general absence of decision support in healthcare computing. An XML representation (ArdenML) may partially address the technical challenges. MLMs created in ArdenML can be converted into executable files using standard transforms written in the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) language. As an example, we have demonstrated an approach to executing MLMs written in ArdenML using the Drools business rule management system. Extensions to ArdenML make it possible to generate a user interface through which an MLM developer can test for logical errors.},

Materials and Methods During a national meeting for AI, eHealth, and IT infrastructure in 2019, we conducted a survey to obtain participants’ attitudes. A total of 123 participants completed 28 items exploring AI usage in medicine. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between radiologists, IT specialists, and industry representatives. Results The strongest agreement between all respondents occurred with the following: plausibility checks are important to understand the decisions of the AI (93\% agreement), validation of AI algorithms is mandatory (91\%), and medicine becomes more efficient in the age of AI (86\%). In contrast, only 25\% of the respondents had confidence in the AI results, and only 17\% believed that medicine will become more human through the use of AI. The answers were significantly different between the three professions for four items: relevance for protocol selection in cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.034), medical societies should be involved in validation (p = 0.028), patients should be informed about the use of AI (p = 0.047), and AI should be part of medical education (p = 0.026). Conclusion Currently, a discrepancy exists between high expectations for the future role of AI and low confidence in the results. This attitude was similar across all three groups. The demand for plausibility checks and the need to prove the usefulness in randomized controlled studies indicate what is needed in future research.},

The study draws on rich qualitative data from a revelatory case study of an AI system for stroke diagnosis at a University Hospital to elaborate how three sensemaking processes revolve around confirming and disconfirming AI assessments. Through context-specific sensedemanding, sensegiving, and sensebreaking, radiologists develop distinct usage patterns of AI systems. The study reveals that diagnostic self-efficacy influences which of the three sensemaking processes radiologists engage in. In deriving six propositions, the account of sensemaking and usage of diagnostic AI systems in medical practice paves the way for future research.},

This paper proposed the Central Nervous System (CNS) interaction using the Skeleton Joints Moment (SJM) approach for dimension reduction with k Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) for hand gesture classification. Over the past few decades, researchers have proposed various techniques in dimension reduction. One of the methods is principal component analysis (PCA). Experimental results indicated that the SJM technique has similar accuracy to PCA, where both methods showed 96\% of prediction using hand skeleton joints data. In addition, PCA has a higher uncertainty of mean error 0.75 compared to SJM at only 0.01. Furthermore, PCA has the worst complexity of O(min(p(3), n(3))) where SJM O(n/d). Evaluation results using the T-Test showed a significant difference between SJM and PCA where p {$<$} 0.05. Thus, there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are means to provide evidence-based medical knowledge. In order to make up-to-date "best" scientific evidence available these documents need to be updated on an ongoing basis. An effective method to accomplish this aim is offered by the so-called "living guidelines": Living guidelines are documents presenting up-to-date and state-of-the-art knowledge to practitioners. To have guidelines implemented by computer-support they have to be formalized in a computer-interpretable form in a first step. Due to the complexity of such formats the formalization process is burdensome and time-consuming. Automating parts of the modeling process and, consequently, modeling updates of these guideline documents are demanded., METHODS AND MATERIAL: The LASSIE methodology supports this task by formalizing guidelines in several steps from the textual form to the guideline representation language Asbru using a document-centric approach. LASSIE uses information extraction techniques to semi-automatically accomplish these steps. We apply LASSIE to support the implementation of living guidelines., RESULTS: Based on a living guideline published by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) we show that adaptations of previously formalized guidelines can be accomplished easily and fast. Thereby, the different versions of guideline documents are compared and updates are identified. Due to the traceable formalization method of linking text parts and their corresponding formal models, we are able to inherit unchanged models from previously formalized versions. Thus, we only need to formalize updated text parts using the semi-automatic formalization method LASSIE., CONCLUSION: We propose a simple, time-saving, but effective method called LASSIE to formalize new guideline versions of previously formalized CPGs. Furthermore, models that have been added or modified by knowledge engineers in previous versions can also be transferred easily. This will result in a faster implementation of new guideline versions also known as living guidelines to provide up-to-date knowledge necessary for accomplishing the daily work of health care professionals.},

  abstract = {Dynamic and flexible systems offer huge advantages for businesses in addressing dynamic uncertain factors and implementing dynamic business processes (DBP). However, DBP remains a challenge from the perspectives of modeling, simulation, and implementation because of a nontrivial understanding of "What is a dynamic business process?" A variety of approaches for DBP modeling and implementation have been proposed over the past years, yet few comprehensive studies analyzing DBP from different particular perspectives (e.g., business process (BP) variability, aspect oriented BP, service compositions, etc.) and research questions that lay the foundation for the development of a meaning of a DBP have been reported. The motivation behind this review is to examine DBP meaning from a global perspective and, consequently, answer the previously presented research question. Therefore, in this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) comprised of 67 papers from five respective digital libraries, which index Computer Science (CS), Information Systems (IS), and Software Engineering (SE) journals and conference proceedings. Two points of view are analyzed in the selected papers. First, we observe the similarities and differences between the proposed approaches to DBP modeling and implementation. From these observations, we define six main requirements for DBP (DBPR). In addition, the comparison of the selected papers according to DBPR shows that most of the approaches analyzed limit BP dynamicity, since they use partially predefined BP models. Secondly, we analyze the papers based on a visualization perspective that shows the less explored areas as follows: more flexible process modeling approach and its implementation in IS should be developed; usage of historic data should be extended; domain knowledge usage, like goal-orientation, multi-criteria optimization, domain knowledge, artificial intelligence, etc., should be included and extended to ensure BP dynamicity. As such, this study makes important contributions and serves as a useful resource for future DBP studies and practice. Moreover, we expect that our results could inspire researchers and practitioners towards further work aimed at bringing forward the field of DBP modeling and implementation.},

Most of these studies primarily use clinical data, but models might benefit from additional neuroimaging, blood and genetic data to improve accuracy. Combined, multimodal models might offer potential for stratification of patients for treatment. Clinical implementation of machine learning is impeded by a lack of wider generalisability, with efforts primarily focused on psychosis and dementia. Studies across all diagnostic groups should work to test the robustness of machine learning models, which is an essential first step to clinical implementation, and then move to prospective clinical validation. Models need to exceed clinicians’ heuristics to be useful, and safe, in routine decision-making. Engagement of clinicians, researchers and patients in digitalisation and ‘big data’ approaches are vital to allow the generation and accessibility of large, longitudinal, prospective data needed for precision psychiatry to be applied into real-world psychiatric care.},

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the knowledge of basic principles, limitations, and applications of AI in healthcare among medical students and doctors of a developing country. Methods Two free webinars were hosted for doctors and medical students in northern India (Punjab state) to create awareness about the role of AI in healthcare and the recent advancements made in various medical specialties. The delegates' perceptions about their knowledge and interest in AI were ascertained using the Likert scale (1= low, 5 = high) in the post-event questionnaire. Using Chi-square and cross-tabulation analysis, associations were examined between knowledge of AI, gender, medical experience, and other variables. Results Out of the total of 621 registrants, 367 filled the post-event questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Although the majority felt that AI will play an important role in delivering healthcare services in the future (74.4\%), they did not feel knowledgeable about the applications (79.6\%) and limitations of AI (82.8\%). A relatively lesser proportion of doctors (51.6\%) felt interested to learn more about AI than medical students (69.3\%). Furthermore, a lesser proportion of doctors (65.2\%) felt that AI will be beneficial for their career as a doctor as compared with medical students (84.4\%). The majority of medical students (83.5\%) had never attended any webinar/lecture or course on AI in healthcare and felt that they have received minimal advice (80.7\%) from their medical school on teaching about AI and its applications. A significantly (P= 0.001) higher proportion of female medical students were unknowledgeable about the principles and applications of AI than male respondents. However, female medical students were significantly (P= 0.004) more interested than male medical students to learn about AI. Conclusions Formal training courses to teach about AI should be focused on to facilitate coherent and scientifically supported dissemination of knowledge in medical schools and hospitals. Further large-scale studies are needed to understand the perception and attitude of medical students and doctors regarding AI to steer policy development and medical education curriculum changes to spark an interest in emerging technologies and drive innovation.},

The fast-changing innovations in digital technologies of IIoT like the internet of things, robotics, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics trigger in-depth analysis of professionals' learning behavior. This study extends the individual's ambidextrous learning theory and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to develop a quantitative behavioral model Learning Emerging Digital Skills (LEDS). LEDS model describes the antecedents of professionals' learning behavior towards fast-changing emerging digital technologies involved in IIoT. A nation-wide structured survey of 685 professionals across 95 firms in India across industry sectors engaged in IIoT product and solution development in sectors like automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and energy were undertaken. Findings from structural equation modeling are validated via a qualitative study. Social influence and personal innovativeness, anxiety, long-term consequence, and job relevance affect behavioral intention to learn. Professionals' performance level and technology preference moderate the relationship between antecedents and the intention to learn. For exceptional performers, personal innovativeness is the key driver in the intention to learn. For average performers, social influence and anxiety are additional significant factors towards intention to learn. Technology itself moderates the learning behavior, which indicates professionals' preference to learn a technology over the other based on technology maturity and use potential. This study can help practitioners design ramp-up strategies to meet the current and future demand of emerging digital skills to meet their IIoT strategy.

However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine.                                            Methods                To define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in health and personalized care. However, the adoption of data-driven approaches in many clinical settings has been hampered due to their inability to perform in a reliable and safe manner to leverage accurate and trustworthy diagnoses. A critical and challenging usage scenario for AI is aiding the treatment of cancerous conditions. Providing accurate diagnosis for cancer is a challenging problem in precision oncology. Although machine learning (ML)-based approaches are very effective at cancer susceptibility prediction and subsequent treatment recommendations, ML models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Since adversarially weak models can lead to wrong clinical recommendations, such vulnerabilities is critical - especially when AI-guided systems are used to aid medical doctors. Therefore, it is indispensable that healthcare professionals employ trustworthy AI tools for predicting and assessing disease risks and progression. In this paper, we propose an adversary-aware multimodal convolutional autoencoder (MCAE) model for cancer susceptibility prediction from multi-omics data consisting of copy number variations (CNVs), miRNA expression, and gene expression (GE). Based on different representational learning techniques, the MCAE model learns multimodal feature representations from multi-omics data, followed by classifying the patient cohorts into different cancer types on multimodal embedding space that exhibit similar characteristics in end-to-end setting. To make the MCAE model robust to adversaries and to provide consistent diagnosis, we formulate robustness as a property, such that predictions remain stable with regard to small variations in the input. We study different adversarial attacks scenarios and take both proactive and reactive measures (e.g., adversarial retraining and identification of adversarial inputs). Experiment results show that the MCAE model based on latent representation concatenation (LRC) exhibits high confidence at predicting cancer types, giving an average precision and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores of 0.9625 and 0.8453, respectively and shows higher robustness when compared with state-of-the-art approaches against different attack scenarios w.r.t.

There are always at least two contexts involved in the use of such systems: the expert knowledge-provider context and the end-user context. To show this, we present examples of context-dependent aspects significant to the use of decision-support systems. The existence of discrepancies between the contexts threatens to disrupt the rationale for using decision-support systems: for the system to transfer knowledge from the expert to the end-user. Both theoretical and empirical studies show that such discrepancies exist and that they may be detrimental to the use of decision-support systems. Systems must thus give support in interpreting the output produced by the system in the context of the end-user.},

  abstract = {Background. It is well known that web-based interventions can be effective treatments for depression. However, dropout rates in web-based interventions are typically high, especially in self-guided web-based interventions. Rigorous empirical evidence regarding factors influencing dropout in self-guided web-based interventions is lacking due to small study sample sizes. In this paper we examined predictors of dropout in an individual patient data meta-analysis to gain a better understanding of who may benefit from these interventions. Method. A comprehensive literature search for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy for adults with depression from 2006 to January 2013 was conducted. Next, we approached authors to collect the primary data of the selected studies. Predictors of dropout, such as socio-demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics were examined. Results. Data from 2705 participants across ten RCTs of self-guided web-based interventions for depression were analysed. The multivariate analysis indicated that male gender [relative risk (RR) 1.08], lower educational level (primary education, RR 1.26) and co-morbid anxiety symptoms (RR 1.18) significantly increased the risk of dropping out, while for every additional 4 years of age, the risk of dropping out significantly decreased (RR 0.94). Conclusions. Dropout can be predicted by several variables and is not randomly distributed. This knowledge may inform tailoring of online self-help interventions to prevent dropout in identified groups at risk.},

Thus, safety concerns remain and hamper the implementation of self-guided iCBT into clinical practice. We aimed to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of clinically significant deterioration (symptom worsening) in adults with depressive symptoms who received self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions. Several socio-demographic, clinical and study-level variables were tested as potential moderators of deterioration. Methods. Randomised controlled trials that reported results of self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions in adults with symptoms of depression were selected. Mixed effects models with participants nested within studies were used to examine possible clinically significant deterioration rates. Results. Thirteen out of 16 eligible trials were included in the present IPD meta-analysis. Of the 3805 participants analysed, 7.2\% showed clinically significant deterioration (5.8\% and 9.1\% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively). Participants in self-guided iCBT were less likely to deteriorate (OR 0.62, p {$<$} 0.001) compared with control conditions. None of the examined participant- and study-level moderators were significantly associated with deterioration rates. Conclusions. Self-guided iCBT has a lower rate of negative outcomes on symptoms than control conditions and could be a first step treatment approach for adult depression as well as an alternative to watchful waiting in general practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enabled healthcare is now feasible for many health systems, yet little is known about effective strategies of system architecture and governance mechanisms for implementation. Our objective was to identify the different computational and organizational setups that early-adopter health systems have utilized to integrate AI/ML clinical decision support (AI-CDS) and scrutinize their trade-offs., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted structured interviews with health systems with AI deployment experience about their organizational and computational setups for deploying AI-CDS at point of care., RESULTS: We contacted 34 health systems and interviewed 20 healthcare sites (58\% response rate). Twelve (60\%) sites used the native electronic health record vendor configuration for model development and deployment, making it the most common shared infrastructure. Nine (45\%) sites used alternative computational configurations which varied significantly. Organizational configurations for managing AI-CDS were distinguished by how they identified model needs, built and implemented models, and were separable into 3 major types: Decentralized translation (n = 10, 50\%), IT Department led (n = 2, 10\%), and AI in Healthcare (AIHC) Team (n = 8, 40\%)., DISCUSSION: No singular computational configuration enables all current use cases for AI-CDS. Health systems need to consider their desired applications for AI-CDS and whether investment in extending the off-the-shelf infrastructure is needed. Each organizational setup confers trade-offs for health systems planning strategies to implement AI-CDS., CONCLUSION: Health systems will be able to use this framework to understand strengths and weaknesses of alternative organizational and computational setups when designing their strategy for artificial intelligence.

Here we used BoNE to query an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)-map and prioritize a therapeutic strategy that involves dual agonism of two nuclear receptors, PPAR alpha/gamma. Balanced agonism of PPAR alpha/gamma was predicted to modulate macrophage processes, ameliorate colitis, 'reset' the gene expression network from disease to health. Predictions were validated using a balanced and potent PPAR alpha/gamma-dual-agonist (PAR5359) in Citrobacter rodentium- and DSS-induced murine colitis models. Using inhibitors and agonists, we show that balanced-dual agonism promotes bacterial clearance efficiently than individual agonists, both in vivo and in vitro. PPAR alpha is required and sufficient to induce the pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular ROS, which are essential for bacterial clearance and immunity, whereas PPAR gamma-agonism blunts these responses, delays microbial clearance; balanced dual agonism achieved controlled inflammation while protecting the gut barrier and 'reversal' of the transcriptomic network. Furthermore, dual agonism reversed the defective bacterial clearance observed in PBMCs derived from IBD patients. These findings not only deliver a macrophage modulator for use as barrier-protective therapy in IBD, but also highlight the potential of BoNE to rationalize combination therapy. A Boolean network explorer (BoNE) computational algorithm was used to identify a dual agonist of the nuclear receptors PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma that may be therapeutic in treating inflammatory bowel disease.},

  abstract = {Objective: The study objective was to generate a prediction model for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) using machine learning featuring a large set of 47 clinical and sociodemographic predictors of treatment outcome. Method: 552 Patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) according to DSM-IV criteria were enrolled between 2011 and 2016. TRD was defined as failure to reach response to antidepressant treatment, characterized by a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score below 22 after at least 2 antidepressant trials of adequate length and dosage were administered. RandomForest (RF) was used for predicting treatment outcome phenotypes in a 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The full model with 47 predictors yielded an accuracy of 75.0\%. When the number of predictors was reduced to 15, accuracies between 67.6\% and 71.0\% were attained for different test sets. The most informative predictors of treatment outcome were baseline MADRS score for the current episode; impairment of family, social, and work life; the timespan between first and last depressive episode; severity; suicidal risk; age; body mass index; and the number of lifetime depressive episodes as well as lifetime duration of hospitalization. Conclusions: With the application of the machine learning algorithm RF, an efficient prediction model with an accuracy of 75.0\% for forecasting treatment outcome could be generated, thus surpassing the predictive capabilities of clinical evaluation. We also supply a simplified algorithm of 15 easily collected clinical and sociodemographic predictors that can be obtained within approximately 10 minutes, which reached an accuracy of 70.6\%. Thus, we are confident that our model will be validated within other samples to advance an accurate prediction model fit for clinical usage in TRD.},

Material(s) and Method(s): We developed a unifying mission and vision, established multidisciplinary governance, and formulated a strategic plan. Key elements of our strategy include establishing a world-class team; creating shared infrastructure to support individual innovations; developing and implementing innovations with high anticipated impact and a clear path to adoption; incorporating best practices such as the use of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and related interoperability standards; and maximizing synergies across research and operations and with partner organizations. Result(s): University of Utah Health launched the ReImagine EHR initiative in 2016. Supportive infrastructure developed by the initiative include various FHIR-related tooling and a systematic evaluation framework. More than 10 EHR-integrated digital innovations have been implemented to support preventive care, shared decision-making, chronic disease management, and acute clinical care. Initial evaluations of these innovations have demonstrated positive impact on user satisfaction, provider efficiency, and compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Return on investment has included improvements in care; over \$35 million in external grant funding; commercial opportunities; and increased ability to adapt to a changing healthcare landscape. Discussion(s): Key lessons learned include the value of investing in digital innovation initiatives leveraging FHIR; the importance of supportive infrastructure for accelerating innovation; and the critical role of user-centered design, implementation science, and evaluation. Conclusion(s): EHR-integrated digital innovation initiatives can be key assets for enhancing the EHR user experience, improving patient care, and reducing provider burnout.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The scope of this research is the application of expert system which is considered as a sub-branch of the artificial intelligence systems. In order to achieve this objective, the fracture mechanics of concrete is selected as the application field. With the purpose of determining the fractural behaviour of concrete, various test methods have been developed over the years. However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the circumstances of the laboratory environment and the required level of information; selection of the most appropriate method could sometimes be a very difficult task. For overcoming this bottleneck as well as to enhance the knowledge of the supervisory staff, an expert-system on the fracture mechanics of concrete has been developed within the context of this paper. The knowledge contained within this expert system has been acquired through an extensive review of the available technical literature and with the information complied, more than a hundred rules were developed. Finally, via the usage of this expert system, the most appropriate testing procedure on the fracture mechanics of concrete has been identified and also further advice related to the subject is supplied to the researcher.},

AT is appropriate in the context of this study, as it shows how contradictions act as a motor for change and lead to transformational changes, rather than viewing tensions as a threat to prematurely abandon the adoption and implementation of AI in B2B marketing. Based on eighteen interviews with industry and academic experts, the study identifies contradictions with which marketing researchers and practitioners must contend.

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.                                         Main body               Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.                                         Conclusion               The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

  abstract = {Study question: Does the morphodynamic data in preimplantation human embryo videos can be analyzed using deep learning algorithms to predict the potential to reach blatulation and implantation. Summary answer: Blastulation prediction on test-set embryos, reached area under the ROC curve 0.73 at 72 hour. prediction on of day-5 transferred test-set embryos, outperformed manual KIDScoreTM-D5. What is known already: In IVF treatments, early identification of embryos with high implantation potential is required for shortening time to pregnancy while avoiding clinical complications caused by multiple embryo pregnancy. Current classification tools are based on manually annotated morphological and morphokinetic parameters. However, manual annotation introduces inter-observer and intra-observer variability and provides a discrete representation of preimplantation development while ignoring dynamic features that may be associated with embryo quality. Deep learning AI, which offers a powerful toolbox for carrying out automated and standardized classification tasks involving expansive datasets, is gradually incorporated into the health care system worldwide and IVF clinics specifically. Study design, size, duration: 16,000 3D videos of preimplantation embryos were annotated for morphological and morphokinetic parameters. 6,200 were blastulation-labelled and {$>$} 5,500 were implantation-labelled. Each embryo video file was associated with maternal information and clinical metadata. The classification was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation and using an uncontaminated test set consisting of 20\% of the labeled embryos. Generality was verified via leave-one-clinic-out and leave-one-age-group out cross-validation. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Embryos were cultured in nine time-lapse incubators during the past six years in four medical centers across Israel. We developed fully automated and standardized classifiers by training time point sensitive deep neural networks directly on video frames. Using machine learning we combined the frame scores into a single embryo score for blastulation or implantation prediction. Using SHAP values we identified key time points for prediction and impactful video frames. Main results and the role of chance: Blastulation prediction on test set embryos increased monotonically with the time of prediction measured from ICSI, reaching area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.73 at 72 hours, 0.88 at 96 hours and 0.94 at 110 hours. Blastulation prediction was further demonstrated using high-quality embryos that reached 8 cells. KID predictive strength increased with time of prediction as evaluated for the same cohort of day-5 transferred test-set embryos. AUC increases slowly from 48 to 84 hours and more rapidly from 84 hours onward. Our deep learning prediction is as accurate as KIDScore-D3 on day-3 and more accurate than KIDScore-D5 on day-5 as evaluated for the same test-set embryos. Both blastulation and implantation results were consistent with fivefold cross-validation, leave one-clinic-out and leave one-age-group out from the training session, supporting generality. Using SHAP analysis we identified key temporal points that can direct blastulation and implantation prediction without including the rest of the video. we trained again the embryo-learning blastulation and implantation classifiers using only the key temporal points. The new models reached comparable AUC for both goals supporting the importance of a few time points. Limitations, reasons for caution: Prediction accuracy is limited due to lacking critical information about endometrial receptivity and using a homogenous dataset of embryos that were retrospectively preselected for transfer according to established morphological and/or morphokientic criteria. Wider implications of the findings: Deep learning provides full automation and standardization of embryo classification and improves accuracy. Our classifiers mark the first step towards the development of a decision support tool. This framework opens the door for clinical implementation of deep learning classification tools that will improve conception rates while shortening time to pregnancy.},

  abstract = {A foundational question for the discipline of psychiatry is the nature of psychiatric disorders. What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two “flavors” of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness.},

Here, we investigate if there is prospective evidence for biomarkers derived from leading theories. We focus on neuroimaging, gastrointestinal factors, immunology, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and oxidative stress. Searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo for articles published up to 06/2019. References and citations of included articles were screened to identify additional articles. Inclusion criteria were having an MDD diagnosis as outcome, a biomarker as predictor, and prospective design search terms were formulated accordingly. PRISMA guidelines were applied. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effect model when three or more comparable studies were identified, using a random effect model. Our search resulted in 67,464 articles, of which 75 prospective articles were identified on: Neuroimaging (N\,=\,24), Gastrointestinal factors (N\,=\,1), Immunology (N\,=\,8), Neurotrophic (N\,=\,2), Neurotransmitters (N\,=\,1), Hormones (N\,=\,39), Oxidative stress (N\,=\,1). Meta-analyses on brain volumes and immunology markers were not significant. Only cortisol (N\,=\,19, OR\,=\,1.294, p\,=\,0.024) showed a predictive effect on onset/relapse/recurrence of MDD, but not on time until MDD onset/relapse/recurrence. However, this effect disappeared when studies including participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis were removed from the analyses. Other studies were too heterogeneous to compare. Thus, there is a lack of evidence for leading biological theories for onset and maintenance of depression. Only cortisol was identified as potential predictor for MDD, but results are influenced by the disease state. High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.},

Initial analyses are reported here., METHODS: A penalized logistic regression model was compared with an earlier proof-of-concept logistic model. Exploratory analyses then considered commonly-used machine learning algorithms. Analyses were based on electronic medical records for all 6,360 individuals classified in the National Death Index as having died by suicide in fiscal years 2009-2011 who used VHA services the year of their death or prior year and a 1\% probability sample of time-matched VHA service users alive at the index date (n = 2,112,008)., RESULTS: A penalized logistic model with 61 predictors had sensitivity comparable to the proof-of-concept model (which had 381 predictors) at target thresholds. The machine learning algorithms had relatively similar sensitivities, the highest being for Bayesian additive regression trees, with 10.7\% of suicides occurred among the 1.0\% of Veterans with highest predicted risk and 28.1\% among the 5.0\% of with highest predicted risk., CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, VHA is using penalized logistic regression in initial intervention implementation. The paper concludes with a discussion of other practical issues that might be explored to increase model performance. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The survival rate from pancreatic cancer is very poor so prevention and early detection approaches are important. It is estimated that 37\% of pancreatic cancer cases can be prevented. Despite advanced knowledge on risk factors, prevention by personalized approach remain to be explored. The iHelp platform is being developed based on combining people's risk factors and can be used as a tool to help people develop new health habits. Study aim: To further develop and evaluate the i-Help risk assessment and support platform that utilizes big data management and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to establish person-centric early risk prediction, prevention, and intervention measures. Study design: The iHelp platform is an AI-based Scalable Big Data Platform which provides the necessary performance and features for the management and analysis of the heterogeneous data. The data source are derived from various sources including patients' historical medical data as well as self-reported lifestyle habits and behaviors, social media interactions, integrated in the form of a Holistic Health Record (HHRs). Through the utilization of the iHelp platform we are implementing innovative AI algorithms and techniques to accomplish multi-modal causal analysis, real-time anomaly detection to estimate risk prediction, forecasting of risk trajectories, and detection of suggested behavioral changes. AI techniques will draw adaptive learning models that provide the decision support based on the risk predictions as well as personalized prevention and intervention measures. Users of the platform are supported to make appropriate lifestyle changes and monitored by using mobile or wearable devices. Result(s): We will present the design of the platform together with feedback from end users on key modules. Ultimately we propose that the outcomes of iHelp components will not only integrate data from multiple sources, but they will also provide informative and motivational individualized pancreatic cancer risk reduction recommendations.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are an integral component of today’s health information technologies. They assist with interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment. A CDSS can be embedded throughout the patient safety continuum providing reminders, recommendations, and alerts to health care providers. Although CDSSs have been shown to reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes, they have fallen short of their full potential. User acceptance has been identified as one of the potential reasons for this shortfall. Objective: The purpose of this paper was to conduct a critical review and task analysis of CDSS research and to develop a new framework for CDSS design in order to achieve user acceptance. Methods: A critical review of CDSS papers was conducted with a focus on user acceptance. To gain a greater understanding of the problems associated with CDSS acceptance, we conducted a task analysis to identify and describe the goals, user input, system output, knowledge requirements, and constraints from two different perspectives: the machine (ie, the CDSS engine) and the user (ie, the physician). Results: Favorability of CDSSs was based on user acceptance of clinical guidelines, reminders, alerts, and diagnostic suggestions. We propose two models: (1) the user acceptance and system adaptation design model, which includes optimizing CDSS design based on user needs/expectations, and (2) the input-process-output-engagemodel, which reveals to users the processes that govern CDSS outputs. Conclusions: This research demonstrates that the incorporation of the proposed models will improve user acceptance to support the beneficial effects of CDSSs adoption. Ultimately, if a user does not accept technology, this not only poses a threat to the use of the technology but can also pose a threat to the health and well-being of patients.},

Thus, it's very difficult for individuals to conclude that they can fully understand it. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of dental students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia towards (AI). Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire sent to dental students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire used in this study was Google Forms. Furthermore, it was developed after referring a pre-validated questionnaire and distributed to students through social media platforms. The data collection was after 3 weeks. Results: Out of 423 participants, 50.1\% had no basic knowledge about the working principle of AI. Also, the majority was not aware of the usage of AI in dentistry (55.8\% No). The students get their knowledge about AI from social media and it was the most chosen answer by 40.9\% (n=324). When questioned about whether AI applications should be part of undergraduate or postgraduate dental training, the agreement response was higher in postgraduate training (48.9\%; n=207) compared to the undergraduate training (40.4\%; n=171). Conclusion: Despite the fact that the knowledge of AI among dental students was considered to be low, dental students were enthusiastic to learn more about new technologies related to dentistry. Also, participants believed that AI will play a vast role in dentistry. In order to improve the dental students' knowledge about AI, lectures, curricular courses, and scientific meetings should be highly considered.},

An American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology Health Information Technology and Education subcommittee workgroup was convened to perform a scoping review of AI within health care as well as the specialty of allergy and immunology to address impacts on allergy and immunology practice and research as well as potential challenges including education, AI governance, ethical and equity considerations, and potential opportunities for the specialty. There are numerous potential clinical applications of AI in allergy and immunology that range from disease diagnosis to multidimensional data reduction in electronic health records or immunologic datasets. For appropriate application and interpretation of AI, specialists should be involved in the design, validation, and implementation of AI in allergy and immunology. Challenges include incorporation of data science and bioinformatics into training of future allergists-immunologists.

  abstract = {As benign tumors, warts are made through the mediation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and may grow on all parts of body, especially hands and feet. There are several treatment methods for this illness. However, none of them can heal all patients. Consequently, physicians are looking for more effective and customized treatments for each patient. They are endeavoring to discover which treatments have better impacts on a particular patient. The aim of this study is to identify the appropriate treatment for two common types of warts (plantar and common) and to predict the responses of two of the best methods (immunotherapy and cryotherapy) to the treatment. As an original work, the study was conducted on 180 patients, with plantar and common warts, who had referred to the dermatology clinic of Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. In this study, 90 patients were treated by cryotherapy method with liquid nitrogen and 90 patients with immunotherapy method. The selection of the treatment method was made randomly. A fuzzy logic rule-based system was proposed and implemented to predict the responses to the treatment method. It was observed that the prediction accuracy of immunotherapy and cryotherapy methods was 83.33\% and 80.7\%, respectively. According to the results obtained, the benefits of this expert system are multifold: assisting physicians in selecting the best treatment method, saving time for patients, reducing the treatment cost, and improving the quality of treatment.

  abstract = {Background: The use of machine learning models to discriminate between patterns of neural activity has become in recent years a standard analysis approach in neuroimaging studies. Whenever these models are linear, the estimated parameters can be visualized in the form of brain maps which can aid in understanding how brain activity in space and time underlies a cognitive function. However, the recovered brain maps often suffer from lack of interpretability, especially in group analysis of multi-subject data. New method: To facilitate the application of brain decoding in group-level analysis, we present an application of multi-task joint feature learning for group-level multivariate pattern recovery in single-trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding. The proposed method allows for recovering sparse yet consistent patterns across different subjects, and therefore enhances the interpretability of the decoding model. Results: Our experimental results demonstrate that the mutli-task joint feature learning framework is capable of recovering more meaningful patterns of varying spatio-temporally distributed brain activity across individuals while still maintaining excellent generalization performance. Comparison with existing methods: We compare the performance of the multi-task joint feature learning in terms of generalization, reproducibility, and quality of pattern recovery against traditional single-subject and pooling approaches on both simulated and real MEG datasets. Conclusions: These results can facilitate the usage of brain decoding for the characterization of fine level distinctive patterns in group-level inference. Considering the importance of group-level analysis, the proposed approach can provide a methodological shift towards more interpretable brain decoding models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we also investigate the attitude toward IRAs and IRA value that influence the intention to use IRAs. AI powered recommendation agents have achieved noticeable outcomes in the contactless era by boosting revenues and customer value. On the Stitch Fix platform, an online personal styling service platform, AI-driven IRAs provide personalized recommendations to customers encompassing fashion styling and product design. In this study that considers the Stitch Fix context, a successful case of AI-driven IRAs, a survey was used to investigate key questions about the relationships among goals, IRA value, attitude, and intention to use AI-driven IRAs on the Stitch Fix platform. The participants were 321 AI-driven IRA users from South Korea recruited by a professional survey company. In conclusion, the study clarifies the relationship between personal hedonic goals and attitude and the value of IRAs, and the effects of these goals that ultimately influence the intention to use IRAs. The findings offer practical implications for IRAs that can be used to help consumers search and choose products. IRAs can be particularly helpful for engaging consumers with hedonic goals, stimulation, and comfort, especially consumers who seek comfort, as they are more likely to show a positive attitude and value IRAs, which could encourage behavior adherence. Advertising practitioners should target consumers who seek comfort to enhance personalized recommendation strategies via AI-driven IRAs. As IRAs proliferate in the advertising field, the findings offer implications that can enable advertisers and advertising academics and practitioners to better targeted audiences and enhance customer relationships.},

In this paper, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) to prediction of dementia using health behavior and medical service usage data, using data from 7031 subjects aged over 65 collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in 2001 and 2005. In the proposed model, principal component analysis (PCA) featuring and min/max scaling are used to preprocess and extract relevant background features. We compared our proposed methodology, a DNN/scaled PCA, with five well-known machine learning algorithms. The proposed methodology shows 85.5\% of the area under the curve (AUC), a better result than that using other algorithms. The proposed early prescreening method for possible dementia can be used by both patients and doctors.},

  abstract = {Mood disorders are a highly prevalent group of mental disorders causing substantial socioeconomic burden. There are various methodological approaches for identifying the underlying mechanisms of the etiology, symptomatology, and therapeutics of mood disorders; however, neuroimaging studies have provided the most direct evidence for mood disorder neural substrates by visualizing the brains of living individuals. The prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, ventral striatum, and corpus callosum are associated with depression and bipolar disorder. Identifying the distinct and common contributions of these anatomical regions to depression and bipolar disorder have broadened and deepened our understanding of mood disorders. However, the extent to which neuroimaging research findings contribute to clinical practice in the real-world setting is unclear. As traditional or non-machine learning MRI studies have analyzed group-level differences, it is not possible to directly translate findings from research to clinical practice; the knowledge gained pertains to the disorder, but not to individuals. On the other hand, a machine learning approach makes it possible to provide individual-level classifications. For the past two decades, many studies have reported on the classification accuracy of machine learning-based neuroimaging studies from the perspective of diagnosis and treatment response. However, for the application of a machine learning-based brain MRI approach in real world clinical settings, several major issues should be considered. Secondary changes due to illness duration and medication, clinical subtypes and heterogeneity, comorbidities, and cost-effectiveness restrict the generalization of the current machine learning findings. Sophisticated classification of clinical and diagnostic subtypes is needed. Additionally, as the approach is inevitably limited by sample size, multi-site participation and data-sharing are needed in the future.},

The heterogeneity of depressive syndrome has been criticized using the concept of language game in Wittgensteinian philosophy. Moreover, “a symptom- or endophenotype-based approach, rather than a diagnosis-based approach, has been proposed” as the “next-generation treatment for mental disorders” by Thomas Insel. Understanding the heterogeneity renders promise for personalized medicine to treat cases of depressive syndrome, in terms of both defining symptom clusters and selecting antidepressants. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as a tool for personalized medicine by handling clinical big data that can be used as predictors for subtype classification and treatment outcome prediction. The large clinical cohort data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcome (CO-MED), and the German Research Network on Depression (GRND) have recently began to be acknowledged as useful sources for machine learning-based depression research with regard to cost effectiveness and generalizability. In addition, noninvasive biological tools such as functional and resting state magnetic resonance imaging techniques are widely combined with machine learning methods to detect intrinsic endophenotypes of depression. This review highlights recent studies that have used clinical cohort or brain imaging data and have addressed machine learning-based approaches to defining symptom clusters and selecting antidepressants. Potentially applicable suggestions to realize machine learning-based personalized medicine for depressive syndrome are also provided herein.},

The number and list of colors used, the area of each color painted, the blend of colors, etc., are common elements rated in the evaluation of art. The main color in a drawing is also a major concern in evaluation. This paper delineates the development of a computer system that judges the main color in a drawing by applying the methods available in the field of digital image processing. Often, the main color is a different one from the color with the largest area painted, which is usually a background color. The system devises an algorithm, a kind of artificial intelligence function, to judge the main color as human experts do based on the characteristics, number of pixels, and number of clusters in a drawing. The proposed system is verified through case studies, by comparing the judgments by the computer with those by the human raters. It can contribute to the quantification and objectification of human decisions, as well as reducing the time and effort of human raters, and can therefore be a useful tool and an aid for human experts in making decisions in art therapy.},

As funding agencies understandably tend to err on the side of caution, and knowledge-based systems are still (despite an almost 40 year history) seen as a new and untried technology, few have been implemented. Of those which have, most are inappropriately simple and thus do not fit in with the real-life clinical environment. In contrast to the sophisticated systems in use in developed countries which reflect a mature technology, the use of knowledge-based systems in medicine in developing countries has primarily revolved around simple 'expert' systems, where the program functions more as a 'guru' than as a support function. We propose the more appropriate use of these systems as educational tools in medicine. In this discussion paper we describe a multi-level programme to support medical education, focusing on patient information systems involving natural language generation, decision-support systems as educational aids for primary health-care workers and model-based reasoning tools which allow exploratory learning for physicians in training.

With advances in technology, there is an opportunity to research the utility of a telemedicine-based control center for anesthesia clinicians that assess risk, diagnoses negative patient trajectories, and implements evidence-based practices. Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether an anesthesiology control tower (ACT) prevents clinically relevant adverse postoperative outcomes including 30-day mortality, delirium, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. Secondary objectives are to determine whether the ACT improves perioperative quality of care metrics including management of temperature, mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure with mechanical ventilation, blood glucose, anesthetic concentration, antibiotic redosing, and efficient fresh gas flow. Methods and analysis: We are conducting a single center, randomized, controlled, phase 3 pragmatic clinical trial. A total of 58 operating rooms are randomized daily to receive support from the ACT or not. All adults (eighteen years and older) undergoing surgical procedures in these operating rooms are included and followed until 30 days after their surgery. Clinicians in operating rooms randomized to ACT support receive decision support from clinicians in the ACT. In operating rooms randomized to no intervention, the current standard of anesthesia care is delivered. The intention-to-treat principle will be followed for all analyses. Differences between groups will be presented with 99\% confidence intervals; p-values {$<$}0.005 will be reported as providing compelling evidence, and p-values between 0.05 and 0.005 will be reported as providing suggestive evidence.

  abstract = {Background: Digitalization is a disruptive technology that changes the way we deliver diagnostic procedures and treatments in medicine. Different stakeholders have varying interests in and expectations of the digitalization of modern medicine. Many recent digital advances in the medical field, such as the implementation of electronic health records, telemedical services, and mobile health apps, are increasingly used by medical professionals and patients. During the current pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus-caused respiratory disease (COVID-19), many modern information and communication technologies (ICT) have been used to overcome the physical barriers and limitations caused by government-issued curfews and workforce shortages. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the usage of modern ICT in medicine. At the same time, the eHealth literacy of physicians working with these technologies has probably not improved since our study. Objective: This paper describes a representative cohort of German physicians before the COVID-19 pandemic and their eHealth literacy and attitude towards modern ICT. Methods: A structured, self-developed questionnaire about user behavior and attitudes towards eHealth applications was administered to a representative cohort of 93 German physicians. Results: Of the 93 German physicians who participated in the study, 97\% (90/93) use a mobile phone. Medical apps are used by 42\% (39/93). Half of the surveyed physicians (47/93, 50\%) use their private mobile phones for official purposes on a daily basis. Telemedicine is part of the daily routine for more than one-third (31/93, 33\%) of all participants. More than 80\% (76/93, 82\%) of the trial participants state that their knowledge regarding the legal aspects and data safety of medical apps and cloud computing is insufficient. Conclusions: Modern ICT is frequently used and mostly welcomed by German physicians. However, there is a tremendous lack of eHealth literacy and knowledge about the safe and secure implementation of these technologies in routine clinical practice.},

Research on machine learning as a technique for identifying individuals at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death has grown rapidly. This research often places great emphasis on the promise of machine learning for preventing suicide, but overlooks the practical, clinical implementation issues that might preclude delivering on such a promise. In this Review, we synthesise the broad empirical and review literature on electronic health record-based machine learning in suicide research, and focus on matters of crucial importance for implementation of machine learning in clinical practice. The challenge of preventing statistically rare outcomes is well known; progress requires tackling data quality, transparency, and ethical issues. In the future, machine learning models might be explored as methods to enable targeting of interventions to specific individuals depending upon their level of need-ie, for precision medicine. Primarily, however, the promise of machine learning for suicide prevention is limited by the scarcity of high-quality scalable interventions available to individuals identified by machine learning as being at risk of suicide.

  abstract = {In ever more pressured health-care systems, technological solutions offering scalability of care and better resource targeting are appealing. Research on machine learning as a technique for identifying individuals at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death has grown rapidly. This research often places great emphasis on the promise of machine learning for preventing suicide, but overlooks the practical, clinical implementation issues that might preclude delivering on such a promise. In this Review, we synthesise the broad empirical and review literature on electronic health record-based machine learning in suicide research, and focus on matters of crucial importance for implementation of machine learning in clinical practice. The challenge of preventing statistically rare outcomes is well known; progress requires tackling data quality, transparency, and ethical issues. In the future, machine learning models might be explored as methods to enable targeting of interventions to specific individuals depending upon their level of need-ie, for precision medicine. Primarily, however, the promise of machine learning for suicide prevention is limited by the scarcity of high-quality scalable interventions available to individuals identified by machine learning as being at risk of suicide.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we aimed to develop a novel prediction model to identify patients in need of a non-contrast head CT exam during emergency department (ED) triage. Method(s): We collected data of all adult ED visits in our institution for five consecutive years (1/2013-12/2017). Retrieved variables included the following: demographics, mode of arrival to the ED, comorbidities, home medications, structured and unstructured chief complaints, vital signs, pain scale score, emergency severity index, ED wing assignment, documentation of previous ED visits, hospitalizations and CTs, and current visit non-contrast head CT usage. A machine learning gradient boosting model was trained on data from the years 2013-2016 and tested on data from 2017. Area under the curve (AUC) was used as metrics. Single-variable AUCs were also determined. Youden's index evaluated optimal sensitivity and specificity of the models. Result(s): The final cohort included 595,561 ED visits. Non-contrast head CT usage rate was 11.8\%. Each visit was coded into an input vector of 171 variables. Single-variable analysis showed that chief complaint had the best single predictive analysis (AUC = 0.87). The best model showed an AUC of 0.93 (95\% CI 0.931-0.936) for predicting non-contrast head CT usage at triage level. The model had a sensitivity of 88.1\% and specificity of 85.7\% for non-contrast head CT utilization. Conclusion(s): The developed model can identify patients that need to undergo head CT exam already in the ED triage level and by that allow faster diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Objective: Reducing care variability through guidelines has significantly benefited patients. Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop and evaluate a complementary approach - using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which describes a healthcare system that learns from itself. Material(s) and Method(s): We used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining approach. Result(s): A short order menu on average contained the next order (weighted average length 3.91-5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good: average AUC above 0.9 for 25\% of order types and overall average AUC .714-.844 (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50-.99). Higher AUC correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent. Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to enhance decision support.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Pubmed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Association of Computing Machinery digital library and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2000 to December 2019. Included studies evaluated the impact of higher level CDSSs on process outcomes, guideline adherence and clinical outcomes. Result(s): 11,397 studies were selected for screening, after which 61 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, nine studies were included in the final analysis with a total population size of 7985 patients. Types of cancer included breast cancer (63.1\%), lung cancer (27.8\%), prostate cancer (4.1\%), colorectal cancer (3.1\%) and other cancer types (1.9\%). The included studies demonstrated significant improvements of higher level CDSSs on process outcomes and guideline adherence across diverse settings in oncology. No significant differences were reported for clinical outcomes. Conclusion(s): Higher level CDSSs seem to improve process outcomes and guidelines adherence but not clinical outcomes. It should be noticed that the included studies primarily focused on breast and lung cancer.

These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88\%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22\%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43\%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44\%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Rheport is an online rheumatology referral system allowing automatic appointment triaging of new rheumatology patient referrals according to the respective probability of an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD). Previous research reported that Rheport was well accepted among IRD patients. Its accuracy was, however, limited, currently being based on an expert-based weighted sum score. This study aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) models could improve this limited accuracy. Material(s) and Method(s): Data from a national rheumatology registry (RHADAR) was used to train and test nine different ML models to correctly classify IRD patients. Diagnostic performance was compared of ML models and the current algorithm was compared using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Feature importance was investigated using shapley additive explanation (SHAP). Result(s): A complete data set of 2265 patients was used to train and test ML models. 30.5\% of patients were diagnosed with an IRD, 69.3\% were female. The diagnostic accuracy of the current Rheport algorithm (AUROC of 0.534) could be improved with all ML models, (AUROC ranging between 0.630 and 0.737). Targeting a sensitivity of 90\%, the logistic regression model could double current specificity (17\% vs. 33\%). Finger joint pain, inflammatory marker levels, psoriasis, symptom duration and female sex were the five most important features of the best performing logistic regression model for IRD classification. Conclusion(s): In summary, ML could improve the accuracy of a currently used rheumatology online referral system. Including further laboratory parameters and enabling individual feature importance adaption could increase accuracy and lead to broader usage.Copyright © 2022 Knitza, Janousek, Kluge, von der Decken, Kleinert, Vorbruggen, Kleyer, Simon, Hueber, Muehlensiepen, Vuillerme, Schett, Eskofier, Welcker and Bartz-Bazzanella.},

  abstract = {Background: Surgical procedures account for 50\% of hospital revenue and w60\% of operating costs. On average, {$<$}20\% of surgical instruments will be used during a case, and the expense for resterilization and assembly of instrument trays ranges from \$0.51 to \$ 3.01 per instrument. Given the complexity of the surgical service supply chain, physician preferences, and variation of procedures, a reduction of surgical cost has been extremely difficult and often ill-defined. A data-driven approach to instrument tray optimization has implications for efficiency and cost savings in sterile processing, including reductions in tray assembly time and instrument repurchase, repair, and avoidable depreciation. Methods: During a 3-month period, vascular surgery cases were monitored using a cloud-based technology product (OpFlow, Operative Flow Technologies, Raleigh, NC) as a part of a hospital-wide project. Given the diversity of the cases evaluated, we focused on two main vascular surgery trays: vascular and aortic. An assessment was performed to evaluate the exact instruments used by the operating surgeons across a variety of cases. The vascular tray contained 131 instruments and was used for the vast majority of vascular cases, and the aortic tray contained 152 instruments. Actual instrument usage data were collected, a review and analysis performed, and the trays optimized. Results: During the 3-month period, 168 vascular surgery cases were evaluated across six surgeons. On average, the instrument usage per tray was 30 of 131 instruments (22.9\%) for the vascular tray and 19 of 152 (12.5\%) for the aortic tray. After review, 45.8\% of the instruments were removed from the vascular tray and 62.5\% from the aortic tray, for 1255 instruments removed from the versions of both trays. An audit was performed after the removal of instruments, which showed that none of the removed instruments had required reinstatement. The instrument reduction from these two trays alone yielded an estimated costs savings of \$97,781 for repurchase and \$97,444 in annual resterilization savings. Annually, the removal of the instruments is projected to save 316.2 hours of personnel time. The time required for operating room table setup decreased from amean of 7:44 to 5:02 minutes for the vascular tray ( P {$<$}.0001) and from 8:53 to 4:56 minutes for the aortic tray ( P {$<$}.0001). Conclusions: Given increasing cost constraints in healthcare, sterile processing remains an untapped resource for surgical expense reduction. A comprehensive data analytics solution provided the ability to make informed decisions in tray management that otherwise could not be reliably performed.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals1, but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients1,2. To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, I used reinforcement learning, a class of machine learning algorithms whose goal is to estimate an optimal set of rules that maximises some form of reward.3 Similarly, a clinician's goal is to make therapeutic decisions in order to maximize a patient's probability of a good outcome. An artificial intelligence (AI) agent was built and validated on two large non-overlapping ICU databases, containing data routinely collected from adult patients in the U.S.A. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III (MIMIC-III) was used for model development and the eICU Research Institute Database (eRI) for model testing. All patients included fulfilled the sepsis-3 criteria. The final datasets contain 17,083 admissions from MIMIC-III from 5 separate ICUs in one hospital and 79,073 admissions from 128 different hospitals from eRI. I extracted up to 72 hours of data per patient, in the form of time series of 48 variables, including demographics, Elixhauser premorbid status, vital signs, laboratory values, fluids and vasopressors received. A Markov decision process (MDP) was used to model the patient environment and trajectories. 3 The various elements of the model were defined using patient data time series from the training set (Figure 1). I deployed the AI agent to solve the MDP and predict outcomes of treatment strategies. First, I evaluated the actual treatments of clinicians, by analysing all the prescriptions and computing the average return of each treatment option, which can take values from-100 to +100 in my model. Then, the MDP was solved using an algorithm called policy iteration, which identified the treatments that maximised return, that is, the expected 90-day survival of patients. 3 This process generated a new treatment strategy (termed "a policy" in reinforcement learning) for sepsis optimizing 90-day mortality, which could be applied in real-time at the patient level. Figure 1: Data flow of the AI agent. Eighty percent of the MIMIC-III dataset was used to define the elements of the Markov decision process. Time series of patient data were clustered into finite states. The dose of intravenous fluids and vasopressors were discretized into 25 possible actions. Patients' survival at 90 days after ICU admission defined rewards. Reinforcement learning was used to estimate optimal treatment strategies. The remaining 20\% MIMIC-III data was used to identify the best model among 500 candidates, which was then tested on an independent dataset from the eRI database. It was crucial to obtain reliable estimates of the performance of this new policy without deploying it, since executing a bad policy would be dangerous for patients3,4. In reinforcement learning, evaluating the performance of a new policy using trajectories generated by another policy (the clinicians' policy) is termed off-policy evaluation3,4. I implemented a type of off-policy evaluation called weighted importance sampling, and used bootstrapping to estimate the true distribution of the value of the AI policy.4 500 candidate models were built, and I selected the one maximising the theoretical statistical safety of the new AI policy. Then, the chosen AI policy was tested on the independent eRI dataset. Figure 2a shows the distribution of the estimated value of the clinicians' policy and the AI policy in the selected final model tested on the eRI cohort. The median value of the AI policy, at 84.5 (interquartile range 84.3-87.7), was reliably higher than that of clinicians' (median 56.9, interquartile range 54.7-58.8). Figures 2b and 2c show the distribution of treatment doses according to clinicians' and AI policies. On average, the AI agent recommended lower doses of intravenous fluids and higher doses of vasopressors, compared to clinicians' actual treatments. While the proportion of time the eRI patients received vasopressors was only 17\%, that would have been 30\% if following the AI agent. I analysed patient mortality when the dose actually administered corresponded to or differed from the dose suggested by the AI agent. The patients who received doses similar to the doses recommended by the AI agent had the lowest mortality. Giving more or less than the AI policy of either treatment was associated with increasing mortality rates, in a dose-dependent fashion (Figures 2d and 2e). When the actual dose given was different from the suggested dose, clinicians gave more or less fluids in similar proportions, and less vasopressors 75\% of the time. The median dose deficit in patients who received too little vasopressors was 0.13 mug/kg/min (interquartile range 0.04-0.27 mug/kg/min). Figure 2.

All actions were aggregated over all time steps for the 5 dose bins of both medications. On average, patients were administered more intravenous fluid (b) and less vasopressor (c) medications than recommended by the AI policy. Vasopressor dose is in mug/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent and intravenous fluids dose is in mL/4 hours. d and e, The dose excess refers to the difference between the given and suggested dose averaged over all time points per patient. The shaded area represents the standard error of the mean. In both plots, the smallest dose difference was associated with the best survival rates (vertical dotted line). The further away the dose received was from the suggested dose, the worse the outcome. In this research, I demonstrated how reinforcement learning could be applied to solve a complex medical problem, and suggest individualized treatment strategies for sepsis. When clinicians' actual treatments varied from the AI agent's suggested policy, this was most commonly to administer too little vasopressor. Early use of lowdose vasopressor has been suggested in sepsis2,5. This may avoid administering excessive amounts of fluids, which has been linked with poorer outcome2,5. My results support this strategy but importantly allow the treatment to be individualized for each patient. My vision is that this system will be used in real-time, using data streams in electronic health records to suggest a course of action. Physicians will always need to make subjective clinical judgments about treatment strategies, but computational models can provide additional insight about optimal decisions, avoiding targeting short-term resuscitation goals and instead following trajectories towards longer-term survival. There are limitations to this study. Although the datasets are large and used routinely collected clinical data, some sites and patients had to be excluded due to poor quality data recording or missing data. Due to differences between the two datasets, slightly different implementations of the sepsis-3 criteria were used, and hospital mortality was used in eRI instead of 90-day mortality. Finally, some laboratory values would not have been immediately available to clinicians to inform decision making but were available to the AI agent. This work will clearly require prospective evaluation using real-time data and in clinical trials, but if only a few percent reduction in mortality from sepsis could be achieved, this would represent several tens of thousands of lives saved annually, worldwide. In the last 10 to 15 years, attempts to develop novel treatments to reduce sepsis mortality have uniformly been unsuccessful2,5. The use of computer decision support systems to better guide treatments and improve outcomes is therefore a much-needed approach.

  abstract = {Purpose We study the inter-reader variability in manual delineation of cystic renal masses (CRMs) presented in computerized tomography (CT) images and its effect on the classification performance of a machine learning algorithm in distinguishing benign from potentially malignant CRMs. In addition, we assessed whether the inclusion of higher-order robust radiomic features improves the classification performance over the use of first-order features. Methods 230 CRMs were independently delineated by two radiologists. Through a combination of random fluctuations, dilation, and erosion operations over the original region of interests (ROIs), we generated four additional sets of synthetic ROIs to capture the inter-reader variability realistically, as confirmed by dice coefficient measurements and visual assessment. We then identified the robust features based on the intra-class coefficient (ICC {$>$} 0.85) across these datasets. We applied a tenfold stratified cross-validation (CV) to train and test the performance of the random forest model for the classification of CRMs into benign and potentially malignant. Results The mean area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.87, 0.82, 0.90, 0.85, and 0.93, respectively. With the usage of first-order features alone, the corresponding values were nearly identical. Conclusion AUC ranged for the robust and uncorrelated features from 0.83 +/- 0.09 to 0.93 +/- 0.04 and for the first-order features from 0.84 +/- 0.09 to 0.91 +/- 0.04. Our study indicates that the first-order features alone are sufficient for the classification of CRMs, and that inclusion of higher-order features does not necessarily improve performance.},

Objective(s): Implementation of a fuzzy-based clinical detection model for coronary risk prevention, which mainly comprises two main objectives: (1) designing weighted fuzzy standards, and (2) creating a fuzzy guidelines based choice supporting network. Method(s): In prior work, information was obtained from a supportive network which utilized learning from medical specialists, and ported this information into a PC processing queue. The entire process, however, is time consuming and tedious. Medical specialists reach conclusions based on manual observations, which can be inaccurate in some instances. To address this issue, machine learning procedures have been created to obtain information from patients. Result(s): and Conclusion(s): Herein, a fuzzy rule-based clinical system is described for the automatic detection of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). This was done by gathering information, implementing assessment procedures, and creating knowledge from patient clinical data.Copyright © 2019},

  abstract = {Background: Advances in precision medicine will require an increasingly individualized prognostic evaluation of patients in order to provide the patient with appropriate therapy. The traditional statistical methods of predictive modeling, such as SCORE, PROCAM, and Framingham, according to the European guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, not adapted for all patients and require significant human involvement in the selection of predictive variables, transformation and imputation of variables. In ROC-analysis for prediction of significant cardiovascular disease (CVD), the areas under the curve for Framingham: 0.62-0.72, for SCORE: 0.66-0.73 and for PROCAM: 0.60-0.69. To improve it, we apply for approaches to predict a CVD event rely on conventional risk factors by machine learning and deep learning models to 10-year CVD event prediction by using longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Method(s): For machine learning, we applied logistic regression (LR) and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units as a deep learning algorithm. We extract from longitudinal EHR the following features: demographic, vital signs, diagnoses (ICD-10-cm: I21-I22.9: I61- I63.9) and medication. The problem in this step, that near 80 percent of clinical information in EHR is "unstructured" and contains errors and typos. Missing data are important for the correct training process using by deep learning \& machine learning algorithm. The study cohort included patients between the ages of 21 to 75 with a dynamic observation window. In total, we got 31517 individuals in the dataset, but only 3652 individuals have all features or missing features values can be easy to impute. Among these 3652 individuals, 29.4\% has a CVD, mean age 49.4 years, 68,2\% female. Evaluation: We randomly divided the dataset into a training and a test set with an 80/20 split. The LR was implemented with Python Scikit-Learn and the LSTM model was implemented with Keras using Tensorflow as the backend. Result(s): We applied machine learning and deep learning models using the same features as traditional risk scale and longitudinal EHR features for CVD prediction, respectively. Machine learning model (LR) achieved an AUROC of 0.74-0.76 and deep learning (LSTM) 0.75-0.76. By using features from EHR logistic regression and deep learning models improved the AUROC to 0.78-0.79. Conclusion(s): The machine learning models outperformed a traditional clinically-used predictive model for CVD risk prediction (i.e. SCORE, PROCAM, and Framingham equations). This approach was used to create a clinical decision support system (CDSS). It uses both traditional risk scales and models based on neural networks. Especially important is the fact that the system can calculate the risks of cardiovascular disease automatically and recalculate immediately after adding new information to the EHR.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a near-real-time data warehouse (DW) in an academic ophthalmologic center to gain scientific use of increasing digital data from electronic medical records (EMR) and diagnostic devices., DESIGN: Database development., METHODS: Specific macular clinic user interfaces within the institutional hospital information system were created. Orders for imaging modalities were sent by an EMR-linked picture-archiving and communications system to the respective devices. All data of 325 767 patients since 2002 were gathered in a DW running on an SQL database. A data discovery tool was developed. An exemplary search for patients with age-related macular degeneration, performed cataract surgery, and at least 10 intravitreal (excluding bevacizumab) injections was conducted., RESULTS: Data related to those patients (3 142 204 diagnoses [including diagnoses from other fields of medicine], 720 721 procedures [eg, surgery], and 45 416 intravitreal injections) were stored, including 81 274 optical coherence tomography measurements. A web-based browsing tool was successfully developed for data visualization and filtering data by several linked criteria, for example, minimum number of intravitreal injections of a specific drug and visual acuity interval. The exemplary search identified 450 patients with 516 eyes meeting all criteria., CONCLUSIONS: A DW was successfully implemented in an ophthalmologic academic environment to support and facilitate research by using increasing EMR and measurement data. The identification of eligible patients for studies was simplified. In future, software for decision support can be developed based on the DW and its structured data. The improved classification of diseases and semiautomatic validation of data via machine learning are warranted. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem. CKD constitutes a complex disease due to differing underlying disease etiologies in each patient, which can in turn lead to many complications, comorbidities and polypharmacy. Monitoring disease progression and personalized treatment efforts are crucial for optimal long-term patient outcomes. In order to achieve this, physicians need to integrate different levels of data, e.g. clinical/demographic parameters, biomarkers and drug information, with medical knowledge. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can tackle these issues and improve patient management. 'CKDNapp' (CKD Nephrologist App), a CDSS application for nephrologists, based on mathematical models using machine-learning techniques, is currently being developed (https://ckdn.app). CKDNapp is intended to become a tool for daily clinical use. The nephrologists' attitude towards any CDSS and CKDNapp in particular is of prime importance for its successful implementation into the daily medical routine. This survey investigates nephrologists' experiences with CDSS in general and their expectations towards a reliable and useful application supporting their daily medical routine. METHOD(S): CKDNapp survey is ongoing and has been conducted by telephone or as a do-it-yourself online interview in the form of a 38-item questionnaire. The answers of nephrologists from all regions across Germany were collected and analyzed using the Electronic Data Capture System, RedCap [1]. CKDNapp survey is divided into four modules: (1) experiences with CDSS, (2) expectations of a helpful CDSS, (3) evaluation of the planned contents of CKDNapp and (4) ethical aspects of CDSS (in collaboration with the BMBF-funded DESIREE project; https://www.desiree-forschung.de/desiree/index.php). All questions were based on a literature search for questionnaire items on CDSS [2, 3]. Response formats include the Likert scale or multiple choice. Descriptive statistical analyses of all questions were calculated. RESULT(S): In total, 44 participants took the survey, and completeness of answers ranged from 85\% to 100\%. Participants were aged 51-60 years old, male (64\%) and had been working in nephrology outpatient clinics for a median of 12 years. Nephrologists treated a median of 35 patients/day. A total of 85\% of participants reported never or rarely use a CDSS in patient care. The most frequently given reason for this was a lack of knowledge about CDSS. Nevertheless, 79\% of participants believed CDSS to be helpful in the management of patients with CKD and 71\% would be willing to use a CDSS given the chance to do so. When rating the importance of planned CKDNapp features, prediction of CKD progression (97\%, Figure 1) and in-silico simulations of disease progression when changing, e.g. lifestyle or medication (97\%) were most important, followed by the need for integration of available CKD guidelines (95\%), prediction of acute kidney injury (95\%), prediction of mortality risk (80\%), and easy access to patient information (76\%). The spectrum of answers to ethical aspects of CDSS (utility of CDSS for experienced versus inexperienced nephrologists, aspects of machine learning Fig. 2, discrimination of minority groups, etc.) was diverse. CONCLUSION(S): This survey provides insights into experience with and expectations of outpatient nephrologists on CDSS in general and CKDNapp in particular. Despite the current lack of knowledge on CDSS, the willingness to integrate CDSS into daily patient care and the evaluation of planned CKDNapp features was high. (Figure Presented).},

The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved bibliographic records, which were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting of the IMIA editorial team finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews and the section editors' evaluation., RESULTS: Among 1,148 retrieved articles, 15 best paper candidates were selected, the review of which resulted in the selection of four best papers. The first paper introduces a deep learning model for estimating short-term life expectancy ({$>$}3 months) of metastatic cancer patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in electronic medical records, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. The second paper takes note that CDSSs become routinely integrated in health information systems and compares statistical anomaly detection models to identify CDSS malfunctions which, if remain unnoticed, may have a negative impact on care delivery. The third paper fairly reports on lessons learnt from the development of an oncology CDSS using artificial intelligence techniques and from its assessment in a large US cancer center. The fourth paper implements a preference learning methodology for detecting inconsistencies in clinical practice guidelines and illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology to antibiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: Three of the four best papers rely on data-driven methods, and one builds on a knowledge-based approach. While there is currently a trend for data-driven decision support, the promising results of such approaches still need to be confirmed by the adoption of these systems and their routine use.

  abstract = {Structural brain abnormalities are central to schizophrenia (SZ), but it remains unknown whether they are linked to dysmaturational processes crossing diagnostic boundaries, aggravating across disease stages, and driving the neurodiagnostic signature of the illness. Therefore, we investigated whether patients with SZ (N = 141), major depression (MD; N = 104), borderline personality disorder (BPD; N = 57), and individuals in at-risk mental states for psychosis (ARMS; N = 89) deviated from the trajectory of normal brain maturation. This deviation was measured as difference between chronological and the neuroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [BrainAGE]). Neuroanatomical age was determined by a machine learning system trained to individually estimate age from the structural magnetic resonance imagings of 800 healthy controls. Group-level analyses showed that BrainAGE was highest in SZ (+5.5 y) group, followed by MD (+4.0), BPD (+3.1), and the ARMS (+1.7) groups. Earlier disease onset in MD and BPD groups correlated with more pronounced BrainAGE, reaching effect sizes of the SZ group. Second, BrainAGE increased across at-risk, recent onset, and recurrent states of SZ. Finally, BrainAGE predicted both patient status as well as negative and disorganized symptoms. These findings suggest that an individually quantifiable “accelerated aging” effect may particularly impact on the neuroanatomical signature of SZ but may extend also to other mental disorders.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a conceptual framework for building practically applicable clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) using data-driven (DD) predictive modelling. With the proposed framework we have tried to fill the gap between experimental CDSS implementations widely covered in the literature and solutions acceptable by physicians in daily practice. The framework is based on a three-stage approach where DD model definition is accomplished with practical norms referencing (scales, clinical recommendations, etc.) and explanation of the prediction results and recommendations. The approach is aimed at increasing the applicability of CDSSs based on DD models through better integration into decision context and higher explainability. The approach has been implemented in software solutions and tested within a case study in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prediction, enabling us to improve known clinical scales (such as FINDRISK) while keeping the problem-specific reasoning interface similar to existing applications. A survey was performed to assess and investigate the acceptance level and provide insights on the influences of the introduced framework's element on physicians' behavior.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: Digital health apps are efficacious treatment options for mild-to-moderate depressive disorders. However, the extent to which psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial. Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions. Methods: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy–based intervention for depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1\%) completed the intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed significantly between groups at the postintervention (F2,398=37.20, P\&lt;.001). The reductions in scores for both guided and unguided intervention groups were greater than that for the control group, with large between-group effect sizes (guided vs control: d=1.63, 95\% CI 1.37 to 1.93; unguided vs control: d=1.47, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.73) at postintervention. No significant differences were found between guided and unguided intervention groups (P=.18). At follow-up (6 months), treatment effects on the primary outcome were maintained for both intervention groups (guided: F1,194=0.62, P\&gt;.999; unguided: F1,176=0.13, P\&gt;.999). Conclusions: Both guided and unguided versions of the intervention were highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Follow-up data suggest that these effects could be maintained. The guided version was not superior to the unguided version. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017191; https://tinyurl.com/2p9h5hnx},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Arden Syntax is a standard for representing and sharing medical knowledge in form of independent modules and looks back on a history of 25 years. Its traditional field of application is the monitoring of clinical events such as generating an alert in case of occurrence of a critical laboratory result. Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules must be able to retrieve patient data from the electronic medical record in order to enable automated decision making. For patient data with a simple structure, for instance a list of laboratory results, or, in a broader view, any patient data with a list or table structure, this mapping process is straightforward. Nevertheless, if patient data are of a complex nested structure the mapping process may become tedious. Two clinical requirements - to process complex microbiology data and to decrease the time between a critical laboratory event and its alerting by monitoring Health Level 7 (HL7) communication - have triggered the investigation of approaches for providing complex patient data from electronic medical records inside Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data mapping capabilities of current versions of the Arden Syntax standard as well as interfaces and data mapping capabilities of three different Arden Syntax environments have been analyzed. We found and implemented three different approaches to map a test sample of complex microbiology data for 22 patients and measured their execution times and memory usage. Based on one of these approaches, we mapped entire HL7 messages onto congruent Arden Syntax objects., RESULTS: While current versions of Arden Syntax support the mapping of list and table structures, complex data structures are so far unsupported. We identified three different approaches to map complex data from electronic patient records onto Arden Syntax variables; each of these approaches successfully mapped a test sample of complex microbiology data. The first approach was implemented in Arden Syntax itself, the second one inside the interface component of one of the investigated Arden Syntax environments. The third one was based on deserialization of Extended Markup Language (XML) data. Mean execution times of the approaches to map the test sample were 497ms, 382ms, and 84ms. Peak memory usage amounted to 3MB, 3MB, and 6MB., CONCLUSION: The most promising approach by far was to map arbitrary XML structures onto congruent complex data types of Arden Syntax through deserialization. This approach is generic insofar as a data mapper based on this approach can transform any patient data provided in appropriate XML format. Therefore it could help overcome a major obstacle for integrating clinical decision support functions into clinical information systems. Theoretically, the deserialization approach would even allow mapping entire patient records onto Arden Syntax objects in one single step. We recommend extending the Arden Syntax specification with an appropriate XML data format. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Major progress in understanding complex molecular mechanisms of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has led to a new, rapidly evolving treatment paradigm that is increasingly complex and patient-specific. This advent of precision medicine has not only significantly expanded the amount of clinical information in the diagnostic and treatment decision-making process, but also the granularity of medical evidence which needs to be considered. While artificial intelligence (AI) can be implemented to offer assistance to physicians during clinical reasoning and decision-making processes, those require prior formalization of domain-specific medical knowledge to deduce meaningful therapy suggestions. Method(s): To generate a holistic formal representation model of personalized treatment pathways in MDS, we first compiled all required individual parameters through extensive analysis of relevant clinical practice guidelines (e.g., Onkopedia, ESMO), clinical case documentation ({$>$}2000), and published evidence. We then semantically defined each parameter through mapping onto a corresponding SNOMED-CT or LOINC concept before its integration into a HL7 FHIR resource for interoperable storage. We subsequently modeled the interaction and dependency of individual parameters, which are essential for the personalized treatment decision process, into a causal graph-based network using the 'Resource Description Framework'. Result(s): Based on our intensive analysis to gather all information involved in the individual treatment decision process for MDS patients, we were able to identify and semantically describe a total of 303 individual parameters. Furthermore, a total of 2121 individual causal links between the parameters emerged, reflecting the immense complexity of the overarching decision problem. Conclusion(s): We developed a comprehensive, semantic and causal model of treatment decisions/pathways in MDS that provides us with an extensive formal representation of the actual knowledge-based process. In the following stages, this newly developed model will be used to integrate methods for automatic reasoning of the presented decision problems to computationally solve the inherent multi-factorial classification tasks. In this way, we aim to provide valid assistance for the complex cognitive processes needed for the development of a next-generation stratification and prognosis system and an AI-assisted clinical decision-support platform for MDS patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclusive digital health prioritizes public engagement through digital literacies and internet/web connectivity for advancing and scaling healthcare equitably by informatics technologies. This is badly needed, largely desirable and uncontroversial. However, historically, medical and healthcare practices and their informatics processes assume that individual clinical encounters between practitioners and patients are the indispensable foundation of clinical practice. This assumption has been dramatically challenged by expansion of digital technologies, their interconnectable mobility, virtuality, surveillance informatics, and the vastness of data repositories for individuals and populations that enable and support them. This article is a brief historical commentary emphasizing critical ethical issues about decisions in clinical interactions or encounters raised in the early days of the field. These questions, raised eloquently by Francois Gremy in 1985, have become urgently relevant to the equity/fairness, inclusivity and unbiasedness desired of today's pervasive digital health systems. OBJECTIVE(S): The main goal of this article is to highlight how the personal freedoms of choice, values, and responsibilities arising in relationships between physicians and healthcare practitioners and their patients in the clinical encounter can be distorted by digital health technologies which focus more on efficiency, productivity, and scalability of healthcare processes. Understanding the promise and limitations of early and current decision-support systems and the analytics of community or population data can help place into historical context the often exaggerated claims made today about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning "solving" clinical problems with algorithms and data, downplaying the role of the clinical judgments and responsibilities inherent in personal clinical encounters. METHOD(S): A review of selected early articles in medical informatics is related to current literature on the ethical issues and technological inadequacies involved in the design and implementation of clinical systems for decision-making. Early insights and cautions about the development of decision support technologies raised questions about the ethical responsibilities in clinical encounters where freedom of personal choice can be so easily limited through the constraints from information processing and reliance on prior expertise frequently driven more by administrative rather than clinical objectives. These anticipated many of the deeper ethical problems that have arisen since then in clinical informatics. CONCLUSION(S): Early papers on ethics in clinical decision-making provide prescient commentary on the dangers of not taking into account the complexities of individual human decision making in clinical encounters. These include the excessive reliance on data and experts, and oversimplified models of human reasoning, all of which persist and have become amplified today as urgent questions about how inclusivity, equity, and bias are handled in practical systems where ethical responsibilities of individuals patients and practitioners intertwine with those of groups within professional or other communities, and are central to how clinical encounters evolve in our digital health future.Copyright IMIA and Thieme.

  abstract = {The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

In this article, the implementation details are presented for one specific blockchain-based approach, ExplorerChain, from a software development perspective. The healthcare/ genomic use cases of myocardial infarction, cancer biomarker, and length of hospitalization after surgery are also described. Material(s) and Method(s): ExplorerChain's 3 main technical components, including online machine learning, metadata of transaction, and the Proof-of-Information-Timed (PoINT) algorithm, are introduced in this study. Specifically, the 3 algorithms (ie, core, new network, and new site/data) are described in detail. Result(s): ExplorerChain was implemented and the design details of it were illustrated, especially the development configurations in a practical setting. Also, the system architecture and programming languages are introduced. The code was also released in an open source repository available at https://github.com/tsungtingkuo/ explorerchain. Discussion(s): The designing considerations of semi-trust assumption, data format normalization, and non-determinism was discussed. The limitations of the implementation include fixed-number participating sites, limited join-or-leave capability during initialization, advanced privacy technology yet to be included, and further investigation in ethical, legal, and social implications. Conclusion(s): This study can serve as a reference for the researchers who would like to implement and even deploy blockchain technology. Furthermore, the off-the-shelf software can also serve as a cornerstone to accelerate the development and investigation of future healthcare/genomic blockchain studies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract = {Background Unprecedented public health measures have been used during this coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is a challenge to implement timely and appropriate public health interventions. Methods and findings Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting. In addition, our research focuses only on population health benefits by controlling the spread of COVID-19 without balancing the negative impacts of economic and social consequences. Interpretation Compared to actual government implementation, our algorithm mostly recommended earlier intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Reinforcement learning may be used as a decision support tool for implementation of public health interventions during COVID-19 and future pandemics.Copyright © 2021 Kwak et al.

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. The course of CLL and patients' response to treatment are varied. This variability makes it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment regimen and predict the progression of the disease. This work was aimed at developing and validating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to predict changes of the health status of patients with CLL and progression of the disease over time. Two DBNs were developed and implemented i.e. Health Status Network (HSN) and Treatment Effect Network (TEN). Based on the literature data and expert knowledge we identified relationships linking the most important factors influencing the health status and treatment effects in patients with CLL. The developed networks, and in particular TEN, were able to predict probability of survival in patients with CLL, which was in line with the survival data collected in large medical registries. The networks can be used to personalize the predictions, taking into account a priori knowledge concerning a particular patient with CLL. The proposed approach can serve as a basis for the development of artificial intelligence systems that facilitate the choice of treatment that maximizes the chances of survival in patients with CLL.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide, syndromic surveillance is increasingly used for improved and timely situational awareness and early identification of public health threats. Syndromic data streams are fed into detection algorithms, which produce statistical alarms highlighting potential activity of public health importance. All alarms must be assessed to confirm whether they are of public health importance. In England, approximately 100 alarms are generated daily and, although their analysis is formalised through a risk assessment process, the process requires notable time, training, and maintenance of an expertise base to determine which alarms are of public health importance. The process is made more complicated by the observation that only 0.1\% of statistical alarms are deemed to be of public health importance. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate machine learning as a tool for computer-assisted human decision-making when assessing statistical alarms., METHODS: A record of the risk assessment process was obtained from Public Health England for all 67,505 statistical alarms between August 2013 and October 2015. This record contained information on the characteristics of the alarm (e.g. size, location). We used three Bayesian classifiers- naive Bayes, tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets - to examine the risk assessment record in England with respect to the final 'Decision' outcome made by an epidemiologist of 'Alert', 'Monitor' or 'No-action'. Two further classifications based upon tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets were implemented to account for the predominance of 'No-action' outcomes., RESULTS: The attributes of each individual risk assessment were linked to the final decision made by an epidemiologist, providing confidence in the current process. The naive Bayesian classifier performed best, correctly classifying 51.5\% of 'Alert' outcomes. If the 'Alert' and 'Monitor' actions are combined then performance increases to 82.6\% correctly classified. We demonstrate how a decision support system based upon a naive Bayes classifier could be operationalised within an operational syndromic surveillance system., CONCLUSIONS: Within syndromic surveillance systems, machine learning techniques have the potential to make risk assessment following statistical alarms more automated, robust, and rigorous. However, our results also highlight the importance of specialist human input to the process.},

App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm, substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64\%) claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44\%), although this included techniques not validated by literature searches (8/24\,=\,33\%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14\%) described design or development involving lived experience, and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.},

Furthermore, deep learning (DL) methods are well-suited to process the broad amounts of data acquired by wearable devices, smartphones, and other sensors employed in different medical domains. Conceived to serve the role of diagnostic tool and surgical guidance, hyperspectral images emerged as a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free technology. However, the lack of large datasets to efficiently train the models limits DL applications in the medical field. Hence, its usage with hyperspectral images is still at an early stage. We propose a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic hyperspectral images of epidermal lesions, targeting skin cancer diagnosis, and overcome small-sized datasets challenges to train DL architectures. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, capable of generating synthetic data to train DL classifiers.},

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries that identified 99 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 14 were selected for consideration as best paper candidates. The 14 papers were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. Three papers that received the highest score were discussed in a consensus meeting and were agreed upon as best papers on artificial intelligence in health for patients and consumers in the year 2018.   Results: Only a small number of 2018 papers reported Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for patients and consumers. No studies were found on AI applications designed specifically for patients or consumers, nor were there studies that elicited patient and consumer input on AI. Currently, the most common use of AI for patients and consumers lies in secondary analysis of social media data (e.g., online discussion forums). In particular, the three best papers shared a common methodology of using data-driven algorithms (such as text mining, topic modelling, Latent Dirichlet allocation modelling), combined with insight-led approaches (e.g., visualisation, qualitative analysis and manual review), to uncover patient and consumer experiences of health and illness in online communities.   Conclusions: While discussion remains active on how AI could 'revolutionise' healthcare delivery, there is a lack of direction and evidence on how AI could actually benefit patients and consumers. Perhaps instead of primarily focusing on data and algorithms, researchers should engage with patients and consumers early in the AI research agenda to ensure we are indeed asking the right questions, and that important use cases and critical contexts are identified together with patients and consumers. Without a clear understanding on why patients and consumers need AI in the first place, or how AI could support individuals with their healthcare needs, it is difficult to imagine the kinds of AI applications that would have meaningful and sustainable impact on individual daily lives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The timeliness of detection of a sepsis incidence in progress is a crucial factor in the outcome for the patient. Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model., METHODS: In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time., RESULTS: Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time., CONCLUSION: We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

A machine learning model used REVEAL data to predict TWPI for patients in the risankizumab trials. These values were used to estimate work loss hours and work impairment-related indirect costs for each treatment cohort. Results Among REVEAL patients (N = 741), TWPI in the PASI 100, 90-99, 75-89 cohorts was lower than the PASI {$<$}75 cohort (p {$<$} .05); mean TWPI was lowest with PASI 100 (1.7\%) vs. 90-99 (2.5\%) vs. 75-89 (4.8\%) vs. {$<$}75 (14.3\%). There was a significant (p {$<$} .0001) monotonic relationship between higher PASI response and lower TWPI. In the risankizumab trials (N = 2046), incremental TWPI relative to risankizumab was 3.4\%/week for ustekinumab/adalimumab, and 17.1\%/week for placebo; incremental indirect cost savings for risankizumab were \$2179/year vs. adalimumab, \$2321/year vs. ustekinumab, and \$11,284/year vs. placebo. Conclusions Higher PASI responses were associated with reduced TWPI. Risankizumab was associated with less work impairment/indirect costs vs. ustekinumab/adalimumab/placebo.},

  abstract = {Background No previous study has comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning algorithms in mood disorders populations. Herein, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate previous studies of machine learning-devised models that predict therapeutic outcomes in mood disorders populations. Methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed from inception to February 8, 2018 for relevant studies that included adults with bipolar or unipolar depression; assessed therapeutic outcomes with a pharmacological, neuromodulatory, or manual-based psychotherapeutic intervention for depression; applied a machine learning algorithm; and reported predictors of therapeutic response. A random-effects meta-analysis of proportions and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Results We identified 639 records: 75 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility; 26 studies (n=17,499) and 20 studies (n=6325) were included in qualitative and quantitative review, respectively. Classification algorithms were able to predict therapeutic outcomes with an overall accuracy of 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of [0.77, 0.87]). Pooled estimates of classification accuracy were significantly greater (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) in models informed by multiple data types (e.g., composite of phenomenological patient features and neuroimaging or peripheral gene expression data; pooled proportion [95\% CI] = 0.93[0.86, 0.97]) when compared to models with lower-dimension data types (pooledproportion=0.68[0.62,0.74]to0.85[0.81,0.88]). Limitations Most studies were retrospective; differences in machine learning algorithms and their implementation (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning); cannot infer importance of individual variables fed into learning algorithm. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms provide a powerful conceptual and analytic framework capable of integrating multiple data types and sources. An integrative approach may more effectively model neurobiological components as functional modules of pathophysiology embedded within the complex, social dynamics that influence the phenomenology of mental disorders.},

The purpose of this paper is to identify what affects users' intention to reuse and whether they perceive any difference between the two. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model was developed based on computer-mediated communication (CMC) and interpersonal communication theories. Data were collected online from four different continents (North America, Europe, Asia and Australia). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research model. Findings The findings mainly reveal that media richness and social presence positively influence trust and reuse intention through task attraction and social attraction; IM users reported significantly higher scores in terms of communication experience, perceived attractiveness of the conversational agent, and trust than chatbot users; users' trust in the conversational agents is mainly determined by perceived task attraction. Research limitations/implications Customers' evaluation of the communication environment is positively related to their perceived competence of the conversational agent which ultimately affect their intention to reuse chatbot/IM. The findings reveal determinants of chatbot/IM adoption which have rarely been mentioned by previous work. Practical implications Practitioners should note that consumers in general still prefer to interact with human conversational agents. Practitioners should contemplate how to combine chatbot and human resources effectively to deliver the best customer service. Originality/value This study goes beyond the Computer as Social Actor paradigm and Technology Acceptance Model to understand chatbot and IM adoption. It is among one of the first studies that compare chatbot and IM use experience in the tourism and hospitality literature.},

Here the authors employ 3D printing and machine learning to advance clinical predictions of current spread for cochlear implant patients. Cochlear implants restore hearing in patients with severe to profound deafness by delivering electrical stimuli inside the cochlea. Understanding stimulus current spread, and how it correlates to patient-dependent factors, is hampered by the poor accessibility of the inner ear and by the lack of clinically-relevant in vitro, in vivo or in silico models. Here, we present 3D printing-neural network co-modelling for interpreting electric field imaging profiles of cochlear implant patients. With tuneable electro-anatomy, the 3D printed cochleae can replicate clinical scenarios of electric field imaging profiles at the off-stimuli positions. The co-modelling framework demonstrated autonomous and robust predictions of patient profiles or cochlear geometry, unfolded the electro-anatomical factors causing current spread, assisted on-demand printing for implant testing, and inferred patients' in vivo cochlear tissue resistivity (estimated mean = 6.6 k omega cm). We anticipate our framework will facilitate physical modelling and digital twin innovations for neuromodulation implants.},

  abstract = {Purpose Contrary to the popular and general term Artificial Intelligence, the more neutral expression Machine Intelligence (MI) is used at CARS as an umbrella term for this very significant information technology. In general, MI is presented and discussed at CARS in the specific context of assisting medical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in radiology and surgery. Machine learning, deep learning and clinical decision support systems are typical examples of MI in sessions of past CARS congresses. Within this specific medical focus, MI is providing new technical and clinical capabilities using advanced mathematical methods and innovative information technology tools. The CARS 2018 Special Session on Machine Intelligence addresses 5 critical questions relating to the substance, relevance, applications, impact and implications of mathematical methods and algorithms of MI: 1. What qualifies a mathematical method or an information technology tool to be considered as machine, artificial or computational intelligence (or any other synonym or nearsynonym) for radiology or surgery? 2. Which mathematical method or information technology tools are of particular relevance for applying MI in radiology and surgery? 3. How can these mathematical method or information technology tools for MI be applied to improve clinical work flow and/or patient outcome? 4. When can results and impact of MI be expected for improved clinical workflow and patient outcome? 5. What are the potential economic, social and ethical implications of MI in radiology and surgery specifically, and in health care generally? The potential answers to these questions are likely to be of a very divergent nature. A group of experts at CARS will endeavor to converge the answers to reproducible and actionable insights. These should also serve as guidelines for future research in MI for computer assisted radiology and surgery. Methods Something to be assigned "intelligent" in the context of CARS, could be defined to imply a system which has an adequate representation/ model of the present situation, an adequate representation/model of a desired future situation, and an executable plan (process model) to proceed from the present situation in an optimal way to the desired future situation [1]. For example in the context of machine intelligence in the digital operating room (DOR), this implies the availability of appropriate models of the patient and the systems/ environments in the DOR as well as the interventional processes to be followed. The IT architecture of a medical information and model management system (MIMMS) and specifically a therapy imaging and model management system (TIMMS) [3] for the OR environment (Fig. 1) have been designed to fulfill such requirements and are in development at various R\&D centers. (Figure Presented) In the language as found in the classic artificial intelligence literature [4], the engines made available to fulfill the required functionalities are agents of various characteristics such as Simple Reflex, Model-based, Goal-based, Utility-based or Learning Agents. In the context of clinical decision making, for example in the complex decision-making cycles involved in monitoring the progress of a procedure, this may imply usage of software agents at various positions of the surgical workflow, see Fig. 2 [5]. (Figure Presented) As presented byW.Crebbin et al. in [5] and shown as an extract of the surgical process in Figure 2, "clinical decision making is a core competency of surgical practice. It involves two distinct types of mental processes best considered as the ends of a continuum, ranging from intuitive and subconscious to analytical and conscious". These types of processes may best be presented by human and software agents, respectively, as the state-of-the-art in machine intelligence may support. Results Different stages of maturity have been identified in the development of the DOR for the first quarter of the twenty-first century [2]: Current research on the DOR suggests that the following machine intelligence driven features can be expected to be realized during the next 10 years: * Knowledge and decision management * Patient specific models * Surgical cockpit systems * Model-Based Medical Evidence (MBME) * Real time access to P2P surgical process repositories * Intelligent real time data mining * Full voice/gesture control * Medical TIMMS architecture * Real time CAD integration * Intelligent (situation aware) robotic devices A relatively comprehensive set of models and algorithms (mathematical methods and information technology tools) for intelligent (learning) behavior have been developed in recent years. They can serve as enablers of the above features expected for the digital operating room of the future. Discussion Trust in this form of "intelligence" and in the right record keeping and subsequent management of interventional process information for patient outcome evaluation, are new dimensions of concern when machine intelligence moves into therapeutic activities within the context of a DOR. The other dimensions relate to economics and ethics. In particular, how do we define the measures of goodness or success regarding outcome for the patient, physician and healthcare at large, when applying advanced IT methods, including machine intelligence, in specific clinical domains. One of the real human intellectual challenges ahead (something which cannot be done by the machine!) is to find the right balance between success and resources in the design, implementation, application and evaluation of MIMMS like architectures.},

The early identification of potential admissions could act as an additional decision support tool to alert clinicians that a patient needs to be reviewed for admission and would also be of benefit to bed managers in advance bed planning for the patient. We aim to create a low-dimensional model predicting admissions early from the paediatric Emergency Department. Methods and Analysis: The methodology Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) will be followed. The dataset will comprise of 2 years of data, similar to 76,000 records. Potential predictors were identified from previous research, comprising of demographics, registration details, triage assessment, hospital usage and past medical history. Fifteen models will be developed comprised of 3 machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, naive Bayes and gradient boosting machine) and 5 sampling methods, 4 of which are aimed at addressing class imbalance (undersampling, oversampling, and synthetic oversampling techniques). The variables of importance will then be identified from the optimal model (selected based on the highest Area under the curve) and used to develop an additional low-dimensional model for deployment. Discussion: A low-dimensional model comprised of routinely collected data, captured up to post triage assessment would benefit many hospitals without data rich platforms for the development of models with a high number of predictors. Novel to the planned study is the use of data from the Republic of Ireland and the application of sampling techniques aimed at improving model performance impacted by an imbalance between admissions and discharges in the outcome variable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems are becoming increasingly prevalent with advances in data collection and machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, they are scarcely used for empiric antibiotic therapy. Here, we predict the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacterial infections of hospitalized patients using ML algorithms applied to patients' electronic medical records (EMRs)., METHODS: The data included antibiotic resistance results of bacterial cultures from hospitalized patients, alongside their EMRs. Five antibiotics were examined: ceftazidime (n = 2942), gentamicin (n = 4360), imipenem (n = 2235), ofloxacin (n = 3117), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (n = 3544). We applied lasso logistic regression, neural networks, gradient boosted trees, and an ensemble that combined all 3 algorithms, to predict antibiotic resistance. Variable influence was gauged by permutation tests and Shapely Additive Explanations analysis., RESULTS: The ensemble outperformed the separate models and produced accurate predictions on test set data. When no knowledge regarding the infecting bacterial species was assumed, the ensemble yielded area under the receiver-operating characteristic (auROC) scores of 0.73-0.79 for different antibiotics. Including information regarding the bacterial species improved the auROCs to 0.8-0.88. Variables' effects on predictions were assessed and found to be consistent with previously identified risk factors for antibiotic resistance., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the potential of ML to predict antibiotic resistance of bacterial infections of hospitalized patients. Moreover, we show that rapidly gained information regarding the infecting bacterial species can improve predictions substantially. Clinicians should consider the implementation of such systems to aid correct empiric therapy and to potentially reduce antibiotic misuse. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

While feature extraction with unsupervised machine learning is widely used in analyzing complex data on clustering, classification, and visualization, we show its direct usage on discovering interpretable physical concepts and then obtaining images from wave-propagation data. By using a spring-mass lattice as a simplified model in acoustic imaging, a variational autoencoder is trained to extract features that govern the dynamics of wave propagation from configurations with uncorrelated random material parameters. The extracted features are transformed to images of spring constants and masses by an additional linear regression. The current scheme of extraction-based inverse imaging of features is robust against noise in wave-propagation data and incomplete accessibility in the case of inverse scattering in practice. Our approach requires minimal prior knowledge of the wave-scattering mechanism with applications from the extraction of physical constants and defect detection to discovering physical phenomena.},

  abstract = {Due to the high mortality of many cancers and their related diseases, the prediction and prognosis techniques of cancers are being extensively studied to assist doctors in making diagnoses. Many machine-learning-based cancer predictors have been put forward, but many of them have failed to become widely utilised due to some crucial problems. For example, most methods require too much training data, which is not always applicable to institutes, and the complicated genetic mutual effects of cancers are generally ignored in many proposed methods. Moreover, a majority of these assist models are actually not safe to use, as they are generally built on black-box machine learners that lack references from related field knowledge. We observe that few machine-learning-based cancer predictors are capable of employing prior knowledge (PrK) to mitigate these issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generalisable informed machine learning architecture named the Informed Attentive Predictor (IAP) to make PrK available to the predictor's decision-making phases and apply it to the field of cancer prediction. Specifically, we make several implementations of the IAP and evaluate its performance on six TCGA datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture as an assist system framework for actual clinical usage. The experimental results show a noticeable improvement in IAP models on accuracies, f1-scores and recall rates compared to their non-IAP counterparts (i.e., basic predictors).},

  abstract = {Background. Invasive candidiasis is a common cancer-related complication with a high fatality rate. If patients with a high risk of dying in the hospital are identified early and accurately, physicians can make better clinical judgments. However, epidemiological analyses and mortality prediction models of cancer patients with invasive candidiasis remain limited. Method. A set of 40 potential risk factors was acquired in a sample of 258 patients with both invasive candidiasis and cancer. To begin, risk factors for Candida albicans vs. non-Candida albicans infections and persistent vs. nonpersistent Candida infections were analysed using classic statistical methods. Then, we applied three machine learning models (random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine) to identify prognostic indicators related to mortality. Prediction performance of different models was assessed by precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC. Results. Of the 258 patients both with invasive candidiasis and cancer included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 62 years, and 95 (36.82\%) patients were older than 65 years, of which 178 (66.28\%) were male. And 186 (72.1\%) patients underwent surgery 2 weeks before data collection, 100 (39.1\%) patients stayed in ICU during hospitalisation, 99 (38.4\%) patients had bacterial blood infection, 85 (32.9\%) patients had persistent invasive candidiasis, and 41 (15.9\%) patients died within 30 days. The usage of drainage catheter and prolonged length of hospitalisation are the dominant risk factors for non-Candida albicans infections and persistent Candida infections, respectively. Risk factors, such as septic shock, history of surgery within the past 2 weeks, usage of drainage tubes, length of stay in ICU, total parenteral nutrition, serum creatinine level, fungal antigen, stay in ICU during hospitalisation, and total bilirubin level, were significant predictors of death. The RF model outperformed the LR and SVM models. Precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC for RF were 64.29\%, 75.63\%, 69.23\%, 89.61\%, and 91.28\%. Conclusions. In this study, the machine learning-based models accurately predicted the prognosis of cancer and invasive candidiasis patients. The algorithm could be used to help clinicians in high-risk patients' early intervention.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) usually presents infrequent infiltration of T lymphocytes. The known immune-checkpoint inhibitors to date focus on activating T cells and manifest limited effectiveness in PDAC. SIGLEC15 was identified as a novel tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-related immune-checkpoint in other cancer types, while its immunosuppressive role and clinical significance remained unclear in PDAC. In our study, SIGLEC15 presented immunosuppressive relevance in PDAC via bioinformatic analysis and expressed on TAM and PDAC cells. SIGLEC15(+) TAM, rather than SIGLEC15(+) PDAC cells or SIGLEC15(-) TAM, correlated with poor prognosis and immunosuppressive microenvironment in the PDAC microarray cohort. Compared with SIGLEC15- TAM, SIGLEC15(+) TAM presented an M2-like phenotype that could be modulated by SIGLEC15 in a tumor cell dependent manner. In mechanism, SIGLEC15 interacted with PDAC-expressed sialic acid, preferentially alpha-2, 3 sialic acids, to stimulate SYK phosphorylation in TAM, which further promoted its immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines production. In vivo, SIGLEC15(+) TAM also presented an M2-like phenotype, accelerated tumor growth, and facilitated immunosuppressive microenvironment, which was greatly abolished by SYK inhibitor. Our study highlighted a novel M2-promoting function of SIGLEC15 and strongly suggested SIGLEC15 as a potential immunotherapeutic target for PDAC.},

Here, we assessed such bias in prediction models of behavioral phenotypes from brain functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined the prediction bias using two independent datasets (pre-adolescent versus adult) of mixed ethnic/racial composition. When predictive models were trained on data dominated by white Americans (WA), out-of-sample prediction errors were generally higher for African Americans (AA) than for WA. This bias toward WA corresponds to more WA-like brain-behavior association patterns learned by the models. When models were trained on AA only, compared to training only on WA or an equal number of AA and WA participants, AA prediction accuracy improved but stayed below that for WA. Overall, the results point to the need for caution and further research regarding the application of current brain-behavior prediction models in minority populations.},

  abstract = {Preschool language education is a requirement of basic education reform as well as a requirement for children's growth in all aspects of body and mind. It is extremely important and valuable in encouraging the entire growth of preschool education as well as children's general harmonious development. The degree of informatization is changing day by day, and many information technology concepts and tools have entered the preschool education field. The Internet, electronic school bags, ECE whiteboards, terminal devices, and rich digital resources and tools have been introduced into kindergarten classrooms. The continuous advancement and application of information technology have provided the feasibility of building a smart learning environment for kindergartens. To this end, this paper starts from the core concepts and theoretical foundations of preschool education and sorts out the concepts of learning resources, smart learning, and smart learning environments. Learning theory, teaching theory, and activity theory provide the theoretical foundation for the creation of language learning tools in preschool education. The technologies of campus network, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and rich media are examined under the role and inspiration of smart learning environment to provide theoretical support for scientific design of smart language learning environment in preschool education.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To describe nurses' views on the potential use of robots in the pediatric unit. Design and methods: A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 nursing staff who worked in the pediatric unit. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Three themes emerged related to the nurses' views on the potential use of robots in the pediatric unit (1) care impact - advantages, which included: (a) reducing healthcare providers' workload and (b) adequately meeting the needs of pediatric patients and their families; (2) care impact - shortcomings, which included: (a) deficiency of individualized care and (b) reduced employment opportunities for skilled nursing staff; and (3) attitude impact, including (a) lifelong learning and (b) integrating culture and technology to meet pediatric care needs. Conclusions: Robots' application may ameliorate the overall quality of pediatric care, allowing for better apportioning of nurses' time and energies to focus on direct patient care and reducing nurses' workloads. However, some possible disadvantages need attention, including robots' inability to provide genuine human touch, demonstrate human emotions associated with pediatric care, and exhibit cultural sensitivity. It is desirable to embed nursing practice needs in the advanced functions of robots and thereby ensure safe, reliable robotics suitable for pediatric care usage. Practice implications: The findings can be used as a reference for nurses encountering challenges in working with robots, and for lifelong learning needs for pediatric nurses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.},

  abstract = {Performance regressions of large-scale software systems often lead to both financial and reputational losses. In order to detect performance regressions, performance tests are typically conducted in an in-house (non-production) environment using test suites with predefined workloads. Then, performance analysis is performed to check whether a software version has a performance regression against an earlier version. However, the real workloads in the field are constantly changing, making it unrealistic to resemble the field workloads in predefined test suites. More importantly, performance testing is usually very expensive as it requires extensive resources and lasts for an extended period. In this work, we leverage black-box machine learning models to automatically detect performance regressions in the field operations of large-scale software systems. Practitioners can leverage our approaches to complement or replace resource-demanding performance tests that may not even be realistic in a fast-paced environment. Our approaches use black-box models to capture the relationship between the performance of a software system (e.g., CPU usage) under varying workloads and the runtime activities that are recorded in the readily-available logs. Then, our approaches compare the black-box models derived from the current software version with an earlier version to detect performance regressions between these two versions. We performed empirical experiments on two open-source systems and applied our approaches on a large-scale industrial system. Our results show that such black-box models can effectively and timely detect real performance regressions and injected ones under varying workloads that are unseen when training these models. Our approaches have been adopted in practice to detect performance regressions of a large-scale industry system on a daily basis.},

Using simulations has proven to be an effective learning approach for team training. Yet, it has logistical constraints that call for the exploration of virtual environments in delivering team training. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate a team training program using virtual reality vs conventional live simulations on medical and nursing students' communication skill performances and teamwork attitudes. Methods: In June 2018, the authors implemented nurse-physician communication team training using communication tools. A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 120 undergraduate medical and nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake team training using virtual reality or live simulations. The participants from both groups were tested on their communication performances through team-based simulation assessments. Their teamwork attitudes were evaluated using interprofessional attitude surveys that were administered before, immediately after, and 2 months after the study interventions. Results: The team-based simulation assessment revealed no significant differences in the communication performance posttest scores (P=.29) between the virtual and simulation groups. Both groups reported significant increases in the interprofessional attitudes posttest scores from the baseline scores, with no significant differences found between the groups over the 3 time points. Conclusions: Our study outcomes did not show an inferiority of team training using virtual reality when compared with live simulations, which supports the potential use of virtual reality to substitute conventional simulations for communication team training. Future studies can leverage the use of artificial intelligence technology in virtual reality to replace costly human-controlled facilitators to achieve better scalability and sustainability of team-based training in interprofessional education.},

As society calls for cost-effectiveness, and human expertise or expert guidance are not always available, decision support systems (DSSs) are proposed as the solutions. These solutions, however, do not necessarily correspond with the basic needs of their targeted users.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This article presents the development of a telehealthcare decision support system (TDSS) for patients discharged from the hospital, where symptom data are important indications of the recovery progress for patients. Symptom data are difficult to quantify in a telehealthcare application scenario because the observations and perceptions on symptoms by the patient themselves are subjective. In the TDSS, both symptom data from patients and clinical histories from the hospital information system are collected. Machine learning algorithms are used to build a predictive model for classifying patients according to their symptom data and clinical histories, to provide a degree of urgency for the patient to return to the hospital., MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 1-year period, 1,467 patient cases were collected. Symptom data and clinical histories were preprocessed into 49 parameters for machine learning. The training data of patients were validated manually with their actual clinical histories of returning to the hospital. The performances of predictive models trained by five different machine learning algorithms were evaluated and compared., RESULTS: The Bayesian network algorithm had the best performance among the machine learning algorithms tested in this application scenario and was selected to be implemented in the TDSS. On the 1,467 patient cases collected, its precision in 10-fold cross-validation was 79.3\%. The most important six parameters were also selected from the 49 parameters by feature selection. The performance of correct prediction by the TDSS is comparable to that by the nursing team at the call center., CONCLUSIONS: The TDSS provides a degree of urgency for patients to return to the hospital and thereby assists the telehealthcare nursing team in making such decisions. The performance of the TDSS is expected to improve as more cases of patient data are collected and input into the TDSS. The TDSS has been implemented in one of the largest commercialized telehealthcare practices in Taiwan administered by Min-Sheng General Hospital.},

The technological data analysis and predictions made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have assisted medical staff in designing personalized medicine for patients, making AI technologies an important path to precision medicine. During the implementation of the new emerging technology, medical staff's learning intentions will have a great influence on its effectiveness. With reference to the Technology Acceptance Model, this study explored medical staff's attitudes, intentions, and relevant influencing factors in relation to AI application learning. A total of 285 valid questionnaires were collected. Five major factors, perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), subjective norms (SN), attitude towards AI use (ATU), and behavioral intention (BI), were used for analyzing the AI learning of medical staff in a hospital. Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the four endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 37.4\% of the changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of BI. The total effects of SN and PEU were 0.448 and 0.408 respectively, followed by PU, with a total effect of 0.244. As a result, the intentions of medical staff to learn to use AI applications to support precision medicine can be predicted by SN, PEU, PU, and ATU. Among them, subjective norms considering the influences of both supervisors and peers, such as encouragement, communication, and sharing, may assist precision education in supporting the learning attitudes and behavior regarding precision medicine. The research results can provide recommendations for examining medical staff's intention to use AI applications.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish a pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (PLRTIs) database based on the structured electronic medical records (SEMRs), to provide a brief overview and the usage process of the SEMRs and the database. MethodsAll the medical information is recorded by a clinical information system developed by Eureka Systems Company. A plugin of the software was used to set the properties of items of the SEMR. Children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) who were admitted to the department of respiratory medicine of our hospital from May 2020 were included. PostgreSQL 13.1 software was used to construct the PLRTIs database. ResultsSeven kinds of SEMRs were established, and the admission record was the most important and complex among them. It was mainly composed of 10 parts, i.e., basic information, history of present illness, past history (without respiratory disease), past history of respiratory diseases, personal history, family history, physical examination, the score of LRTIs, auxiliary examination, and diagnosis. With the three-level doctor ward round, the recorded information of the SEMR would be checked repeatedly, thus guaranteeing the correctness of the information. The data of the SEMR and laboratory tests could be extracted directly from the hospital information system (HIS) by PostgreSQL 13.1 software with the specific structured query language (SQL) code. After manually checking the original records, the datasets were imported into PostgreSQL 13.1 software, and a simple PLRTIs database was constructed. According to the inclusion criteria of this study, a total of 1,184 children with LRTIs were included in this database from 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2021. ConclusionA series of SEMRs for PLRTIs were designed and used during the hospitalization. A simple PLRTIs database was established based on the SEMR. The SEMRs will provide complete and high-quality data on LRTIs in children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Liver disease, the most common disease in Taiwan, is not easily discovered in its initial stage; early diagnosis of this leading cause of mortality is therefore highly important. The design of an effective diagnosis model is therefore an important issue in liver disease treatment. This study accordingly employs classification and regression tree (CART) and case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to structure an intelligent diagnosis model aiming to provide a comprehensive analytic framework to raise the accuracy of liver disease diagnosis., METHODS: Based on the advice and assistance of doctors and medical specialists of liver conditions, 510 outpatient visitors using ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision) codes at a medical center in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 were selected as the cases in the data set for liver disease diagnosis. Data on 340 patients was utilized for the development of the model and on 170 patients utilized to perform comparative analysis of the models. This paper accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the diagnosis of liver diseases which integrates CART and CBR. The major steps in applying the model include: (1) adopting CART to diagnose whether a patient suffers from liver disease; (2) for patients diagnosed with liver disease in the first step, employing CBR to diagnose the types of liver diseases., RESULTS: In the first phase, CART is used to extract rules from health examination data to show whether the patient suffers from liver disease. The results indicate that the CART rate of accuracy is 92.94\%. In the second phase, CBR is developed to diagnose the type of liver disease, and the new case triggers the CBR system to retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to support the treatment of liver disease. The new case is supported by a similarity ratio, and the CBR diagnostic accuracy rate is 90.00\%. Actual implementation shows that the intelligent diagnosis model is capable of integrating CART and CBR techniques to examine liver diseases with considerable accuracy. The model can be used as a supporting system in making decisions regarding liver disease diagnosis and treatment. The rules extracted from CART are helpful to physicians in diagnosing liver diseases. CBR can retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to solve a new liver disease problem and can be of great assistance to physicians in identifying the type of liver disease, reducing diagnostic errors and improving the quality and effectiveness of medical treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical decision support tools based on predictive analytics can provide actionable information and improve clinical outcomes for patients at risk of developing sepsis. Scoring systems such as Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) that were not specifically trained to detect sepsis tend to have high false alarm rates, leading to physician alarm fatigue. Our academic institution previously implemented NEWS to prompt assessment for sepsis, but 63\% of alarms were cancelled by the care nurse. The goal of this study was to develop a machine learning model to improve early detection of sepsis, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning. Method(s): This was a retrospective study of all adult inpatient admissions (n=43,046) at a large academic hospital from October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Patient demographics, comorbidities, vitals, lab results, and medication data were extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), yielding 83 predictor variables. Our dataset included 25 million vital sign measurements, 1.9 million medication administrations, and 5.2 million lab results. We used deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a form of deep learning for sequential data, to predict onset of sepsis. We combined this deep learning model with multi-output Gaussian processes (MGPs), which interpolate and impute continuous functions for physiological time series variables, to create our final model, denoted MGP-RNN. We compared MGP-RNN with a RNN ("Raw RNN"), penalized logistic regression (PLR), SIRS, and NEWS. We calculated Cstatistics and false alarms per true alarm at 80\% sensitivity, as a function of the number of hours in advance of sepsis. Result(s): Figure 1 compares performance among machine learning models and clinical scores. Our proposed MGP-RNN consistently performs best, both in terms of C-statistics and false alarms. The machine learning methods generally perform better than the clinical scores, and NEWS performed worst overall. Figure 2 demonstrates an inpatient timeline for a sample patient; our model detected sepsis 17 hours prior to the first antibiotic administration for infection and 36 hours before a sepsis definition was met. Conclusion(s): In this study, we developed a deep learning approach to improve early detection of sepsis. Our model consistently outperformed strong baseline methods, and had considerably fewer false alarms than SIRS and NEWS. Our methodology ingests commonly available predictors from the EHR and can be applied to predict other inpatient events, such as cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, and mortality.

Methods: As the availability and use of mental health apps has increased, so too has the list of recommendations and guidelines for efficacious development. We describe the development and testing conducted between 2018 and 2020 and assess the quality of the \#Here4U App against 16 criteria for rigorous mental health app development, as identified by Bakker and colleagues in 2016. Results: The \#Here4U App - Military Version met the majority of Bakker and colleagues' criteria, with those unmet considered not applicable to this particular product or out of scope for research conducted to date. Notably, a formal evaluation of the efficacy of the app is a major priority moving forward.

  abstract = {Background: An individual's mental health is best captured by considering the overall associations of biological, behavioral, and social functions that comprise the framework of individual experience. As such, accessing data on various health indicators concurrently can influence prediction of disease progression or change in response to treatment. Data generated passively by smartphones to measure human behavior has generated significant research interest and has increasingly been utilized in psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, passive and continuous assessment of how an individual uses their mobile device may give rise to clinically useful markers that can be used to improve treatment processes, adapt treatment choices, identify early risk for relapse to initiate clinical intervention, and develop new clinical models. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in mobile technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping of digital data. . In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (passive data collection -{$>$} data storage and curation -{$>$} trait extraction -{$>$} machine learning/classification -{$>$} models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. Digital phenotyping can be used in conjunction with standard care to reduce time to recognition and acknowledgement that worsening of a symptom needs to be addressed, to reduce time to receiving appropriate level of care, to increase ability to analyze and collect data from a variety of sources to improve mental health needs assessment and delivery of services, and to advance outcome measurement through comparison of passive and active data sets. Aim(s): The aim of this pilot study is to test whether a smartphone digital phenotyping application can help detect early signs of treatment failure or response in individuals with chronic schizophrenia after discharge from hospital. Method(s): 17 individuals with DSM-5 schizophrenia were provided with a smartphone and digital phenotyping app, MindStrong Health app, following discharge from an inpatient psychiatric facility. The participants were followed for 6 months with monthly rater administered evaluations assessing neurocognition (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS)), symptomatology (PANSS; CGI-S/I), quality of life (SF-36), healthcare utilization, alcohol/drug use, level of clinical insight and depression (Calgary Depression Rating Scale, CDSS). Digital phenotyping data included gestures (swipes, taps, other), orientation (the way the phone is pointing), acceleration (sudden movements of the phone), keystroke patterns with characters encoded, number of calls made, number of emails sent, number of text messages sent, and location information from the GPS. Predictive models were built using multiple machine learning techniques - random forest plots, linear regression and gradient boosting, to predict the target scores based on phone usage patterns. Result(s): Of the 17 enrolled participants, 10 provided analyzable data (i.e., had at least 22 target days with data). There was a gradual reduction of passive data generation due to either non-use of the smart phone or due to non-recharging of the device. The mean PANSS score was 80.12 (14.56). BACS scores corresponding to motor speed (token motor task), verbal fluency (category instances, letter fluency), and attention and processing speed (symbol coding) were found to be highly correlated with a composite digital phenotyping marker while scores on the PANSS or CDSS were not. Discussion(s): The study provides a basis for using smartphone-base mobile apps to use as an augmentation within clinical practice to gather further information on patients outside the clinic setting, focusing on their behavior in the 'real world.' In particular, the cognitive data derived from the digital device correlated well with rater administered traditional cognitive ratings. Collecting digital data can provide a much needed window into the lives of patients in between normally scheduled visits, while minimizing costs and inconvenience to the patient. Studies with larger sample sizes are required to assess relationships with relapse, rehospitalizations and treatment failure.},

Also important is that the knowledge acquisition process is based on the general practitioner's real needs. This has been achieved by, first, providing general practitioners with real patient data from a series of retrospective database studies; and second, letting a panel of general practitioners select, discuss and decide which computer reminders to implement. A hybrid representation scheme was chosen for the knowledge base. The combination of a standard procedural representation (the so-called Arden syntax) for the reminder knowledge with a semantic net representation for the medical factual knowledge facilitates knowledge sharing with other systems and knowledge reuse within the system.},

Without considering heterogeneity in patients' disease progression, routine monitoring guidelines may lead to inadequate monitoring of sick individuals and unnecessary monitoring of healthy individuals. Prognostic-based monitoring that stratifies the individual's disease progression risk into different levels and adaptively allocates monitoring resources to high-risk individuals has the potential to improve patient health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the monitoring service. However, challenges include how to best apply prognostic models to inform the design of monitoring strategies and identify the cost-effective strategies. To address these challenges, we develop a decision support framework that integrates individual prognostics, monitoring strategy design and cost-effectiveness analysis. We apply the proposed framework to simulate the adaptive monitoring of a depression treatment population from electronic health record data. Several prediction algorithms with increasing complexity, including natural history matching, logistic regression, rule-based method and Markov-based collaborative model, are simulated to monitor high-risk individuals for severe depression over time. We find six cost-effective monitoring strategies and demonstrate that two routine monitoring strategies are dominated by the prognostic-based monitoring strategies. Methods from this research show promise for implementing prognostic-based monitoring of chronic conditions in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 "IISE".},

Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Metagenomic sequencing is becoming a powerful technology for exploring micro-ogranisms from various environments, such as human body, without isolation and cultivation. Accurately identifying genes from metagenomic fragments is one of the most fundamental issues. Results: In this article, we present a novel gene prediction method named MetaGUN for metagenomic fragments based on a machine learning approach of SVM. It implements in a three-stage strategy to predict genes. Firstly, it classifies input fragments into phylogenetic groups by a k-mer based sequence binning method. Then, protein-coding sequences are identified for each group independently with SVM classifiers that integrate entropy density profiles (EDP) of codon usage, translation initiation site (TIS) scores and open reading frame (ORF) length as input patterns. Finally, the TISs are adjusted by employing a modified version of MetaTISA. To identify protein-coding sequences, MetaGun builds the universal module and the novel module. The former is based on a set of representative species, while the latter is designed to find potential functionary DNA sequences with conserved domains. Conclusions: Comparisons on artificial shotgun fragments with multiple current metagenomic gene finders show that MetaGUN predicts better results on both 3' and 5' ends of genes with fragments of various lengths. Especially, it makes the most reliable predictions among these methods. As an application, MetaGUN was used to predict genes for two samples of human gut microbiome. It identifies thousands of additional genes with significant evidences. Further analysis indicates that MetaGUN tends to predict more potential novel genes than other current metagenomic gene finders.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is accompanied by abnormalities in brain functional connections. However, these findings are based on group comparisons, and, therefore, little is known about whether functional connections could be used in the diagnosis of an individual patient with SAD. Here, we explored the potential of the functional connectivity to be used for SAD diagnosis. Twenty patients with SAD and 20 healthy controls were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain was divided into 116 regions based on automated anatomical labeling atlas. The functional connectivity between each pair of regions was computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and used as classification feature. Multivariate pattern analysis was then used to classify patients from healthy controls. The pattern classifier was designed using linear support vector machine. Experimental results showed a correct classification rate of 82.5~\% (p~{$<~$}0.001) with sensitivity of 85.0~\% and specificity of 80.0~\%, using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. It was found that the consensus connections used to distinguish SAD were largely located within or across the default mode network, visual network, sensory-motor network, affective network, and cerebellar regions. Specifically, the right orbitofrontal region exhibited the highest weight in classification. The current study demonstrated that functional connectivity had good diagnostic potential for SAD, thus providing evidence for the possible use of whole brain functional connectivity as a complementary tool in clinical diagnosis. In addition, this study confirmed previous work and described novel pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD.},

The present study examined whether their face scanning patterns could be potentially useful to identify children with ASD by adopting the machine learning algorithm for the classification purpose. Particularly, we applied the machine learning method to analyze an eye movement dataset from a face recognition task [Yi et al., 2016], to classify children with and without ASD. We evaluated the performance of our model in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classifying ASD. Results indicated promising evidence for applying the machine learning algorithm based on the face scanning patterns to identify children with ASD, with a maximum classification accuracy of 88.51\%. Nevertheless, our study is still preliminary with some constraints that may apply in the clinical practice. Future research should shed light on further valuation of our method and contribute to the development of a multitask and multimodel approach to aid the process of early detection and diagnosis of ASD.

Our society is experiencing an ever-growing integration of the Internet into everyday lives, and this has transformed the way we obtain and exchange information, communicate and interact with one another as well as conduct business. However, the term 'Internet addiction' (IA) has emerged from problematic and excessive Internet usage which leads to the development of addictive cyber-behaviours, causing health and social problems. The most commonly used intervention treatments such as motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and retreat or inpatient care mix a variety of psychotherapy theories to treat such addictive behaviour and try to address underlying psychosocial issues that are often coexistent with IA, but the efficacy of these approaches is not yet proved. The aim of this paper is to address the question of whether it is possible to cure IA with the Internet. After detailing the current state-of-the-art including various IA definitions, risk factors, assessment methods and IA treatments, we outline the main research challenges that need to be solved. Moreover, we propose an Internet-based IA Recovery Framework (IARF) which uses AI to closely observe, visualize and analyse patient's Internet usage behaviour for possible staged intervention. The proposal to use smart Internet-based systems to control IA can be expected to be controversial. This paper is intended to stimulate further discussion and research in IA recovery through Internet-based frameworks.},

Based on a combination of the resolution limit constraint and machine learning neural network algorithm, a data-driven and highly tailorable analysis method named spectrum analysis for multiple exponentials via experimental condition oriented simulation (SAME-ECOS) was proposed. Theory and Methods The theory of SAME-ECOS was derived. Then, a paradigm was presented to demonstrate the SAME-ECOS workflow, consisting of a series of calculation, simulation, and model training operations. The performance of the trained SAME-ECOS model was evaluated using simulations and six in vivo brain datasets. The code is available at . Results Using NNLS as the baseline, SAME-ECOS achieved over 15\% higher overall cosine similarity scores in producing the T-2 spectrum, and more than 10\% lower mean absolute error in calculating the myelin water fraction (MWF), as well as demonstrated better robustness to noise in the simulation tests. Applying to in vivo data, MWF from SAME-ECOS and NNLS was highly correlated among all study participants. However, a distinct separation of the myelin water peak and the intra/extra-cellular water peak was only observed in the mean T-2 spectra determined using SAME-ECOS. In terms of data processing speed, SAME-ECOS is approximately 30 times faster than NNLS, achieving a whole-brain analysis in 3 min. Conclusion Compared with NNLS, the SAME-ECOS method yields much more reliable T-2 spectra in a dramatically shorter time, increasing the feasibility of multi-component T-2 decay analysis in clinical settings.},

Though prior research has investigated what affects individuals' adoption of AI-powered service robots in the service industry, few have considered patients' continuance intention for AI-powered service robots at hospitals from the perspective of patients' characteristics. Drawing on the Technology Adoption Model and individual characteristics (i.e., trust in technology and independent personality), we develop a framework testing the factors influencing patients' continuance intention (CI) for AI-powered service robots at hospitals with Intelligent Guide Robots as an example. The model is validated using PLS-SEM analysis and data from 543 patients of a 3-A hospital in Eastern China. The study finds that patients' trust in AI techniques and independent personality positively influence their perception of usefulness (PU), ease-of-use (PEOU), and enjoyment (PE), respectively. Moreover, PU, PEOU, and PE are significant predictors of CI toward AI-powered service robots. PEOU and PE partially mediate the relationship between trust/independent personality and CI. The findings imply that organizations in the healthcare could try their best to increase users' trustworthiness toward AI techniques. In addition, developers could continuously upgrade AI-powered service robots to improve patients' PE and PEOU.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To review for acute abdominal pain (AAP), the diagnostic accuracies of combining decision tools (DTs) and doctors aided by DTs compared with those of unaided doctors. Also to evaluate the impact of providing doctors with an AAP DT on patient outcomes, clinical decisions and actions, what factors are likely to determine the usage rates and usability of a DT and the associated costs and likely cost-effectiveness of these DTs in routine use in the UK. Design(s): Electronic databases were searched up to 1 July 2003. Review methods: Data from each eligible study were extracted. Potential sources of heterogeneity were extracted for both questions. For the accuracy review, meta-analysis was conducted. Among studies comparing diagnostic accuracies of DTs with unaided doctors, error rate ratios provided estimates of the differences between the false-negative and false-positive rates of the DT and unaided doctors' performance. Pooled error rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for false-negative rates and false-positive rates were computed. Metaregression was used to explore heterogeneity. Result(s): Thirty-two studies from 27 articles, all based in secondary care, were eligible for the review of DT accuracies, while two were eligible for the review of the accuracy of hospital doctors aided by DTs. Sensitivities and specificities for DTs ranged from 53 to 99\% and from 30 to 99\%, respectively. Those for unaided doctors ranged from 64 to 93\% and from 39 to 91\%, respectively. Thirteen studies reported false-positive and false-negative rates for both DTs and unaided doctors, enabling a direct comparison of their performance. In random effects meta-analyses, DTs had significantly lower false-positive rates (error rate ratio 0.62, 95\% CI 0.46 to 0.83) than unaided doctors. DTs may have higher false-negative rates than unaided doctors (error rate ratio 1.34, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.93). Significant heterogeneity was present. Two studies compared the diagnostic accuracies of doctors aided by DTs to unaided doctors. In a multiarm cluster randomised controlled trial (n = 5193), the diagnostic accuracy of doctors not given access to DTs was not significantly worse (sensitivity 28.4\% and specificity 96.0\%) than that of three groups of aided doctors (sensitivities of 42.4-47.9\%, and specificities of 95.5-96.5\%, respectively). In an uncontrolled before-and-after study (n = 1484), the sensitivities and specificities of aided and unaided doctors were 95.5\% and 91.5\% (p = 0.24) and 78.1\% and 86.4\% (p {$<$} 0.001), respectively. The metaregression of DTs showed that prospective test-set validation at the site of the tool's development was associated with considerably higher diagnostic accuracy than prospective test-set validation at an independent centre [relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) 8.2; 95\% CI 3.1 to 14.7]. It also showed that the earlier in the year the study was performed the higher the performance (RDOR 0.88, 0.83 to 0.92), that when developers evaluated their own DT there was better performance than when independent evaluators carried out the study (RDOR = 3.0, 1.3 to 6.8), and that there was no evidence of association between other quality indicators and DT accuracy. The one eligible study of the impact study review, a four-arm cluster randomised trial (n = 5193), showed that hospital admission rates of patients by doctors not allocated to a DT (42.8\%) were significantly higher than those by doctors allocated to three combinations of decision support (34.2-38.5\%) (p {$<$} 0.001). There was no evidence of a difference between perforation rates (p = 0.19) and negative laparotomy rates in the four trial arms (p = 0.46). Usage rates of DTs by doctors in accident and emergency departments ranged from 10 to 77\% in the six studies that reported them. Possible determinants of usability include the reasoning method used, the number of items used and the output format. A deterministic cost-effectiveness comparison demonstrated that a paper checklist is likely to be 100-900 times more cost-effective than a computer-based DT under stated assumptions. Conclusion(s): With their significantly greater specificity and lower false-positive rates than doctors, DTs are potentially useful in confirming a diagnosis of acute appendicitis, but not in ruling it out. The clinical use of well-designed, condition-specific paper or computer-based structured checklists is promising as a way to improve impact on patient outcomes, subject to further research. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Inherent physiologic compensatory mechanisms may prevent accurate diagnosis and mask true severity in many circumstances. The objective of this project was the development and validation of a multiparameter machine learning algorithm and system capable of predicting the need for life-saving interventions (LSIs) in trauma patients. Statistics based on means, slopes, and maxima of various vital sign measurements corresponding to 79 trauma patient records generated over 110,000 feature sets, which were used to develop, train, and implement the system. Comparisons among several machine learning models proved that a multilayer perceptron would best implement the algorithm in a hybrid system consisting of a machine learning component and basic detection rules. Additionally, 295,994 feature sets from 82 h of trauma patient data showed that the system can obtain 89.8 \% accuracy within 5 min of recorded LSIs. Use of machine learning technologies combined with basic detection rules provides a potential approach for accurately assessing the need for LSIs in trauma patients. The performance of this system demonstrates that machine learning technology can be implemented in a real-time fashion and potentially used in a critical care environment. © 2013 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: While an artificial intelligence (AI)-based, cardiologist-level, deep-learning model for detecting acute myocardial infarction (AMI), based on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), has been established to have extraordinary capabilities, its real-world performance and clinical appli-cations are currently unknown. (2) Methods and Results: To set up an artificial intelligence-based alarm strategy (AI-S) for detecting AMI, we assembled a strategy development cohort including 25,002 visits from August 2019 to April 2020 and a prospective validation cohort including 14,296 visits from May to August 2020 at an emergency department. The components of AI-S consisted of chest pain symptoms, a 12-lead ECG, and high-sensitivity troponin I. The primary endpoint was to assess the performance of AI-S in the prospective validation cohort by evaluating F-measure, precision, and recall. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the impact on door-to-balloon (DtoB) time before and after AI-S implementation in STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Patients with STEMI were alerted precisely by AI-S (F-measure = 0.932, precision of 93.2\%, recall of 93.2\%). Strikingly, in comparison with pre-AI-S (N = 57) and post-AI-S (N = 32) implan-tation in STEMI protocol, the median ECG-to-cardiac catheterization laboratory activation (EtoCCLA) time was significantly reduced from 6.0 (IQR, 5.0-8.0 min) to 4.0 min (IQR, 3.0-5.0 min) (p {$<$} 0.01). The median DtoB time was shortened from 69 (IQR, 61.0-82.0 min) to 61 min (IQR, 56.8-73.2 min) (p = 0.037). (3) Conclusion(s): AI-S offers front-line physicians a timely and reliable diagnostic decision-support system, thereby significantly reducing EtoCCLA and DtoB time, and facilitating the PPCI process. Nevertheless, large-scale, multi-institute, prospective, or randomized control studies are necessary to further confirm its real-world performance.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {In recent years, many scholars have used data mining algorithms to discover the laws related to the prevention of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Using accident injury records to model occupational risk is a promising direction (for example, predict injury risk from accident frequency and severity). However, the records of specific accident injury data are relatively limited, bringing great difficulties for people to obtain risk knowledge and establish an effective accident consequence prediction model. This article proposes a meta-learning framework called MetaInjury, which can help safety managers share risk knowledge and predict the risk of work-related injuries in various construction industry accidents. When facing small sample data of a new accident type, we first calculate the document vector of the accident description and compare its center vector with vectors in the Meta-knowledge database to find the type of accident most similar. Then, we correspond the meta-features with the best machine learning algorithms on the data set to implement the recommendation of accident prediction algorithms. Through finding the most similar cases and the recommended algorithm, important accident risk factors and accident assessment rules can be shared by safety managers to realize effective risk management. Moreover, specific small sample accident consequences can be predicted by the recommended algorithm. Finally, we verify the method's effectiveness in four different small sample accident data. The results show that the MetaInjury framework can provide theoretical support for preventing small sample accidents and injury reduction in the construction industry.Copyright © 2021},

However, patients with mental illnesses who present similar behavior may be diagnosed differently, which is why a personalized study of each patient is necessary. Following previous promising results in the detection of depression, in this work, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to classify the different states of patients diagnosed with bipolar depressive disorder (BDD). The purpose of this study was to provide relevant information to medical staff and patients’ relatives in order to help them make decisions that may lead to a better management of the disease. The information used was collected from BDD patients through wearable devices (smartwatches), daily self-reports, and medical observation at regular appointments. The variables were processed and then statistical techniques of data analysis, normalization, noise reduction, and feature selection were applied. An individual analysis of each patient was carried out. Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine algorithms were applied with different configurations. The results allowed us to draw some conclusions. Random Forest achieved the most accurate classification, but none of the applied models were the best technique for all patients. Besides, the classification using only selected variables produced better results than using all available information, though the amount and source of the relevant variables differed for each patient. Finally, the smartwatch was the most relevant source of information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical patients incur preventable harm from cognitive and judgment errors made under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients' diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. Decision analysis and techniques of reinforcement learning theoretically can mitigate these challenges but are poorly understood and rarely used clinically. This review seeks to promote an understanding of decision analysis and reinforcement learning by describing their use in the context of surgical decision-making., METHODS: Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched from their inception to June 2019. Included were 41 articles about cognitive and diagnostic errors, decision-making, decision analysis, and machine-learning. The articles were assimilated into relevant categories according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines., RESULTS: Requirements for time-consuming manual data entry and crude representations of individual patients and clinical context compromise many traditional decision-support tools. Decision analysis methods for calculating probability thresholds can inform population-based recommendations that jointly consider risks, benefits, costs, and patient values but lack precision for individual patient-centered decisions. Reinforcement learning, a machine-learning method that mimics human learning, can use a large set of patient-specific input data to identify actions yielding the greatest probability of achieving a goal. This methodology follows a sequence of events with uncertain conditions, offering potential advantages for personalized, patient-centered decision-making. Clinical application would require secure integration of multiple data sources and attention to ethical considerations regarding liability for errors and individual patient preferences., CONCLUSION: Traditional decision-support tools are ill-equipped to accommodate time constraints and uncertainty regarding diagnoses and the predicted response to treatment, both of which often impair surgical decision-making. Decision analysis and reinforcement learning have the potential to play complementary roles in delivering high-value surgical care through sound judgment and optimal decision-making.

  abstract = {Importance: Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making., Observations: Surgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process., Conclusions and Relevance: Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.},

  abstract = {Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems - which use algorithms based on learned examples - may have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical changes occur; can identify modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease onset and progression; can match or exceed human accuracy in recognizing renal tumours on imaging studies; and may augment prognostication and decision-making following renal transplantation. Future AI applications have the potential to make real-time, continuous recommendations for discrete actions and yield the greatest probability of achieving optimal kidney health outcomes. Realizing the clinical integration of AI applications will require cooperative, multidisciplinary commitment to ensure algorithm fairness, overcome barriers to clinical implementation, and build an AI-competent workforce. AI-enabled decision support should preserve the pre-eminence of wisdom and augment rather than replace human decision-making. By anchoring intuition with objective predictions and classifications, this approach should favour clinician intuition when it is honed by experience. Copyright © 2022. Springer Nature Limited.},

We make two contributions in this work. First, we present the publicly available Human Activity Recognition Trondheim dataset (HARTH). Twenty-two participants were recorded for 90 to 120 min during their regular working hours using two three-axial accelerometers, attached to the thigh and lower back, and a chest-mounted camera. Experts annotated the data independently using the camera's video signal and achieved high inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' Kappa =0.96). They labeled twelve activities. The second contribution of this paper is the training of seven different baseline machine learning models for HAR on our dataset. We used a support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, extreme gradient boost, convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and convolutional neural network with multi-resolution blocks. The support vector machine achieved the best results with an F1-score of 0.81 (standard deviation: \& PLUSMN;0.18), recall of 0.85 \& PLUSMN;0.13, and precision of 0.79 \& PLUSMN;0.22 in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Our highly professional recordings and annotations provide a promising benchmark dataset for researchers to develop innovative machine learning approaches for precise HAR in free living.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis is offered to patients who do not benefit from nonoperative treatment. Although surgery is generally successful in reducing symptoms, not all patients benefit. Predicting clinical improvement after surgery could provide decision support and enhance preoperative patient selection., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study aimed to develop and validate prediction models for clinically important improvement in (1) pain and (2) hand function 12 months after surgery for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis., METHODS: Between November 2011 and June 2020, 2653 patients were surgically treated for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis. Patient-reported outcome measures were used to preoperatively assess pain, hand function, and satisfaction with hand function, as well as the general mental health of patients and mindset toward their condition. Patient characteristics, medical history, patient-reported symptom severity, and patient-reported mindset were considered as possible predictors. Patients who had incomplete Michigan Hand outcomes Questionnaires at baseline or 12 months postsurgery were excluded, as these scores were used to determine clinical improvement. The Michigan Hand outcomes Questionnaire provides subscores for pain and hand function. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less pain and better hand function. An improvement of at least the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 14.4 for the pain score and 11.7 for the function score were considered "clinically relevant." These values were derived from previous reports that provided triangulated estimates of two anchor-based and one distribution-based MCID. Data collection resulted in a dataset of 1489 patients for the pain model and 1469 patients for the hand function model. The data were split into training (60\%), validation (20\%), and test (20\%) dataset. The training dataset was used to select the predictive variables and to train our models. The performance of all models was evaluated in the validation dataset, after which one model was selected for further evaluation. Performance of this final model was evaluated on the test dataset. We trained the models using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting machines and compared their performance. We chose these algorithms because of their relative simplicity, which makes them easier to implement and interpret. Model performance was assessed using discriminative ability and qualitative visual inspection of calibration curves. Discrimination was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and is a measure of how well the model can differentiate between the outcomes (improvement or no improvement), with an AUC of 0.5 being equal to chance. Calibration is a measure of the agreement between the predicted probabilities and the observed frequencies and was assessed by visual inspection of calibration curves. We selected the model with the most promising performance for clinical implementation (that is, good model performance and a low number of predictors) for further evaluation in the test dataset., RESULTS: For pain, the random forest model showed the most promising results based on discrimination, calibration, and number of predictors in the validation dataset. In the test dataset, this pain model had a poor AUC (0.59) and poor calibration. For function, the gradient boosting machine showed the most promising results in the validation dataset. This model had a good AUC (0.74) and good calibration in the test dataset. The baseline Michigan Hand outcomes Questionnaire hand function score was the only predictor in the model. For the hand function model, we made a web application that can be accessed via https://analyse.equipezorgbedrijven.nl/shiny/cmc1-prediction-model-Eng/., CONCLUSION: We developed a promising model that may allow clinicians to predict the chance of functional improvement in an individual patient undergoing surgery for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, which would thereby help in the decision-making process. However, caution is warranted because our model has not been externally validated. Unfortunately, the performance of the prediction model for pain is insufficient for application in clinical practice., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

Nonetheless, there is heterogeneity in response to CBTs vs. other treatments. Researchers have become increasingly interested in using pre-treatment individual differences (i.e., moderators) to match patients to the most effective treatments for them. Several methods to combine multiple variables to create precision treatment rules (PTRs) that identify subgroups have been proposed. We review the rationale behind multivariable PTRs as well as the findings of studies that have used different PTRs. We identify conceptual and methodological issues in the literature. Multivariable treatment assignment is a promising avenue of research. Nonetheless, effect sizes appear to be small and most of the samples that have been used to study these questions have been grossly underpowered to detect small effects. We recommend researchers explore multivariable treatment selection strategies, particularly those resembling risk stratification, in heterogeneous samples of patients undergoing low-intensity CBTs vs. realistic minimal controls.},

Smartphone and wearable sensors may capture behavioral and physiological changes indicative of symptom burden, enabling passive and remote real-time monitoring of fluctuating symptoms Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether smartphone and Fitbit data could be used to estimate daily symptom burden before and after pancreatic surgery. Methods: A total of 44 patients scheduled for pancreatic surgery participated in this prospective longitudinal study and provided sufficient sensor and self-reported symptom data for analyses. Participants collected smartphone sensor and Fitbit data and completed daily symptom ratings starting at least two weeks before surgery, throughout their inpatient recovery, and for up to 60 days after postoperative discharge. Day-level behavioral features reflecting mobility and activity patterns, sleep, screen time, heart rate, and communication were extracted from raw smartphone and Fitbit data and used to classify the next day as high or low symptom burden, adjusted for each individual's typical level of reported symptoms. In addition to the overall symptom burden, we examined pain, fatigue, and diarrhea specifically. Results: Models using light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were able to correctly predict whether the next day would be a high symptom day with 73.5\% accuracy, surpassing baseline models. The most important sensor features for discriminating high symptom days were related to physical activity bouts, sleep, heart rate, and location. LightGBM models predicting next-day diarrhea (79.0\% accuracy), fatigue (75.8\% accuracy), and pain (79.6\% accuracy) performed similarly. Conclusions: Results suggest that digital biomarkers may be useful in predicting patient-reported symptom burden before and after cancer surgery. Although model performance in this small sample may not be adequate for clinical implementation, findings support the feasibility of collecting mobile sensor data from older patients who are acutely ill as well as the potential clinical value of mobile sensing for passive monitoring of patients with cancer and suggest that data from devices that many patients already own and use may be useful in detecting worsening perioperative symptoms and triggering just-in-time symptom management interventions.},

In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the business literature about the impact of service robots on customers and employees with the objective of guiding future research. Design/methodology/approach We analyzed the literature on service robots as they relate to customers and employees in business journals listed in the Financial Times top 50 journals plus all journals covered in the cross-disciplinary SERVSIG literature alerts. Findings The analysis of the identified studies yielded multiple observations about the impact of service robots on customers (e.g. overarching frameworks on acceptance and usage of service robots; characteristics of service robots and anthropomorphism; and potential for enhanced and deteriorated service experiences) and service employees (e.g. employee benefits such as reduced routine work, enhanced productivity and job satisfaction; potential negative consequences such as loss of autonomy and a range of negative psychological outcomes; opportunities for human-robot collaboration; job insecurity; and robot-related up-skilling and development requirements). We also conclude that current research on service robots is fragmented, is largely conceptual in nature and focused on the initial adoption stage. We feel that more research is needed to build an overarching theory. In addition, more empirical research is needed, especially on the long(er)-term usage service robots on actual behaviors, the well-being and potential downsides and (ethical) risks for customers and service employees. Research limitations/implications - Our review focused on the business and service literature. Future work may want to include additional literature streams, including those in computer science, engineering and information systems. Originality/value This article is the first to synthesize the business and service literature on the impact of service robots on customers and employees.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is frequent in panic disorder (PD); yet, little is known about its influence on the neural substrates of PD. Difficulties in fear inhibition during safety signal processing have been reported as a pathophysiological feature of PD that is attenuated by depression. We investigated the impact of comorbid depression in PD with agoraphobia (AG) on the neural correlates of fear conditioning and the potential of machine learning to predict comorbidity status on the individual patient level based on neural characteristics. Methods Fifty-nine PD/AG patients including 26 (44\%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG+DEP) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Comorbidity status was predicted using a random undersampling tree ensemble in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Results PD/AG−DEP patients showed altered neural activation during safety signal processing, while +DEP patients exhibited generally decreased dorsolateral prefrontal and insular activation. Comorbidity status was correctly predicted in 79\% of patients (sensitivity: 73\%; specificity: 85\%) based on brain activation during fear conditioning (corrected for potential confounders: accuracy: 73\%; sensitivity: 77\%; specificity: 70\%). Limitations No primary depressed patients were available; only medication-free patients were included. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed (power considerations). Conclusions Neurofunctional activation during safety signal processing differed between patients with or without comorbid depression, a finding which may explain heterogeneous results across previous studies. These findings demonstrate the relevance of comorbidity when investigating neurofunctional substrates of anxiety disorders. Predicting individual comorbidity status may translate neurofunctional data into clinically relevant information which might aid in planning individualized treatment.

Level IV.Setting:Tertiary referral center.Patients:Patients seen for vestibular complaint.Intervention(s):Natural language processing and machine learning analyses of semantic and syntactic patterns in clinical documentation from vestibular patients.Main Outcome Measure:Accuracy of Naive Bayes predictive models correlating language usage with clinical diagnoses.Results:Natural language analyses on 866 physician-generated histories from vestibular patients found 3,286 unique examples of language usage of which 614 were used 10 or greater times. The top 15 semantic types represented only 11\% of all Unified Medical Language System semantic types but covered 86\% of language used in vestibular patient histories. Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms on a subset of 255 notes representing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, anxiety-related dizziness and central dizziness generated strong predictive models showing an average sensitivity rate of 93.4\% and a specificity rate of 98.2\%. A binary model for assessing whether a subject had a specific diagnosis or not had an average AUC for the receiver operating characteristic curves of .995 across all conditions.Conclusions:These results indicate that expert providers utilize unique language patterns in vestibular notes that are highly conserved. These patterns have strong predictive power toward specific vestibular diagnoses. Such language elements can provide a simple vocabulary to aid nonexpert providers in formulating a differential diagnosis. They can also be incorporated into clinical decision support systems to facilitate accurate vestibular diagnosis in ambulatory settings.},

  abstract = {This work investigates a scheduling problem of deadlock-prone flexible manufacturing systems modeled by place-timed Petri nets. It proposes an anytime branch and bound (AB\&B) algorithm for it to minimize system makespan based on the branch tree of a net model and a highly permissive deadlock controller. The proposed algorithm searches a sequence of transitions in the branch tree that evolves the model from the initial marking to the final one. In order to prune the branch tree and increase search speed, this work develops two pruning rules, a lower bound of makespan, and a novel branching strategy. Their usage ensures AB\&B's high search efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art ones. Note to Practitioners-In practice, scheduling is one of the most important issues for production managers to address. Existing approaches to deadlock-prone flexible manufacturing system (FMS) scheduling have multiparameters. Their settings can impact the scheduling results greatly. Since their turning is a challenging task, it is difficult to find the best parameter settings. This article proposes an anytime branch and bound (AB\&B) algorithm for minimizing the makespan of deadlock-prone FMSs. It has only one parameter, i.e., maximal CPU time, which needs no turning. When it is highly tight, AB\&B can output a feasible and decent schedule. If it is larger and larger, AB\&B can output a better and better schedule. Comparison studies show that AB\&B outclasses existing ones significantly. It is suitable for real-time scheduling cases in which satisfied schedules must be offered in a very short time.},

Among all predictive modeling approaches, machine learning methods often achieve the highest prediction accuracy, but suffer from a long-standing open problem precluding their widespread use in healthcare. Most machine learning models give no explanation for their prediction results, whereas interpretability is essential for a predictive model to be adopted in typical healthcare settings. Method(s): This paper presents the first complete method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all 50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Result(s): For the champion machine learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for 87.4 \% of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Conclusion(s): Our demonstration showed the feasibility of automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy.Copyright © 2016 Luo.},

This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. Method: Therapist–patient dyads (N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. Results: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback—outcome and the not on track—outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.

Methods: Here we present a neuroprosthetic system to demonstrate that principle by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to translate the amputee's movement intent through a peripheral nerve interface. The AI agent is designed based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) and could simultaneously decode six degree-of-freedom (DOF) from multichannel nerve data in real-time. The decoder's performance is characterized in motor decoding experiments with three human amputees. Results: First, we show the AI agent enables amputees to intuitively control a prosthetic hand with individual finger and wrist movements up to 97-98\% accuracy. Second, we demonstrate the AI agent's real-time performance by measuring the reaction time and information throughput in a hand gesture matching task. Third, we investigate the AI agent's long-term uses and show the decoder's robust predictive performance over a 16-month implant duration. Conclusion \& significance: Our study demonstrates the potential of AI-enabled nerve technology, underling the next generation of dexterous and intuitive prosthetic hands.},

  abstract = {Free-floating bike-sharing systems have rapidly gained popularity as a viable short-distance transportation mode. As users play a significant role in the movement of the bikes in such a system, the basis for evaluating bike usage is to predict the gap between the locking and unlocking behaviour in a specified grid, which is defined as the inflow and outflow gap. The Spatial-Temporal grid size, including its time and space dimensions, has a significant impact on the microscopic forecasting of the inflow and outflow gap. In this study, a flexible framework for testing the impact of the grid on inflow and outflow gap predictions is proposed. The performance of four algorithms, i.e., linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and gradient boost machine, was compared for different grid sizes based on the dataset provided by the Shanghai Big Data Joint Innovation Laboratory. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to evaluate the impact of grid size on microscopic forecasts. A smaller grid helps to achieve better model prediction results, but it also involves longer calculation time. Comparisons of the four algorithms show that the larger the spatial dimensions of the grid, the worse the predicted results. Excluding random forest, the other algorithms tend to achieve better results when the temporal dimension of the grid is larger. The gradient boost machine algorithm provides the best results in most scenarios; the optimal spatial-temporal grid side length is 200 m, 24 h with 5 by 5 grid combination. Dispatchers or analysts in bike-sharing companies can refer to the proposed framework to select the bike delivery scale and management scope. In addition, this study will help researchers and practitioners quickly select the appropriate grid size and machine learning algorithms for bike-sharing analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in medicine driven by researchers and entrepreneurs goes along with enormous expectations for medical care advancement. AI might change the clinical practice of physicians from almost all medical disciplines and in most areas of health care. While expectations for AI in medicine are high, practical implementations of AI for clinical practice are still scarce in Germany. Moreover, physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the usage of anonymized patient data for clinical and biomedical research have not been investigated widely in German university hospitals., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the secondary usage of patient data for (bio)medical research (eg, for the development of machine learning algorithms) in university hospitals in Germany., METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted addressing physicians of all medical disciplines in 8 German university hospitals. Answers were given using Likert scales and general demographic responses. Physicians were asked to participate locally via email in the respective hospitals., RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 303 physicians (female: 121/303, 39.9\%; male: 173/303, 57.1\%; no response: 9/303, 3.0\%) from a wide range of medical disciplines and work experience levels. Most respondents either had a positive (130/303, 42.9\%) or a very positive attitude (82/303, 27.1\%) towards AI in medicine. There was a significant association between the personal rating of AI in medicine and the self-reported technical affinity level (H4=48.3, P{$<$}.001). A vast majority of physicians expected the future of medicine to be a mix of human and artificial intelligence (273/303, 90.1\%) but also requested a scientific evaluation before the routine implementation of AI-based systems (276/303, 91.1\%). Physicians were most optimistic that AI applications would identify drug interactions (280/303, 92.4\%) to improve patient care substantially but were quite reserved regarding AI-supported diagnosis of psychiatric diseases (62/303, 20.5\%). Of the respondents, 82.5\% (250/303) agreed that there should be open access to anonymized patient databases for medical and biomedical research., CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in stationary patient care in German university hospitals show a generally positive attitude towards using most AI applications in medicine. Along with this optimism comes several expectations and hopes that AI will assist physicians in clinical decision making. Especially in fields of medicine where huge amounts of data are processed (eg, imaging procedures in radiology and pathology) or data are collected continuously (eg, cardiology and intensive care medicine), physicians' expectations of AI to substantially improve future patient care are high. In the study, the greatest potential was seen in the application of AI for the identification of drug interactions, assumedly due to the rising complexity of drug administration to polymorbid, polypharmacy patients. However, for the practical usage of AI in health care, regulatory and organizational challenges still have to be mastered.

Recently, different automated computer-based systems stand to be a helpful tool. Physicians' usage for ABCD worldwide as the main tool of diagnosis and self-examination make it the common reference for different skin cancer diagnosis models. This system is comprised of the main four key warning signs of the ABCD model that can be detected by visual inspection and more accurately identified by the automated system to diagnose melanoma. Based on the image area identified as PSL, through pre-processing and segmentation step, the features will then be detected regarding ABCD rule. According to what ABCD stands for, the proposed study extracts Asymmetry, Border and Color features, in addition to various parameters introduce parameter "D." Finally, as the worldwide definition of ABCD rule of cancer diagnoses was discussed, this research also makes the final decision according to the Total Dermoscopic Score (TDS) Index, in addition to another three popular machine learning classifiers. ANN, SVM, and K-nearest neighbor were used for classification of the segmented lesions in addition to the traditional TDS. This research shows perfect results for calculating the ABCD score automatically, which reflects its viability. Different experiments developed in regard to features variety and different classification methods to reach 98.1\%, 95\%, and 98.75\% classification accuracy when dermoscopic images were classified by TDS, Automatic ANN, and linear SVM, respectively, where the clinical images reached perfect accuracy 100\% when classified by linear SVM, and very promising result 98.75\% as per automatic ANN. This system considered to be the first promising digitalized system for traditional TDS regarding the achieved accuracy and using of a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate user easy use.},

The major problems in analyzing various modality of medical image are the inconsistent orientation and position of the body-parts of interest. In this research, local descriptor of texture, shape and color are used to extract features from multi-modality medical image in patches and interest point's descriptor. The main advantage of using local descriptor is that these features do not need preprocessing method of segmentation and also robust to local changes These features are then will be classified based on its modality using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN) classifiers. It shows that different modality have different characteristic and the importance of selecting significance features.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in machine and deep learning based on an increased availability of clinical data have fueled renewed interest in computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). CDSSs have shown great potential to improve healthcare, increase patient safety and reduce costs. However, the use of CDSSs is not without pitfalls, as an inadequate or faulty CDSS can potentially deteriorate the quality of healthcare and put patients at risk. In addition, the adoption of a CDSS might fail because its intended users ignore the output of the CDSS due to lack of trust, relevancy or actionability., AIM: In this article, we provide guidance based on literature for the different aspects involved in the adoption of a CDSS with a special focus on machine and deep learning based systems: selection, acceptance testing, commissioning, implementation and quality assurance., RESULTS: A rigorous selection process will help identify the CDSS that best fits the preferences and requirements of the local site. Acceptance testing will make sure that the selected CDSS fulfills the defined specifications and satisfies the safety requirements. The commissioning process will prepare the CDSS for safe clinical use at the local site. An effective implementation phase should result in an orderly roll out of the CDSS to the well-trained end-users whose expectations have been managed. And finally, quality assurance will make sure that the performance of the CDSS is maintained and that any issues are promptly identified and solved., CONCLUSION: We conclude that a systematic approach to the adoption of a CDSS will help avoid pitfalls, improve patient safety and increase the chances of success.

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to test e-ASPECTS software in patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) imaging and quantify ischemic extent using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS). Method(s): Using CT from 9 stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of the software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative "front door" hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, and hemorrhage) in the representative population. Result(s): We included 4,100 patients (51\% women, median age = 78 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 10, onset to scan = 2.5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78\%), hemorrhage (14\%), or mimic (8\%). From 3,035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69\%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 70-72\%) for detecting ischemic features, 85\% (83-86\%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12\% vs 2\%) and hemorrhage (14\% vs {$<$}1\%) than experts. Interpretation(s): On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Effective sharing and reuse of Electronic Health Records (EHR) requires technological solutions which deal with different representations and different models of data. This includes information models, domain models and, ideally, inference models, which enable clinical decision support based on a knowledge base and facts. Our goal is to develop a framework to support EHR interoperability based on transformation and reasoning services intended for clinical data and knowledge. Method(s): Our framework is based on workflows whose primary components are reusable mappings. Key features are an integrated representation, storage, and exploitation of different types of mappings for clinical data transformation purposes, as well as the support for the discovery of new workflows. The current framework supports mappings which take advantage of the best features of EHR standards and ontologies. Our proposal is based on our previous results and experience working with both technological infrastructures. Result(s): We have implemented CLIN-IK-LINKS, a web-based platform that enables users to create, modify and delete mappings as well as to define and execute workflows. The platform has been applied in two use cases: semantic publishing of clinical laboratory test results; and implementation of two colorectal cancer screening protocols. Real data have been used in both use cases. Conclusion(s): The CLIN-IK-LINKS platform allows the composition and execution of clinical data transformation workflows to convert EHR data into EHR and/or semantic web standards. Having proved its usefulness to implement clinical data transformation applications of interest, CLIN-IK-LINKS can be regarded as a valuable contribution to improve the semantic interoperability of EHR systems.Copyright © 2020},

Here, we analyzed nine Drosophila piRNA pathway mutants for their impacts on both small RNA populations and the subcellular localization patterns of Piwi proteins. We find that distinct piRNA pathways with differing components function in ovarian germ and somatic cells. In the soma, Piwi acts singularly with the conserved flamenco piRNA cluster to enforce silencing of retroviral elements that may propagate by infecting neighboring germ cells. In the germline, silencing programs encoded within piRNA clusters are optimized via a slicer-dependent amplification loop to suppress a broad spectrum of elements. The classes of transposons targeted by germline and somatic piRNA clusters, though not the precise elements, are conserved among Drosophilids, demonstrating that the architecture of piRNA clusters has coevolved with the transposons that they are tasked to control.},

  abstract = {In the modern world, due to the usage of high-power chemical-based cosmetics, climate change, and other major factors, skin cancer has been increasing among individuals. Skin cancer is considered as the most common malignant disorder, and there are more than a million cases being recorded with this disease every year. Extensive studies have already been performed to identify the risk factors and causative agents for skin cancer, including lifestyle changes and eatery patterns among individuals. The most common type of skin cancer is classified into basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The researcher intends to conduct the research with the primary goal of determining the important factors in blockchain technology in the treatment of skin cancer in senior people. The application of new technologies such as blockchain has enabled offering better promises to health care professionals in addressing skin cancer in a more effective manner. These tools supported in evaluating the nature and severity of psoriasis has been regarded as much support for health care professionals in detecting skin cancer and offer better health care guidance for better living. The detection of melanomas supports the patient in enhancing the prognosis and support in discriminating between the melanomas and less impact lesions. The blockchain-based classification system offers more benefits and reduces the cost of detecting skin cancer in an effective manner. It also helps the medical professionals by assisting them in developing a custom diet plan for each patient on the basis of their health records and food intake. The researchers are focused on applying both the primary data sources and secondary data sources for performing the study. A detailed questionnaire is designed, and it is shared with the participants through university hospitals, support groups, etc. so as to gather the information. Nearly 156 respondents were chosen through nonprobability sampling, and the information was collected. The researcher performs critical descriptive analysis, and correlation analysis is performed to understand the overall association between the variables. The researchers intend to perform the study with the basic goal of understanding the critical factors in blockchain technology in skin cancer for elderly individuals. The major factors involved are enhanced data privacy, support in forecasting patterns, and enhanced medical services to patients complemented with personalized dietary assessment and recommendations. The result demonstrates that artificial intelligence-based blockchain technology allows for the efficient processing of huge amounts of data in order to complete the assigned task and correctly determine and predict the model.},

  abstract = {Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD), but many patients do not respond sufficiently and a substantial proportion relapse after treatment has ended. Predicting an individual’s long-term clinical response therefore remains an important challenge. This study aimed at assessing neural predictors of long-term treatment outcome in participants with SAD 1 year after completion of Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT). Twenty-six participants diagnosed with SAD underwent iCBT including attention bias modification for a total of 13 weeks. Support vector machines (SVMs), a supervised pattern recognition method allowing predictions at the individual level, were trained to separate long-term treatment responders from nonresponders based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to self-referential criticism. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale was the main instrument to determine treatment response at the 1-year follow-up. Results showed that the proportion of long-term responders was 52\% (12/23). From multivariate BOLD responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) together with the amygdala, we were able to predict long-term response rate of iCBT with an accuracy of 92\% (confidence interval 95\% 73.2–97.6). This activation pattern was, however, not predictive of improvement in the continuous Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale—Self-report version. Follow-up psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that lower dACC–amygdala coupling was associated with better long-term treatment response. Thus, BOLD response patterns in the fear-expressing dACC–amygdala regions were highly predictive of long-term treatment outcome of iCBT, and the initial coupling between these regions differentiated long-term responders from nonresponders. The SVM-neuroimaging approach could be of particular clinical value as it allows for accurate prediction of treatment outcome at the level of the individual.},

  abstract = {Older adults are often stereotyped as having less technological ability than younger age groups. As a result, older individuals may avoid using technology due to stereotype threat, the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. The present research examined the role of stereotype threat within the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Across two studies, experiencing stereotype threat in the technological domain was indirectly associated with lower levels of technology use among older adults. This was found for subjective (Study 1) and objective measures (Study 2) of use behaviour, and for technology use in general (Study 1) and computer use in particular (Study 2). In line with the predictions of the Technology Acceptance Model, this relationship was mediated by anxiety, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioural intention. Specifically, stereotype threat was negatively associated with perceived ease of use (Studies 1 and 2) and anxiety mediated this relationship (Study 2). These findings suggest that older adults underuse technology due to the threat of confirming ageist stereotypes targeting their age group. Stereotype threat may thus be an important barrier to technology acceptance and usage in late adulthood.},

Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AI-supported cancer imaging should predict major relevant clinical endpoints, aiming to extract associations and draw inferences in a fair, robust, and trustworthy way. AI-assisted solutions as medical devices, developed using multicenter heterogeneous datasets, should be targeted to have an impact on the clinical care pathway. When designing an AI-based research study in oncologic imaging, ensuring clinical impact in AI solutions requires careful consideration of key aspects, including target population selection, sample size definition, standards, and common data elements utilization, balanced dataset splitting, appropriate validation methodology, adequate ground truth, and careful selection of clinical endpoints. Endpoints may be pathology hallmarks, disease behavior, treatment response, or patient prognosis. Ensuring ethical, safety, and privacy considerations are also mandatory before clinical validation is performed.

A survey of 212 individuals from Taizhou, China found that anthropomorphic tendency, need for cognition, and smart phone usage were positively associated with A(AICR). When controlling for the effect of need for cognition and smart phone usage, the effect of anthropomorphism on attitudes was still robust. Disillusionment toward marketing and life satisfaction were not associated with A(AICR). The results contribute to the tourism literature by showing the effect of anthropomorphism on A(AICR). Tourism practitioners who wish to inspire consumers with AI-curated destination reviews should target consumers with a high anthropomorphic tendency.},

  abstract = {Background: Mental health disorders affect 1 in 10 people globally, of whom approximately 300 million are affected by depression. At least half of the people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces. Objective: This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores. Methods: We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics. Results: The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79\% (77/98) of the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, whereas 17\% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19–related information. Although most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it before account creation. In total, 82\% (74/90) of privacy policies stated sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development teams included academic institutions or health care providers. Conclusions: Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users’ data is widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users’ data security. Trial Registration:},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In-hospital deterioration among ward patients is associated with substantially increased adverse outcome rates. In 2013 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) developed and implemented a predictive analytics-driven program, Advance Alert Monitor (AAM), to improve early detection and intervention for in-hospital deterioration. The AAM predictive model is designed to give clinicians 12 hours of lead time before clinical deterioration, permitting early detection and a patient goals-concordant response to prevent worsening., DESIGN OF THE AAM INTERVENTION: Across the 21 hospitals of the KPNC integrated health care delivery system, AAM analyzes electronic health record (EHR) data for patients in medical/surgical and telemetry units 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Patients identified as high risk by the AAM algorithm trigger an alert for a regional team of experienced critical care virtual quality nurse consultants (VQNCs), who then cascade validated, actionable information to rapid response team (RRT) nurses at local hospitals. RRT nurses conduct bedside assessments of at-risk patients and formulate interdisciplinary clinical responses with hospital-based physicians, bedside nurses, and supportive care teams to ensure a well-defined escalation plan that includes clarification of the patients' goals of care., SUCCESS OF THE INTERVENTION: Since 2019 the AAM program has been implemented at all 21 KPNC hospitals. The use of predictive modeling embedded within the EHR to identify high-risk patients has produced the standardization of monitoring workflows, clinical rescue protocols, and coordination to ensure that care is consistent with patients' individual goals of care. An evaluation of the program, using a staggered deployment sequence over 19 hospitals, demonstrates that the AAM program is associated with statistically significant decreases in mortality (9.8\% vs. 14.4\%), hospital length of stay, and ICU length of stay. Statistical analyses estimated that more than 500 deaths were prevented each year with the AAM program., LESSONS LEARNED: Unlocking the potential of predictive modeling in the EHR is the first step toward realizing the promise of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to improve health outcomes. The AAM program leveraged predictive analytics to produce highly reliable care by identifying at-risk patients, preventing deterioration, and reducing adverse outcomes and can be used as a model for how clinical decision support and inpatient population management can effectively improve care.

Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, specifically linked to being overweight and ages over sixty. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of new strategies to delay and even prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes by a combination of active and healthy lifestyle on cohorts of mid to high risk subjects. Prospective research has been driven on large groups of the population to build risk scores that aim to obtain a rule for the classification of patients according to the odds for developing the disease. Currently, there are more than two hundred models and risk scores for doing this, but a few have been properly evaluated in external groups and integrated into a clinical application for decision support. In this paper, we present a novel system architecture based on service choreography and hybrid modeling, which enables a distributed integration of clinical databases, statistical and mathematical engines and web interfaces to be deployed in a clinical setting. The system was assessed during an eight-week continuous period with eight endocrinologists of a hospital who evaluated up to 8080 patients with seven different type 2 diabetes risk models implemented in two mathematical engines. Throughput was assessed as a matter of technical key performance indicators, confirming the reliability and efficiency of the proposed architecture to integrate hybrid artificial intelligence tools into daily clinical routine to identify high risk subjects.},

  abstract = {Cardiac arrhythmias impose a significant burden on the healthcare environment due to the increasing ratio of mortality worldwide. Arrhythmia and abnormal ECG heartbeat are the possible symptoms of severe heart diseases that can lead to death. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common form of cardiac arrhythmia which begins from the lower chamber of the heart, and frequent occurrence of PVC beat might lead to mortality. ECG signals are the noninvasive and primary tool used to identify the actual life threat related to the heart. Nowadays, in society, the computer-assisted technique reduces doctors' burden to evaluate heart disease and heart arrhythmia automatically. Regardless of well-equipped and well-developed health facilities that are available for monitoring the cardiac condition, the success stories are yet unsatisfactorily due to the complexity of the cardiac disorder. The most challenging part in ECG signal analysis is to extract the accurate features relevant to the arrhythmia for classification due to the inter-patient variation. There are many morphological changes present in the ECG signals. Hence, there is a gap in the usage of appropriate methods for the extraction of features and classification models, which reduce the biased diagnosis of PVC arrhythmia. To predict PVC arrhythmia accurately is a quite challenging task owing to (a) QRS negative (b) long compensatory pause (c) p-wave (d) biased diagnosis of PVC detection due to the small feature set. This study presents a new approach for PVC prediction using derived predictor variables from the electrocardiograph (ECG-MLII) signals: R-R wave interval, previous R-R wave interval, QRS duration, and verification of P-wave whether it is present or absent using threshold technique. We propose the machine learning-data mining MACDM integrated approach using five different models of multiple logistic regression and four classifiers, namely, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). The experiment was conducted on the public benchmark MIT-BIH-AR to evaluate the performance of our proposed MACDM technique. The multiple logistic regression models constructed as a function of all independent variables achieved an accuracy of 99.96\%, sensitivity 98.9\%, specificity 99.20\%, PPV 99.25\%, and Youden's index parameter 98.24\%. Thus, it is proved that this computer-aided method helps our medical practitioners improve the efficiency of their services.},

Setting All non-specialist secondary care providers in England from 27 March27to 5 June 2020. Participants Acute (non-specialist) trusts with a type 1 (ie, 24 hours/day, consultant-led) accident and emergency department (n=125), Nightingale (field) hospitals (n=7) and independent sector secondary care providers (n=195). Main outcome measures Two thresholds for 'safe occupancy' were used: 85\% as per the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92\% as per NHS Improvement. Results At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53\% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62\%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough there were 8.7\% (8508) fewer general and acute beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72\%. The closest to full occupancy of general and acute bed (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8\%. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7\%) spent above 85\% of surge capacity and 154 trust-days (1.8\%) spent above 92\%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100\% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust=1, range: 1-17). However, only three sustainability and transformation partnerships (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100\% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. Conclusions Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed types existed at a national level. However, due to an unequal distribution of bed utilisation, many trusts spent a significant period operating above 'safe-occupancy' thresholds despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts, a key operational issue to address in preparing for future waves.},

Due to 5G/6G is based on new radio (NR) technology, the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) of radio services for heterogeneous IoT devices have been performed. The autonomous resource allocation and the intelligent quality of service class identity (IQCI) in mobile networks based on FL systems are obligated to meet the requirements of privacy constraints of IoT applications. In massive FL communications, the heterogeneous local devices propagate their local models and parameters over 5G/6G networks to the aggregation servers in edge cloud areas. Therefore, the assurance of network reliability is compulsory to facilitate end-to-end (E2E) reliability of FL communications and provide the satisfaction of model decisions. This paper proposed an intelligent lightweight scheme based on the reference software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to handle the massive FL communications between clients and aggregators to meet the mentioned perspectives. The handling method adjusts the model parameters and batches size of the individual client to reflect the apparent network conditions classified by the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The proposed system showed notable experimented metrics, including the E2E FL communication latency, throughput, system reliability, and model accuracy.},

Factors influencing triage decision-making are not easily captured within electronic health records. Natural language processing (NLP) and semantic technology can be used to integrate and interpret a variety of clinical data formats. We sought to identify factors affecting ICU admission decisions within clinician notes and determine the effect of these decisions on patient outcomes. Method(s): Physician logs of Medical ICU admission requests, which included clinical presentation and triage decisions, were prospectively collected over one year at an academic tertiary care center. Patient characteristics, University HealthSystems Consortium (UHC) expected mortality risk, and hospital courses were also captured. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we trained and evaluated an NLP-based fact extraction computer model to analyze data and recognize patterns within free-text descriptions stratified by the ICU admission decision (Accept vs. Reject). We examined triage decisions and patient outcomes of in-hospital mortality using Chi-square testing and multivariate regression. Result(s): 1160 requests for Medical ICU admission were logged, with 703 delineated as Accept and 457 as Reject, with a 14.8\% overall ICU-specific mortality. Both groups had similar mean UHC expected mortality risk indices (0.15 vs. 0.13, p=0.205). Those accepted were significantly younger in age (60.1 +/- 16.3 vs. 64.2 +/- 16.2 years, p{$<$}0.001), had shorter preceding inpatient lengths of stay (LOS) (mean 4.8 vs. 6.9 days, p=0.10), and more often had day-shift consults (58.5 vs. 41.5\%, p=0.004). Hospice was involved more often in Reject than Accept cases (15.0 vs. 11.8\%, p=0.010). Using 973 cases for the machine learning model, Reject cases more often had preexisting limitations on goals of care (60.0 vs. 29.3\%, p{$<$}0.001) or were considered to have poor prognosis by the ICU clinician (61.7 vs. 25.2\%, p{$<$}0.001). In the multivariate logistic model, older patient age, decompensation on hospital wards triggering consult, longer preceding LOS, and ICU clinician's concerns regarding prognosis were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality or hospice usage (all p{$<$}0.001, except age p=0.007). Conclusion(s): 60.6\% of patients requesting Medical ICU admission were accepted, though this decision did not significantly predict inpatient mortality or hospice utilization. Captured through NLP modeling, "likelihood to benefit" assessments significantly influenced triage decisions and were predictive of in-hospital mortality. NLP and semantic technologies can be used to identify patient factors contributing to prognosis and can prospectively provide decision support to ICU triage.},

  abstract = {Narcissism has been studied in relation to leadership and productivity in the workplace. However, few studies have been conducted on how narcissism influences work attitudes. The first goal of this study is to measure the association between narcissism and the five factor model (FFM) of personality in an organizational sample. The second goal is to measure the influence of narcissism on job satisfaction when controlling for FFM traits. A total of 224 employees from a public organization have filled out self-rating measures of job satisfaction, FFM traits and a measure of narcissism. Results indicated that narcissism was positively correlated with FFM extraversion and openness to experience and negatively correlated with agreeableness. Narcissism had a significant influence on job satisfaction, even when controlling for FFM traits. We believe that these results stress the importance of better understanding the role of narcissism in employee attitudes in order to weigh the pros and cons of hiring or promoting narcissistic employees.},

  abstract = {Background: The lack of access to mental health care could be addressed, in part, through the development of automated screening technologies for detecting the most common mental health disorders without the direct involvement of clinicians. Objective smartphone-collected data may contain sufficient information about individuals’ behaviors to infer their mental states and therefore screen for anxiety disorders and depression. Objective: The objective of this study is to compare how a single set of recognized and novel features, extracted from smartphone-collected data, can be used for predicting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and depression. Methods: An Android app was designed, together with a centralized server system, to collect periodic measurements of objective smartphone data. The types of data included samples of ambient audio, GPS location, screen state, and light sensor data. Subjects were recruited into a 2-week observational study in which the app was run on their personal smartphones. The subjects also completed self-report severity measures of SAD, GAD, and depression. The participants were 112 Canadian adults from a nonclinical population. High-level features were extracted from the data of 84 participants, and predictive models of SAD, GAD, and depression were built and evaluated. Results: Models of SAD and depression achieved a significantly greater screening accuracy than uninformative models (area under the receiver operating characteristic means of 0.64, SD 0.13 and 0.72, SD 0.12, respectively), whereas models of GAD failed to be predictive. Investigation of the model coefficients revealed key features that were predictive of SAD and depression. Conclusions: We demonstrate the ability of a common set of features to act as predictors in the models of both SAD and depression. This suggests that the types of behaviors that can be inferred from smartphone-collected data are broad indicators of mental health, which can be used to study, assess, and track psychopathology simultaneously across multiple disorders and diagnostic boundaries.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is heterogeneous in phenomenology, illness trajectory, and response to treatment. Despite evidence for the efficacy of multimodal-ity interventions, the majority of persons affected by this disorder do not achieve and sustain full syndromal recovery. It is eagerly anticipated that combining datasets across various information sources (e.g., hierarchical "multi-omic" measures, electronic health records), analyzed using advanced computational methods (e.g., machine learning), will inform future diagnosis and treatment selection. In the interim, identifying clinically meaningful subgroups of persons with the disorder having differential response to specific treatments at point-of-care is an empirical priority. This paper endeavours to synthesize salient domains in the clinical characterization of the adult patient with bipolar disorder, with the overarching aim to improve health outcomes by informing patient management and treatment considerations. Extant data indicate that characterizing select domains in bipolar disorder provides actionable information and guides shared decision making. For example, it is robustly established that the presence of mixed features - especially during depressive episodes - and of physical and psychiatric comorbidities informs illness trajectory, response to treatment, and suicide risk. In addition, early environmental exposures (e.g., sexual and physical abuse, emotional neglect) are highly associated with more complicated illness presentations, inviting the need for developmentally-oriented and integrated treatment approaches. There have been significant advances in validating subtypes of bipolar disorder (e.g., bipolar I vs. II disorder), particularly in regard to pharmacological interventions. As with other severe mental disorders, social functioning, interpersonal/family relationships and internalized stigma are domains highly relevant to relapse risk, health outcomes, and quality of life. The elevated standardized mortality ratio for completed suicide and suicidal behaviour in bipolar disorder invites the need for characterization of this domain in all patients. The framework of this paper is to describe all the above salient domains, providing a synthesis of extant literature and recommendations for decision support tools and clinical metrics that can be implemented at point-of-care.Copyright © 2022 World Psychiatric Association.},

The concordance of augmented intelligence systems with best medical practices and potential influences on physician behavior remain unknown. Method(s): Electronic health records from 88 breast cancer patients evaluated at a USA tertiary care center were presented to subspecialist experts and oncologists focusing on other disease states with and without reviewing the IBM Watson for Oncology with Cota RWE platform. Result(s): The cognitive computing "recommended" option was concordant with selection by breast cancer experts in 78.5\% and "for consideration" option was selected in 9.4\%, yielding agreements in 87.9\%. Fifty-nine percent of non-concordant responses were generated from 8\% of cases. In the Cota observational database 69.3\% of matched controls were treated with "recommended," 11.4\% "for consideration", and 19.3\% "not recommended." Without guidance from Watson for Oncology (WfO)/Cota RWE, novice oncologists chose 75.5\% recommended/for consideration treatments which improved to 95.3\% with WfO/Cota RWE. The novices were more likely than experts to choose a non-recommended option (P {$<$}.01) without WfO/Cota RWE and changed decisions in 39\% cases. Conclusion(s): Watson for Oncology with Cota RWE options were largely concordant with disease expert judged best oncology practices, and was able to improve treatment decisions among breast cancer novices. The observation that nearly a fifth of patients with similar disease characteristics received non-recommended options in a real world database highlights a need for decision support.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

  abstract = {The combination of point-of-care (POC) medical microdevices and machine learning has the potential transform the practice of medicine. In this area, scalable lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices have many advantages over standard laboratory methods, including faster analysis, reduced cost, lower power consumption, and higher levels of integration and automation. Despite significant advances in LOC technologies over the years, several remaining obstacles are preventing clinical implementation and market penetration of these novel medical microdevices. Similarly, while machine learning has seen explosive growth in recent years and promises to shift the practice of medicine toward data-intensive and evidence-based decision making, its uptake has been hindered due to the lack of integration between clinical measurements and disease determinations. In this Account, we describe recent developments in the programmable bio-nanochip (p-BNC) system, a biosensor platform with the capacity for learning. The p-BNC is a "platform to digitize biology" in which small quantities of patient sample generate immunofluorescent signal on agarose bead sensors that is optically extracted and converted to antigen concentrations. The platform comprises disposable microfluidic cartridges, a portable analyzer, automated data analysis software, and intuitive mobile health interfaces. The single-use cartridges are fully integrated, self-contained microfluidic devices containing aqueous buffers conveniently embedded for POC use. A novel fluid delivery method was developed to provide accurate and repeatable flow rates via actuation of the cartridge's blister packs. A portable analyzer instrument was designed to integrate fluid delivery, optical detection, image analysis, and user interface, representing a universal system for acquiring, processing, and managing clinical data while overcoming many of the challenges facing the widespread clinical adoption of LOC technologies. We demonstrate the p-BNC's flexibility through the completion of multiplex assays within the single-use disposable cartridges for three clinical applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction. Toward the goal of creating "sensors that learn", we have developed and describe here the Cardiac ScoreCard, a clinical decision support system for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The Cardiac ScoreCard approach comprises a comprehensive biomarker panel and risk factor information in a predictive model capable of assessing early risk and late-stage disease progression for heart attack and heart failure patients. These marker-driven tests have the potential to radically reduce costs, decrease wait times, and introduce new options for patients needing regular health monitoring. Further, these efforts demonstrate the clinical utility of fusing data from information-rich biomarkers and the Internet of Things (IoT) using predictive analytics to generate single-index assessments for wellness/illness status. By promoting disease prevention and personalized wellness management, tools of this nature have the potential to improve health care exponentially.},

Design/methodology/approach A literature review on service innovation, detected in terms of value co-creation, and service ecosystem, investigated in terms of well-being, is drawn. To analyze the implications of service innovation on a H-SES well-being, through the technology acceptance degree and predisposition to use by actors, a case study based on TAM-model 3 determinants as categories is carried out. Findings AI-based service innovation archetypes in healthcare may be considered as antecedents of the service ecosystem well-being conditions as long as they enable actors to co-create value. To make it possible, a patient-driven service innovation is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of its inactivity due to fears in terms of transparency. Originality/value Service innovation and service ecosystem well-being may be studied in an integrated way, with a multidisciplinary approach, and are linked by value co-creation, because only thanks a patient-driven service innovation is possible to foster service ecosystem well-being in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36\% female, 29\% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8\% (95\% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3\%–88.8\%) and NPV was 98.3\% (90.6\%–100\%). For the 31.8\% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4\% (91.6\%–100\%) and specificity was 78.9\% (67.6\%–87.7\%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6\% (63/122) (95\% CI 42.4\%, 60.8\%), and specificity would fall to 18.5\% (56/303) (95\% CI 14.3\%, 23.3\%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91\% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources.},

In addition, factors such as an approaching worldwide pandemic have limited the amount of physical contact that people can have. So as a result, the use of service robots in service areas, such as tourism, has recently become controversial. In this study, accommodation customers' perceptions of advantages and disadvantages about robots and the effect of the perceived value of their intention to use them were investigated. Within the scope of the research, data were collected from 1408 people living in various cities in Turkey through an online survey. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. As a result of the analyses, it was found that the perception of advantage and the perceived value affect the intention to use service robots positively and significantly. It has been determined that the perception of disadvantage affects the intention to use service robots negatively and significantly. The research results show that the accommodation companies should be innovative and rapidly transition to robotization, as in the manufacturing industry. Advanced technological innovation applications, such as service robots, will play an essential role in the revival of the tourism industry, especially during the global epidemic.},

  abstract = {Mice have been increasingly used as preclinical model to elucidate mechanisms and test therapeutics for treating intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Several intervertebral disc (IVD) histological scoring systems have been proposed, but none exists that reliably quantitate mouse disc pathologies. Here, we report a new robust quantitative mouse IVD histopathological scoring system developed by building consensus from the spine community analyses of previous scoring systems and features noted on different mouse models of IDD. The new scoring system analyzes 14 key histopathological features from nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus (AF), endplate (EP), and AF/NP/EP interface regions. Each feature is categorized and scored; hence, the weight for quantifying the disc histopathology is equally distributed and not driven by only a few features. We tested the new histopathological scoring criteria using images of lumbar and coccygeal discs from different IDD models of both sexes, including genetic, needle-punctured, static compressive models, and natural aging mice spanning neonatal to old age stages. Moreover, disc sections from common histological preparation techniques and stains including H\&E, SafraninO/Fast green, and FAST were analyzed to enable better cross-study comparisons. Fleiss's multi-rater agreement test shows significant agreement by both experienced and novice multiple raters for all 14 features on several mouse models and sections prepared using various histological techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of the new scoring system was validated using artificial intelligence and supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis. Finally, we applied the new scoring system on established disc degeneration models and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of histopathological scoring changes. Overall, the new histopathological scoring system offers the ability to quantify histological changes in mouse models of disc degeneration and regeneration with high sensitivity and specificity.},

The surface UHI (SUHI) is typically monitored with remote sensing products, whereas the air UHI (AUHI) is typically monitored using temperature sensor networks. The first technique requires clear days to obtain good images, and the latter is limited by the number of weather stations in an urban and rural area. An alternative to monitor the AUHI is the usage of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data which is available in all weather conditions and there are well-developed GNSS receiver networks around the world. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimating the air temperature from GNSS data to take advantage of the quantity of data. By training a support vector regressor with three datasets, GNSS-derived zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD), temperature, and day-of-the year, we can estimate temperature from GNSS data without the need for other environmental variables. The regressor presented in this article is trained with data from 2016 to 2019 and tested with data from 2020 in five Japanese metropolitan areas. The results show that it is possible to predict temperature from only the ZTD of GNSS signals with high precision, as an R-2 between 0.82 and 0.90 is found for the predictions. Predicted temperatures are then used to study the diurnal cycle of the AUHI in Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka-Kyoto, and Fukuoka with an average precision of 0.8 degrees C.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing demand for artificial intelligence research in medicine, the functionalities of his methods in health emergency remain unclear. Therefore, the authors have conducted this systematic review and a global overview study which aims to identify, analyse, and evaluate the research available on different platforms, and its implementations in healthcare emergencies. The methodology applied for the identification and selection of the scientific studies and the different applications consist of two methods. On the one hand, the PRISMA methodology was carried out in Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed ScienceDirect, and Scopus. On the other hand, a review of commercial applications found in the best-known commercial platforms (Android and iOS). A total of 20 studies were included in this review. Most of the included studies were of clinical decisions (n = 4, 20\%) or medical services or emergency services (n = 4, 20\%). Only 2 were focused on m-health (n = 2, 10\%). On the other hand, 12 apps were chosen for full testing on different devices. These apps dealt with pre-hospital medical care (n = 3, 25\%) or clinical decision support (n = 3, 25\%). In total, half of these apps are based on machine learning based on natural language processing. Machine learning is increasingly applicable to healthcare and offers solutions to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare. With the emergence of mobile health devices and applications that can use data and assess a patient's real-time health, machine learning is a growing trend in the healthcare industry.

  abstract = {Radiologists are expected to expediently communicate critical and unexpected findings to referring clinicians to prevent delayed diagnosis and treatment of patients. However, competing demands such as heavy workload along with lack of administrative support resulted in communication failures that accounted for 7\% of the malpractice payments made from 2004 to 2008 in the United States. To address this problem, we have developed a novel machine learning method that can automatically and accurately identify cases that require prompt communication to referring physicians based on analyzing the associated radiology reports. This semi-supervised learning approach requires a minimal amount of manual annotations and was trained on a large multi-institutional radiology report repository from three major external healthcare organizations. To test our approach, we created a corpus of 480 radiology reports from our own institution and double-annotated cases that required prompt communication by two radiologists. Our evaluation on the test corpus achieved an F-score of 74.5\% and recall of 90.0\% in identifying cases for prompt communication. The implementation of the proposed approach as part of an online decision support system can assist radiologists in identifying radiological cases for prompt communication to referring physicians to avoid or minimize potential harm to patients.

  abstract = {In this paper we present the application of the inductive database approach to two practical analytical case studies: Web usage mining in Web logs and financial data. As far as concerns the Web domain, we have considered the enriched XML Web logs, that we call conceptual logs, produced by specific Web applications. These ones have been built by using a conceptual model, namely WebML, and its accompanying CASE tool, WebRatio. The Web conceptual logs integrate the usual information about user requests with meta-data concerning the Web site structure. As far as concerns the analysis of financial data, we have considered the trade stock exchange index Dow Jones and studied its component stocks from 1997 to 2002 using the so-called technical analysis. Technical analysis consists in the identification of the relevant (graphical) patterns that occur in the plot of evolution of a stock quote as time proceeds, often adopting different time granularities. On the plots the correlations between distinctive variables of the stocks quote are pointed out, such as the quote trend, the percentage variation and the volume of the stocks exchanged. In particular we adopted candle-sticks, a figurative pattern representing in a condensed diagram the evolution of the stock quotes in a daily stock exchange. In technical analysis, candle-sticks have been frequently used by practitioners to predict the trend of the stocks quotes in the market. We then apply a data mining language, namely MINE RULE, to these data in order to identify different types of patterns. As far as Web data is concerned, recurrent navigation paths, page contents most frequently visited, and anomalies such as intrusion attempts or a harmful usage of the resources are among the most important patterns. As far as concerns the financial domain, we searched for the sets of stocks which frequently exhibited a positive daily exchange in the same days, so as to constitute a collection of quotes for the constitution of the customers' portfolio, or the candle-sticks frequently associated to certain stocks, or finally the most similar stocks, in the sense that they mostly presented in the same dates the same typology of candle-stick, that is the same behaviour in time. The purpose of this paper is to show that the exploitation of the nuggets of information embedded in the data and of the specialised mining constructs provided by the query languages, enables the rapid customization of the mining procedures following to the users' need. Given our experience, we also claim that the use of queries in advanced languages, as opposed to ad-hoc heuristics, eases the specification and the discovery of a large spectrum of patterns.},

  abstract = {In metal forming, the plastic behavior of metallic alloys is directly related to their formability, and it has been traditionally characterized by simplified models of the flow curves, especially in the analysis by finite element simulation and analytical methods. Tools based on artificial neural networks have shown high potential for predicting the behavior and properties of industrial components. Aluminum alloys are among the most broadly used materials in challenging industries such as aerospace, automotive, or food packaging. In this study, a computer-aided tool is developed to predict two of the most useful mechanical properties of metallic materials to characterize the plastic behavior, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. These prognostics are based on the alloy chemical composition, tempers, and Brinell hardness. In this study, a material database is employed to train an artificial neural network that is able to make predictions with a confidence greater than 95\%. It is also shown that this methodology achieves a performance similar to that of empirical equations developed expressly for a specific material, but it provides greater generality since it can approximate the properties of any aluminum alloy. The methodology is based on the usage of artificial neural networks supported by a big data collection about the properties of thousands of commercial materials. Thus, the input data go above 2000 entries. When the relevant information has been collected and organized, an artificial neural network is defined, and after the training, the artificial intelligence is able to make predictions about the material properties with an average confidence greater than 95\%.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Manual clinical scoring systems are the current standard used for acute asthma clinical care pathways. No automated system exists that assesses disease severity, time course, and treatment impact in pediatric acute severe asthma exacerbations., WORKING HYPOTHESIS: machine learning applied to continuous vital sign data could provide a novel pediatric-automated asthma respiratory score (pARS) by using the manual pediatric asthma score (PAS) as the clinical care standard., METHODS: Continuous vital sign monitoring data (heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry) were merged with the health record data including a provider-determined PAS in children between 2 and 18 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for status asthmaticus. A cascaded artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to create an automated respiratory score and validated by two approaches. The ANN was compared with the Normal and Poisson regression models., RESULTS: Out of an initial group of 186 patients, 128 patients met inclusion criteria. Merging physiologic data with clinical data yielded {$>$}37 000 data points for model training. The pARS score had good predictive accuracy, with 80\% of the pARS values within +/-2 points of the provider-determined PAS, especially over the mid-range of PASs (6-9). The Poisson and Normal distribution regressions yielded a smaller overall median absolute error., CONCLUSIONS: The pARS reproduced the manually recorded PAS. Once validated and studied prospectively as a tool for research and for physician decision support, this methodology can be implemented in the PICU to objectively guide treatment decisions.

  abstract = {Background: Patients are increasingly seeking Web-based symptom checkers to obtain diagnoses. However, little is known about the characteristics of the patients who use these resources, their rationale for use, and whether they find them accurate and useful. Objective(s): The study aimed to examine patients' experiences using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted online symptom checker. Method(s): An online survey was administered between March 2, 2018, through March 15, 2018, to US users of the Isabel Symptom Checker within 6 months of their use. User characteristics, experiences of symptom checker use, experiences discussing results with physicians, and prior personal history of experiencing a diagnostic error were collected. Result(s): A total of 329 usable responses was obtained. The mean respondent age was 48.0 (SD 16.7) years; most were women (230/304, 75.7\%) and white (271/304, 89.1\%). Patients most commonly used the symptom checker to better understand the causes of their symptoms (232/304, 76.3\%), followed by for deciding whether to seek care (101/304, 33.2\%) or where (eg, primary or urgent care: 63/304, 20.7\%), obtaining medical advice without going to a doctor (48/304, 15.8\%), and understanding their diagnoses better (39/304, 12.8\%). Most patients reported receiving useful information for their health problems (274/304, 90.1\%), with half reporting positive health effects (154/302, 51.0\%). Most patients perceived it to be useful as a diagnostic tool (253/301, 84.1\%), as a tool providing insights leading them closer to correct diagnoses (231/303, 76.2\%), and reported they would use it again (278/304, 91.4\%). Patients who discussed findings with their physicians (103/213, 48.4\%) more often felt physicians were interested (42/103, 40.8\%) than not interested in learning about the tool's results (24/103, 23.3\%) and more often felt physicians were open (62/103, 60.2\%) than not open (21/103, 20.4\%) to discussing the results. Compared with patients who had not previously experienced diagnostic errors (missed or delayed diagnoses: 123/304, 40.5\%), patients who had previously experienced diagnostic errors (181/304, 59.5\%) were more likely to use the symptom checker to determine where they should seek care (15/123, 12.2\% vs 48/181, 26.5\%; P=.002), but they less often felt that physicians were interested in discussing the tool's results (20/34, 59\% vs 22/69, 32\%; P=.04). Conclusion(s): Despite ongoing concerns about symptom checker accuracy, a large patient-user group perceived an AI-assisted symptom checker as useful for diagnosis. Formal validation studies evaluating symptom checker accuracy and effectiveness in real-world practice could provide additional useful information about their benefit.Copyright © 2020 Ashley N D Meyer, Traber D Giardina, Christiane Spitzmueller, Umber Shahid, Taylor M T Scott, Hardeep Singh.},

The recent success of precision medicine in non-critical care settings has resulted from the confluence of large clinical and biospecimen repositories, innovative bioinformatics, and novel trial designs. Similar advances for precision medicine in sepsis and in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are possible but will require further investigation and significant investment in infrastructure. Method(s): This project was funded by the American Thoracic Society Board of Directors. A multidisciplinary and diverse working group reviewed the available literature, established a conceptual framework, and iteratively developed recommendations for the Precision Medicine Research Agenda for Sepsis and ARDS. Result(s): The following six priority recommendations were developed by the working group: 1) the creation of large richly phenotyped and harmonized knowledge networks of clinical, imaging, and multianalyte molecular data for sepsis and ARDS; 2) the implementation of novel trial designs, including adaptive designs, and embedding trial procedures in the electronic health record; 3) continued innovation in the data science and engineering methods required to identify heterogeneity of treatment effect; 4) further development of the tools necessary for the real-time application of precision medicine approaches; 5) work to ensure that precision medicine strategies are applicable and available to a broad range of patients varying across differing racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and demographic groups; and 6) the securement and maintenance of adequate and sustainable funding for precision medicine efforts. Conclusion(s): Precision medicine approaches that incorporate variability in genomic, biologic, and environmental factors may provide a path forward for better individualizing the delivery of therapies and improving care for patients with sepsis and ARDS.Copyright © 2021 by the American Thoracic Society.},

Although assimilation of AI into the specialty has occurred more slowly than predicted, developments in machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks suggest that technologic hurdles and costs will eventually be overcome. However, beyond these technologic hurdles, formidable legal hurdles threaten the impact of AI on the specialty. Legal liability for errors committed by AI will influence the ultimate role of AI within radiology and also influence whether AI remains a simple decision support tool or develops into an autonomous member of the health care team. Additional areas of uncertainty include the potential application of products liability law to AI and the approach taken by the U.S. FDA in potentially classifying autonomous AI as a medical device. The current ambiguity of the legal treatment of AI will profoundly influence development of autonomous AI given that vendors, radiologists, and hospitals will be unable to reliably assess their liability associated with implementing such tools. Advocates of AI in radiology and health care in general need to lobby for legislative action to better clarify the liability risks of AI in a way that does not deter technologic development.},

Key advances in structuring and encoding standardized data with an increased availability of data, development of knowledge bases for CDS, and improvement of capabilities to share knowledge artifacts, explosion of methods analyzing and inferring from clinical data, evolution of information technologies and architectures to facilitate the broad application of CDS, improvement of methods to implement CDS and integrate CDS into the clinical workflow, and increasing sophistication of the end-user, all have played a role in improving the effective use of CDS in healthcare delivery., CONCLUSION: CDS has evolved dramatically over the past 25 years and will likely evolve just as dramatically or more so over the next 25 years. Increasingly, the clinical encounter between a clinician and a patient will be supported by a wide variety of cognitive aides to support diagnosis, treatment, care-coordination, surveillance and prevention, and health maintenance or wellness.},

  abstract = {Computer science advances and ultra-fast computing speeds find artificial intelligence (AI) broadly benefitting modern society—forecasting weather, recognizing faces, detecting fraud, and deciphering genomics. AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100\%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.},

  abstract = {The aim of the article is to propose a conceptual framework, constructs, and conjectures to act as a guide for future, related research finalized to design and implement versions of Artificial Intelligence encompassing an artificially simulated unconscious suitable for human-like artificial cognitive processing. This article considers the concept of the unconscious in psychoanalysis. The interdisciplinary understanding of this concept is considered to be the unavoidable property of sufficiently complex, cognitive processing. We elaborate on the possibility of an artificial unconscious, able to both self-acquired properties through usage, and self-profile through a supposed implicit, parasitic usage of explicit cognitive processing. Memory activities are considered to be integrated into cognitive processing, with memory no longer only being storage and reminding no longer only being finding. We elaborate on the artificial unconscious as an implicit, usage-dependent, self-profiling, and emergent process. Conceptual characteristics of the research project are the implementation of weighted networked, fuzzified memorizations; self-generated networks of links of inter-relationships as nodes, self-variation of the intensity of the links according to the use, and activation of internal self-processes such as the introduction of fictitious links intended as variations and combinations of the current ones. Application examples suitable for experimental implementation are also discussed with reference to chatbot technology that has been extended with features of an artificial unconscious. Thus, we introduce the concept of the AU-chatbot. The main purpose is to allow the artificial cognitive processing to acquire suitable human-like attitudes in representing, interfacing, and learning, potentially important in supporting and complementing human-centered activities. Examples of expected features are the ability to combine current and unconscious links to perform cognitive processing such as representing, deciding, memorizing, and solving equivalencies, and also learning meta-profiles, such as in supporting doctor-patient interactions and educational activities. We also discuss possible technologies suitable for implementing experiments for the artificial unconscious.},

To increase the explainability of the existing AI methods, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is proposed. We performed a systematic literature review, based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters, of studies that applied XAI methods in X-ray-image-related tasks. We identified 141 studies relevant to the objective of this research from five different databases. For each of these studies, we assessed the quality and then analyzed them according to a specific set of research questions. We determined two primary purposes for X-ray images: the detection of bone diseases and lung diseases. We found that most of the AI methods used were based on a CNN. We identified the different techniques to increase the explainability of the models and grouped them depending on the kind of explainability obtained. We found that most of the articles did not evaluate the quality of the explainability obtained, causing problems of confidence in the explanation. Finally, we identified the current challenges and future directions of this subject and provide guidelines to practitioners and researchers to improve the limitations and the weaknesses that we detected.},

We present a framework coalescing multiple deep methods and corresponding models as responses to specific Big Data challenges. First, we perform a detailed per-challenge review of existing techniques, with benchmarks and usage advice, and subsequently synthesize them together into one organic construct that we discover principally uses extensions of one underlying model, the autoencoder. This work therefore provides a synthesis where challenges at scale across the Vs of Big Data could be addressed by new algorithms and architectures being proposed in the deep learning community.

Most predictive algorithms requiring pathway implementations are evaluated using metrics focused on predictive performance, such as the c statistic. However, these metrics are of limited clinical value, for two reasons: (1) they do not account for the algorithm's role within a provider workflow; and (2) they do not quantify the algorithm's value in terms of patient outcomes and cost savings. We propose a model for simulating the selection of patients over time by a clinician using a machine learning algorithm, and quantifying the expected patient outcomes and cost savings. Using data on unplanned emergency department surgical readmissions, we show that factors such as the provider's schedule and postoperative prediction timing can have major effects on the pathway cohort size and potential cost reductions from preventing hospital readmissions.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

In the past, static prediction models were developed using baseline (eg, preoperative) data to evaluate AKI risk. Newer models which incorporated baseline as well as evolving data collected during a hospital admission have shown improved predicative abilities. In this review, we will summarize the advances made in AKI risk prediction over the last several years, including a shift toward more dynamic, real-time, electronic medical record-based models. In addition, we will be discussing the role of electronic AKI alerts and decision support tools. Recent studies have demonstrated improved patient outcomes through the use of these tools which monitor for nephrotoxin medication exposures as well as provide kidney focused care bundles for patients at high risk for severe AKI. Finally, we will briefly discuss the pitfalls and implications of implementing these scores, alerts, and support tools. Copyright © 2021 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is encouraging to see a substantial increase in individuals surviving cancer. Even more so since most of them will have a positive effect on society by returning to work. However, many cancer survivors have unmet needs, especially when it comes to improving their quality of life (QoL). Only few survivors are able to meet all of the recommendations regarding well-being and there is a body of evidence that cancer survivors' needs often remain neglected from health policy and national cancer control plans. This increases the impact of inequalities in cancer care and adds a dangerous component to it. The inequalities affect the individual survivor, their career, along with their relatives and society as a whole. The current study will evaluate the impact of the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on the self-efficacy of participants following intervention supported by digital tools. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of the impact of patient trajectories (from retrospective data) and patient gathered health data on prediction and improved intervention against possible secondary disease or negative outcomes (e.g. late toxicities, fatal events)., METHODS/DESIGN: The study is designed as a single-case experimental prospective study where each individual serves as its own control group with basal measurements obtained at the recruitment and subsequent measurements performed every 6 months during follow ups. The measurement will involve CASE-cancer, Patient Activation Measure and System Usability Scale. The study will involve 160 survivors (80 survivors of Breast Cancer and 80 survivors of Colorectal Cancer) from four countries, Belgium, Latvia, Slovenia, and Spain. The intervention will be implemented via a digital tool (mHealthApplication), collecting objective biomarkers (vital signs) and subjective biomarkers (PROs) with the support of a (embodied) conversational agent. Additionally, the Clinical Decision Support system (CDSS), including visualization of cohorts and trajectories will enable oncologists to personalize treatment for an efficient care plan and follow-up management., DISCUSSION: We expect that cancer survivors will significantly increase their self-efficacy following the personalized intervention supported by the m-HealthApplication compared to control measurements at recruitment. We expect to observe improvement in healthy habits, disease self-management and self-perceived QoL. Trial registration ISRCTN97617326. https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN97617326 .

Acquisition and validation methods The library was developed under local ethics committee approval. Projection and image data from 299 clinically performed patient CT exams were archived for three types of clinical exams: noncontrast head CT scans acquired for acute cognitive or motor deficit, low-dose noncontrast chest scans acquired to screen high-risk patients for pulmonary nodules, and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen acquired to look for metastatic liver lesions. Scans were performed on CT systems from two different CT manufacturers using routine clinical protocols. Projection data were validated by reconstructing the data using several different reconstruction algorithms and through use of the data in the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Reduced dose projection data were simulated for each scan using a validated noise insertion method. Radiologists marked location and diagnosis for detected pathologies. Reference truth was obtained from the patient medical record, either from histology or subsequent imaging. Data format and usage notes Projection datasets were converted into the previously developed DICOM-CT-PD format, which is an extended DICOM format created to store CT projections and acquisition geometry in a nonproprietary format. Image data are stored in the standard DICOM image format and clinical data in a spreadsheet. Materials are provided to help investigators use the DICOM-CT-PD files, including a dictionary file, data reader and user manual. The library is publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (). Potential applications This CT data library will facilitate the development and validation of new CT reconstruction and/or denoising algorithms, including those associated with machine learning or artificial intelligence.

This approach can be applied in multiple ways to formalize the understanding of the systems, to support the synthesis of the design in the development of a new product, or to support the analysis and improvement of existing systems incrementally. The type of usage depends on the objectives that are targeted. The objectives can be categorized into two key groups: discovering a totally new solution, or improving an existing one. This article proposes to use the functional modeling approach to achieve three goals: to support the representation of physics-based reasoning, to use this physics-based reasoning to assess design options, and finally to support innovative ideation. The exemplification of the function-based approach is presented via a case study of a glue gun proposed for this Special Issue. A reverse engineering approach is applied, and the authors seek an incremental improvement of the solution. As the physics-based reasoning model presented in this article is heavily dependent on the quality of the functional model, the authors propose a general approach to limit the interpretability of the functional representations by mapping the functional vocabulary with elementary structural blocks derived from bond graph theory. The physics-based reasoning approach is supported by a mathematical framework that is summarized in the article. The physics-based reasoning model is used for discovering the limitations of solutions in the form of internal contradictions and guiding the design ideation effort.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The critical nature of patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) demands intensive monitoring of their vital signs as well as highly qualified professional assistance. The combination of these needs makes ICUs very expensive, which requires investment to be prioritized. Administrative issues emerge, and health institutions face dilemmas such as: "How many beds should an ICU provide to serve the population, at the lowest costs" and "Which is the most critical body information to monitor in an ICU?". Due to financial and ethical implications, these judgments require technical and precise knowledge. Decisions have usually relied on clinical scores, like the APACHE (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation) and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores, which are imprecise and outdated. The popularization of machine learning techniques has shed some light on the topic as a way to renew score purposes. In 2012, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology launched the Challenge - ICU Patients. This Challenge aimed to stimulate the development of techniques to predict mortality in ICUs. Based on biometric and physiological features collected from patients, the participants predicted the patient's death risk by using their classifiers. Several participants achieved results that were better than the results produced by the SOFA and the APACHE scores; the prediction levels were =54\%, which is weak., OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigate the reasons that led to these results as a means to ground our solution. Then, we propose alternative practices in an attempt to improve the results. Our main goal is to improve the prediction of mortality in ICUs by using the same data employed during the 2012 PhysioNet Challenge. Our specific objectives are (i) to simplify the problem by reducing the dimensionality; (ii) to reduce the uncontrolled variance, and (iii) to make classifiers less dependent on the training set., METHODS: Accordingly, we propose a methodology based on extensive steps, including sample filter and data normalization. To select features and to reduce the intra-group variance, we employ multivariate data analysis by using Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Spectral Clustering, and Tukey's HSD Test, recursively. After that, we use machine learning techniques to create classifiers according to different methods. We evaluate our results with the same metrics proposed by the 2012 PhysioNet Challenge., RESULTS: For classifiers constructed and tested by using independent datasets, our best classifier was a linear SVM, which provided results of =0.73. These results were significantly better than the =0.54 achieved in previous work at {$>$}99\% confidence interval. Furthermore, our approach only demanded twelve features, which was consistently smaller than the number of features required by the previous approaches., CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that our approach presented: (a) higher performance to predict death risks (+20\%); (b) smaller dependence on the training set; and (c) lower costs for ICU monitoring (few features). Besides the better prediction power, our approach also demanded lower costs for implementation and a more extensive range of potential ICUs. Future studies should employ our proposal to investigate the possibility of including some physiological features that were not available for the 2012 PhysioNet Challenge.

  abstract = {Background: In the recent years, machine learning algorithms have been more widely and increasingly applied in biomedical fields. In particular, their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry, for instance, as diagnostic tests/tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, given their complexity and potential clinical implications, there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy. Objective: This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence for the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing ASD. Methods: The following databases were searched on November 28, 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), PsycINFO, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library. Studies that used a machine learning algorithm partially or fully for distinguishing individuals with ASD from control subjects and provided accuracy measures were included in our analysis. The bivariate random effects model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was used to investigate and resolve the source of heterogeneity between studies. True-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values from individual studies were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity values, draw Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and obtain the area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC). Results: A total of 43 studies were included for the final analysis, of which a meta-analysis was performed on 40 studies (53 samples with 12,128 participants). A structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) subgroup meta-analysis (12 samples with 1776 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.76-0.89), a specificity of 0.84 (95\% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC of 0.90/0.83. A functional magnetic resonance imaging/deep neural network subgroup meta-analysis (5 samples with 1345 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95\% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67. Conclusions: The accuracy of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of ASD was considered acceptable by few accuracy measures only in cases of sMRI use; however, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning algorithms to clinical settings.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the importance of time to endovascular therapy (EVT) in clinical outcomes in large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke. Delays to treatment are particularly prevalent when patients require a transfer from hospitals without EVT capability onsite. A computer-aided triage system, Viz LVO, has the potential to streamline workflows. This platform includes an image viewer, a communication system, and an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that automatically identifies suspected LVO strokes on CTA imaging and rapidly triggers alerts. We hypothesize that the Viz application will decrease time-to-treatment, leading to improved clinical outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was assessed for patients who presented to a stroke center currently utilizing Viz LVO and underwent EVT following transfer for LVO stroke between July 2018 and March 2020. Time intervals and clinical outcomes were compared for 55 patients divided into pre- and post-Viz cohorts., RESULTS: The median initial door-to-neuroendovascular team (NT) notification time interval was significantly faster (25.0 min [IQR = 12.0] vs. 40.0 min [IQR = 61.0]; p = 0.01) with less variation (p {$<$} 0.05) following Viz LVO implementation. The median initial door-to-skin puncture time interval was 25 min shorter in the post-Viz cohort, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.15)., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results have shown that Viz LVO implementation is associated with earlier, more consistent NT notification times. This application can serve as an early warning system and a failsafe to ensure that no LVO is left behind. Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become widespread due to the advanced technologies and availability of digital data. Supervised learning algorithms have shown human-level performance or even better and are better feature extractor-quantifier than unsupervised learning algorithms. To get huge dataset with good quality control, there is a need of an annotation tool with a customizable feature set. This paper evaluates the viability of having an in house annotation tool which works on a smartphone and can be used in a healthcare setting. Methods: We developed a smartphone-based grading system to help researchers in grading multiple retinal fundi. The process consisted of designing the flow of user interface (UI) keeping in view feedback from experts. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of change in speed of a grader over time and feature usage statistics was done. The dataset size was approximately 16,000 images with adjudicated labels by a minimum of 2 doctors. Results for an AI model trained on the images graded using this tool and its validation over some public datasets were prepared. Results: We created a DL model and analysed its performance for a binary referrable DR Classification task, whether a retinal image has Referrable DR or not. A total of 32 doctors used the tool for minimum of 20 images each. Data analytics suggested significant portability and flexibility of the tool. Grader variability for images was in favour of agreement on images annotated. Number of images used to assess agreement is 550. Mean of 75.9\% was seen in agreement. Conclusion: Our aim was to make Annotation of Medical imaging easier and to minimize time taken for annotations without quality degradation. The user feedback and feature usage statistics confirm our hypotheses of incorporation of brightness and contrast variations, green channels and zooming add-ons in correlation to certain disease types. Simulation of multiple review cycles and establishing quality control can boost the accuracy of AI models even further. Although our study aims at developing an annotation tool for diagnosing and classifying diabetic retinopathy fundus images but same concept can be used for fundus images of other ocular diseases as well as other streams of medical science such as radiology where image-based diagnostic applications are utilised.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the increasing availability of omics data, due to both the advancements in the acquisition of molecular biology results and in systems biology simulation technologies, provides the bases for precision medicine. Success in precision medicine depends on the access to healthcare and biomedical data. To this end, the digitization of all clinical exams and medical records is becoming a standard in hospitals. The digitization is essential to collect, share, and aggregate large volumes of heterogeneous data to support the discovery of hidden patterns with the aim to define predictive models for biomedical purposes. Patients' data sharing is a critical process. In fact, it raises ethical, social, legal, and technological issues that must be properly addressed., RESULTS: In this work, we present an infrastructure devised to deal with the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous biological data. The infrastructure was applied to the data collected between 2010-2016 in one of the major diagnostic analysis laboratories in Italy. Data from three different platforms were collected (i.e., laboratory exams, pathological anatomy exams, biopsy exams). The infrastructure has been designed to allow the extraction and aggregation of both unstructured and semi-structured data. Data are properly treated to ensure data security and privacy. Specialized algorithms have also been implemented to process the aggregated information with the aim to obtain a precise historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. Moreover, three Bayesian classifiers have been developed to analyze examinations reported as free text. Experimental results show that the classifiers exhibit a good accuracy when used to analyze sentences related to the sample location, diseases presence and status of the illnesses., CONCLUSIONS: The infrastructure allows the integration of multiple and heterogeneous sources of anonymized data from the different clinical platforms. Both unstructured and semi-structured data are processed to obtain a precise historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. Data aggregation allows to perform a series of statistical assessments required to answer complex questions that can be used in a variety of fields, such as predictive and precision medicine. In particular, studying the clinical history of patients that have developed similar pathologies can help to predict or individuate markers able to allow an early diagnosis of possible illnesses.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives: The multiple chest x-ray datasets released in the last years have ground-truth labels intended for different computer vision tasks, suggesting that performance in automated chest x-ray interpretation might improve by using a method that can exploit diverse types of annotations. This work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test data. We focused on obtaining a clinically useful tool that could be successfully integrated into a hospital workflow. Material(s) and Method(s): Based on expert opinion, we selected four target chest x-ray findings, namely lung opacities, fractures, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. For each finding we defined the most suitable type of ground-truth label, and built four training datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our institutional archive. We trained four different Deep Learning architectures and combined their outputs with a late fusion strategy, obtaining a unified tool. The performance was measured on two test datasets: an external openly-available dataset, and a retrospective institutional dataset, to estimate performance on the local population. Result(s): The external and local test sets had 4376 and 1064 images, respectively, for which the model showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.75 (95\%CI: 0.74-0.76) and 0.87 (95\%CI: 0.86-0.89) in the detection of abnormal chest x-rays. For the local population, a sensitivity of 86\% (95\%CI: 84-90), and a specificity of 88\% (95\%CI: 86-90) were obtained, with no significant differences between demographic subgroups. We present examples of heatmaps to show the accomplished level of interpretability, examining true and false positives. Conclusion(s): This study presents a new approach for exploiting heterogeneous labels from different chest x-ray datasets, by choosing Deep Learning architectures according to the radiological characteristics of each pathological finding. We estimated the tool's performance on the local population, obtaining results comparable to state-of-the-art metrics. We believe this approach is closer to the actual reading process of chest x-rays by professionals, and therefore more likely to be successful in a real clinical setting.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

One solution is medication review, a structured assessment of patients' drug orders by the pharmacist for optimizing the therapy. However, this task is tedious, cognitively complex and error-prone, and only a few clinical decision support systems have been proposed for supporting it. Existing systems are either rule-based systems implementing guidelines, or documentary systems presenting drug knowledge. In this paper, we present the ABiMed research project, and, through literature reviews and brainstorming, we identified five candidate innovations for a decision support system for medication review: patient data transfer from GP to pharmacists, use of semantic technologies, association of rule-based and documentary approaches, use of machine learning, and a two-way discussion between pharmacist and GP after the medication review.},

For this reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical decision support. However, publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting of traditional approaches. Method(s): To address this problem, we propose an innovative automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to handle small datasets by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses on on-the-fly generation of unique and random image patches for training by performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting extensive data augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a standard 3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural network architectures. Result(s): Through a k-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans as training and validation of COVID-19, we were able to develop a highly accurate as well as robust segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting on limited data. We performed an in-detail analysis and discussion on the robustness of our pipeline through a sensitivity analysis based on the cross-validation and impact on model generalizability of applied preprocessing techniques. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients for COVID-19 infection between predicted and annotated segmentation from radiologists of 0.804 on validation and 0.661 on a separate testing set consisting of 100 patients. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms related approaches, advances the state-of-the-art for COVID-19 segmentation and improves robust medical image analysis based on limited data.Copyright © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract = {The development of increasingly sophisticated methods to acquire high-resolution images has led to the generation of large collections of biomedical imaging data, including images of tissues and organs. Many of the current machine learning methods that aim to extract biological knowledge from histopathological images require several data preprocessing stages, creating an overhead before the proper analysis. Here we present PyHIST (https://github. com/manuel-munoz-aguirre/PyHIST),), an easy-to-use, open source whole slide histological image tissue segmentation and preprocessing command-line tool aimed at tile generation for machine learning applications. From a given input image, the PyHIST pipeline i) optionally rescales the image to a different resolution, ii) produces a mask for the input image which separates the background from the tissue, and iii) generates individual image tiles with tissue content. Author summary Histopathology images are an essential tool to assess and quantify tissue composition and its relationship to disease. The digitization of slides and the decreasing costs of computation and data storage have fueled the development of new computational methods, especially in the field of machine learning. These methods seek to make use of the histopathological patterns encoded in these slides with the aim of aiding clinicians in healthcare decision-making, as well as researchers in tissue biology. However, in order to prepare digital slides for usage in machine learning applications, researchers usually need to develop custom scripts from scratch in order to reshape the image data in a way that is suitable to train a model, slowing down the development process. With PyHIST, we provide a toolbox for researchers that work in the intersection of machine learning, biology and histology to effortlessly preprocess whole slide images into image tiles in a standardized manner for usage in external applications.},

  abstract = {Objective: Metformin is the preferred first-line medication for management of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. However, over a third of patients experience primary or secondary therapeutic failure. We developed machine learning models to predict which patients initially prescribed metformin will achieve and maintain control of their blood glucose after one year of therapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative claims data for 12,147 commercially-insured adults and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with prediabetes or diabetes. Several machine learning models were trained using variables available at the time of metformin initiation to predict achievement and maintenance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) {$<$} 7.0\% after one year of therapy. Result(s): AUC performances based on five-fold cross-validation ranged from 0.58 to 0.75. The most influential variables driving the predictions were baseline HbA1c, starting metformin dosage, and presence of diabetes with complications. Conclusion(s): Machine learning models can effectively predict primary or secondary metformin treatment failure within one year. This information can help identify effective individualized treatment strategies. Most of the implemented models outperformed traditional logistic regression, highlighting the potential for applying machine learning to problems in medicine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Intelligent Tutoring Systems authoring tools are highly complex educational software applications used to produce highly complex software applications (i.e. ITSs). How should our assumptions about the target users (authors) impact the design of authoring tools? In this article I first reflect on the factors leading to my original 1999 article on the state of the art in ITS authoring tools and consider some challenges facing authoring tool researchers today. Then, in the bulk of the paper, I propose some principled foundations for future authoring tool design, focusing on operationalizing the construct of complexity-for tool, task, and user. ITS authoring tools are major undertakings and to redeem this investment it is important to anticipate actual user needs and capacities. I propose that one way to do this is to match the complexity of tool design to the complexity of authoring tasks and the complexity capacity of users and user communities. Doing so entails estimating the complexity of the mental models that a user is expected to build in order to use a tool as intended. The goal is not so much to support the design of more powerful authoring tools as it is to design tools that meet the needs of realistic user audiences. This paper presents some exploratory ideas on how to operationalize the concept of complexity for tool, task, and user. The paper draws from the following theories and frameworks to weave this narrative: Complexity Science, Activity Theory, Epistemic Forms and Games, and adult cognitive developmental theory (Hierarchical Complexity Theory). This exploration of usability and complexity is applicable to the design of any type of complex authoring application, though the application area that motivated the exploration is ITS authoring.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps play an important role in delivering education, providing advice on treatment, and monitoring patients' health. Good usability of mHealth apps is essential to achieve the objectives of mHealth apps efficiently. To date, there are questionnaires available to assess the general system usability but not explicitly tailored to precisely assess the usability of mHealth apps. Hence, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was developed with 4 versions according to the type of app (interactive or standalone) and according to the target user (patient or provider). Standalone MAUQ for patients comprises 3 subscales, which are ease of use, interface and satisfaction, and usefulness. Objective: This study aimed to translate and validate the English version of MAUQ (standalone for patients) into a Malay version of MAUQ (M-MAUQ) for mHealth app research and usage in future in Malaysia. Methods: Forward and backward translation and harmonization of M-MAUQ were conducted by Malay native speakers who also spoke English as their second language. The process began with a forward translation by 2 independent translators followed by harmonization to produce an initial translated version of M-MAUQ. Next, the forward translation was continued by another 2 translators who had never seen the original MAUQ. Lastly, harmonization was conducted among the committee members to resolve any ambiguity and inconsistency in the words and sentences of the items derived with the prefinal adapted questionnaire. Subsequently, content and face validations were performed with 10 experts and 10 target users, respectively. Modified kappa statistic was used to determine the interrater agreement among the raters. The reliability of the M-MAUQ was assessed by 51 healthy young adult mobile phone users. Participants needed to install the MyFitnessPal app and use it for 2 days for familiarization before completing the designated task and answer the M-MAUQ. The MyFitnessPal app was selected because it is one among the most popular installed mHealth apps globally available for iPhone and Android users and represents a standalone mHealth app. Results: The content validity index for the relevancy and clarity of M-MAUQ were determined to be 0.983 and 0.944, respectively, which indicated good relevancy and clarity. The face validity index for understandability was 0.961, which indicated that users understood the M-MAUQ. The kappa statistic for every item in M-MAUQ indicated excellent agreement between the raters (kappa ranging from 0.76 to 1.09). The Cronbach alpha for 18 items was .946, which also indicated good reliability in assessing the usability of the mHealth app. Conclusions: The M-MAUQ fulfilled the validation criteria as it revealed good reliability and validity similar to the original version. M-MAUQ can be used to assess the usability of mHealth apps in Malay in the future.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: An intelligent information technology based system could have a positive impact on the life-style of patients suffering from chronic diseases by providing useful health recommendations. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid model that provides disease prediction and medical recommendations to cardiac patients. The first part aims at implementing a prediction model, that can identify the disease of a patient and classify it into one of the four output classes i.e., non-cardiac chest pain, silent ischemia, angina, and myocardial infarction. Following the disease prediction, the second part of the model provides general medical recommendations to patients., METHODS: The recommendations are generated by assessing the severity of clinical features of patients, estimating the risk associated with clinical features and disease, and calculating the probability of occurrence of disease. The purpose of this model is to build an intelligent and adaptive recommender system for heart disease patients. The experiments for the proposed recommender system are conducted on a clinical data set collected and labelled in consultation with medical experts from a known hospital., RESULTS: The performance of the proposed prediction model is evaluated using accuracy and kappa statistics as evaluation measures. The medical recommendations are generated based on information collected from a knowledge base created with the help of physicians. The results of the recommendation model are evaluated using confusion matrix and gives an accuracy of 97.8\%., CONCLUSION: The proposed system exhibits good prediction and recommendation accuracies and promises to be a useful contribution in the field of e-health and medical informatics.

  abstract = {Today's telecommunication networks have become sources of enormous amounts of widely heterogeneous data. This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users' behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical toots, machine learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing, and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey relevant literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial on ML for researchers and practitioners interested in this field. Although a good number of research papers have recently appeared, the application of ML to optical networks is still in its infancy: to stimulate further work in this area, we conclude this paper proposing new possible research directions.},

We argue that a subset of colour categories, if fundamental, will be coherent - meaning that a non-trivial criterion distinguishes them from the other colour categories. We test the coherence of subsets of achromatic (white, black and grey), primary (white, black, red, green, yellow, blue) and basic (primaries plus brown, orange, purple, pink and grey) colour categories in English. Criteria for defining colour categories were expressed in terms of behavioural, linguistic and geometric features derived from colour naming and linguistic usage data; and were discovered using machine learning methods. We find that achromatic and basic colour categories are coherent subsets but not primaries. These results support claims that the basic colour categories have special status, and undermine claims about the fundamental role of primaries in colour naming systems.},

Secondly, the paper presents some observations and lessons learned from an application of the framework by an experienced practitioner not involved in the original development of the framework. The findings were then used to develop a set of guidelines for enhancing the understandability and effective usage of the framework.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) applications generate a diversity of novelty applications and services in next-generation networks (NGN), which is essential to guarantee end-to-end (E2E) communication resources for both control plane (CP) and data plane (DP). Likewise, the heterogeneous 5th generation (5G) communication applications, including Mobile Broadband Communications (MBBC), massive Machine-Type Commutation (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC), obligate to perform intelligent Quality-of-Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), while the CP entities will be suffered from the complicated massive HIOT applications. Moreover, the existing management and orchestration (MANO) models are inappropriate for resource utilization and allocation in large-scale and complicated network environments. To cope with the issues mentioned above, this paper presents an adopted software-defined mobile edge computing (SDMEC) with a lightweight machine learning (ML) algorithm, namely support vector machine (SVM), to enable intelligent MANO for real-time and resource-constraints IoT applications which require lightweight computation models. Furthermore, the SVM algorithm plays an essential role in performing QCI classification. Moreover, the software-defined networking (SDN) controller allocates and configures priority resources according to the SVM classification outcomes. Thus, the complementary of SVM and SDMEC conducts intelligent resource MANO for massive QCI environments and meets the perspectives of mission-critical communication with resource constraint applications. Based on the E2E experimentation metrics, the proposed scheme shows remarkable outperformance in key performance indicator (KPI) QoS, including communication reliability, latency, and communication throughput over the various powerful reference methods.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that pulmonary vascular diseases may specifically affect arteries or veins through different physiologic mechanisms. To detect changes in the two vascular trees, physicians manually analyze the chest computed tomography (CT) image of the patients in search of abnormalities. This process is time consuming, difficult to standardize, and thus not feasible for large clinical studies or useful in real-world clinical decision making. Therefore, automatic separation of arteries and veins in CT images is becoming of great interest, as it may help physicians to accurately diagnose pathological conditions. In this paper, we present a novel, fully automatic approach to classify vessels from chest CT images into arteries and veins. The algorithm follows three main steps: first, a scale-space particles segmentation to isolate vessels; then a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain a first classification of vessels; finally, graph-cuts' optimization to refine the results. To justify the usage of the proposed CNN architecture, we compared different 2-D and 3-D CNNs that may use local information from bronchus-and vessel-enhanced images provided to the network with different strategies. We also compared the proposed CNN approach with a randomforests (RFs) classifier. The methodology was trained and evaluated on the superior and inferior lobes of the right lung of 18 clinical cases with noncontrast chest CT scans, in comparison with manual classification. The proposed algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 94\%, which is higher than the accuracy obtained using other CNN architectures and RF. Our method was also validated with contrast-enhanced CT scans of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension to demonstrate that our model generalizes well to contrast-enhanced modalities. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for future use of 3-D CNN for artery/vein classification in CT images.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the methodological quality of studies on prediction models developed using machine learning techniques across all medical specialties. Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes. Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall). Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38\%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62\%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 81\% to 91\%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56\%, 48\% to 64\%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41\%, 33\% to 49\%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39\%, 31\% to 47\%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73\%, 66\% to 79\%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74\%, 51\% to 88\%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40\%, 32\% to 47\%) and 79 (52\%, 44\% to 60\%) of the developed models, respectively. Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

  abstract = {Abundant data of the patients is recorded within the health care system. During data mining process, we can achieve useful knowledge and hidden patterns within the data and consequently we will discover the meaningful knowledge. The discovered knowledge can be used by physicians and managers of health care to improve the quality of their services and to reduce the number of their medical errors. Since by the usage of a single data mining algorithm, it is difficult to diagnose or predict diseases, therefore in this research, we take a combination of the advantages of some algorithms in order to achieve better results in terms of efficiency. Most of standard learning algorithms have been designed for balanced data (the data with the same frequency of samples in each class), where the cost of wrong classification is the same within all classes. These algorithms cannot properly represent data distribution characteristics when datasets are imbalanced. In some cases, the cost of wrong classification can be very high in a sample of a special class, such as wrongly misclassifying cancerous individuals or patients as healthy ones. In this article, it is tried to present a fast and efficient way to learn from imbalanced data. This method is more suitable for learning from the imbalanced data having very little data in class of minority. Experiments show that the proposed method has more efficiency compared to traditional simple algorithms of machine learning, as well as several special-to-imbalanced-data learning algorithms. In addition, this method has lower computational complexity and faster implementation time.Copyright © 2017},

In dermatology, researchers are evaluating the potential for direct-to-patient and clinician decision-support AI tools to classify skin lesions. Although AI is poised to change how patients engage in health care, patient perspectives remain poorly understood., Objective: To explore how patients conceptualize AI and perceive the use of AI for skin cancer screening., Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative study using a grounded theory approach to semistructured interview analysis was conducted in general dermatology clinics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and melanoma clinics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Forty-eight patients were enrolled. Each interview was independently coded by 2 researchers with interrater reliability measurement; reconciled codes were used to assess code frequency. The study was conducted from May 6 to July 8, 2019., Main Outcomes and Measures: Artificial intelligence concept, perceived benefits and risks of AI, strengths and weaknesses of AI, AI implementation, response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making, and recommendation for or against AI., Results: Of 48 patients enrolled, 26 participants (54\%) were women; mean (SD) age was 53.3 (21.7) years. Sixteen patients (33\%) had a history of melanoma, 16 patients (33\%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer only, and 16 patients (33\%) had no history of skin cancer. Twenty-four patients were interviewed about a direct-to-patient AI tool and 24 patients were interviewed about a clinician decision-support AI tool. Interrater reliability ratings for the 2 coding teams were kappa = 0.94 and kappa = 0.89. Patients primarily conceptualized AI in terms of cognition. Increased diagnostic speed (29 participants [60\%]) and health care access (29 [60\%]) were the most commonly perceived benefits of AI for skin cancer screening; increased patient anxiety was the most commonly perceived risk (19 [40\%]). Patients perceived both more accurate diagnosis (33 [69\%]) and less accurate diagnosis (41 [85\%]) to be the greatest strength and weakness of AI, respectively. The dominant theme that emerged was the importance of symbiosis between humans and AI (45 [94\%]). Seeking biopsy was the most common response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making (32 [67\%]). Overall, 36 patients (75\%) would recommend AI to family members and friends., Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study, patients appeared to be receptive to the use of AI for skin cancer screening if implemented in a manner that preserves the integrity of the human physician-patient relationship.},

  abstract = {Purpose. To provide pharmacists and other clinicians with a basic understanding of the underlying principles and practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medication-use process. Summary. "Artificial intelligence" is a general term used to describe the theory and development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally would require human cognition, such as perception, language understanding, reasoning, learning, planning, and problem solving. Following the fundamental theorem of informatics, a better term for AI would be "augmented intelligence," or leveraging the strengths of computers and the strengths of clinicians together to obtain improved outcomes for patients. Understanding the vocabulary of and methods used in AI will help clinicians productively communicate with data scientists to collaborate on developing models that augment patient care. This primer includes discussion of approaches to identifying problems in practice that could benefit from application of AI and those that would not, as well as methods of training, validating, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining AI models. Some key limitations of AI related to the medication-use process are also discussed. Conclusion. As medication-use domain experts, pharmacists play a key role in developing and evaluating AI in healthcare. An understanding of the core concepts of AI is necessary to engage in collaboration with data scientists and critically evaluating its place in patient care, especially as clinical practice continues to evolve and develop.Copyright © American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2020.

  abstract = {Across the landscape of mental health research and diagnosis, there is a diverse range of questionnaires and interviews available for use by clinicians and researchers to determine patient treatment plans or investigate internal and external etiologies. Although individually, these tools have each been assessed for their validity and reliability, there is little research examining the consistency between them in terms of what symptoms they assess, and how they assess those symptoms. Here, we provide an analysis of 126 different questionnaires and interviews commonly used to diagnose and screen for 10 different disorder types including depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), addiction, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as comparator questionnaires and interviews that offer an all-in-one cross-disorder assessment of mental health. We demonstrate substantial inconsistency in the inclusion and emphasis of symptoms assessed within disorders as well as considerable symptom overlap across disorder-specific tools. Within the same disorder, similarity scores across assessment tools ranged from 29\% for assessment of bipolar disorder to a maximum of 58\% for OCD. Furthermore, when looking across disorders, 60\% of symptoms were assessed in at least half of all disorders illustrating the extensive overlap in symptom profiles between disorder-specific assessment tools. Biases in assessment toward emotional, cognitive, physical or behavioral symptoms were also observed, further adding to the heterogeneity across assessments. Analysis of other characteristics such as the time period over which symptoms were assessed, as well as whether there was a focus toward frequency, severity or duration of symptoms also varied substantially across assessment tools. The consequence of this inconsistent and heterogeneous assessment landscape is that it hinders clinical diagnosis and treatment and frustrates understanding of the social, environmental, and biological factors that contribute to mental health symptoms and disorders. Altogether, it underscores the need for standardized assessment tools that are more disorder agnostic and span the full spectrum of mental health symptoms to aid the understanding of underlying etiologies and the discovery of new treatments for psychiatric dysfunction.},

However, to effectively use machine learning tools in health care, several limitations must be addressed and key issues considered, such as its clinical implementation and ethics in health-care delivery. Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem. Also crucial are ethical considerations, which include medico-legal implications, doctors' understanding of machine learning tools, and data privacy and security. In this Review, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of big data and machine learning in health care.},

This work is a continuation of our earlier works where we now examine feature extraction methodology on Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) tests and machine learning classifiers to differentiate patients with balance problems versus normal subjects on an expanded cohort of 60 patients. All data was obtained using our custom designed low-cost wireless gait analysis sensor (WGAS) containing a basic inertial measurement unit (IMU) worn by each subject during the DGI tests. The raw gait data is wirelessly transmitted from the WGAS for real-time gait data collection and analysis. Here we demonstrate predictive classifiers that achieve high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing abnormal from normal gaits. These results show that gait data collected from our very low-cost wearable wireless gait sensor can effectively differentiate patients with balance disorders from normal subjects in real-time using various classifiers.

  abstract = {Objective. While prosthetic hands with independently actuated digits have become commercially available, state-of-the-art human-machine interfaces (HMI) only permit control over a limited set of grasp patterns, which does not enable amputees to experience sufficient improvement in their daily activities to make an active prosthesis useful. Approach. Here we present a technology platform combining fully-integrated bioelectronics, implantable intrafascicular microelectrodes and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate this missing bridge by tapping into the intricate motor control signals of peripheral nerves. The bioelectric neural interface includes an ultra-low-noise neural recording system to sense electroneurography (ENG) signals from microelectrode arrays implanted in the residual nerves, and AI models employing the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to decode the subject's motor intention. Main results. A pilot human study has been carried out on a transradial amputee. We demonstrate that the information channel established by the proposed neural interface is sufficient to provide high accuracy control of a prosthetic hand up to 15 degrees of freedom (DOF). The interface is intuitive as it directly maps complex prosthesis movements to the patient's true intention. Significance. Our study layouts the foundation towards not only a robust and dexterous control strategy for modern neuroprostheses at a near-natural level approaching that of the able hand, but also an intuitive conduit for connecting human minds and machines through the peripheral neural pathways.

  abstract = {Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) was used to classify rabbits that were induced to have liver disease by placing them on a fatty diet for a defined duration and/or periodically injecting them with CCl4. The ground truth of the liver state was based on lipid liver percents estimated via the Folch assay and hydroxyproline concentration to quantify fibrosis. Rabbits were scanned ultrasonically in vivo using a SonixOne scanner and an L9-4/38 linear array. Liver fat percentage was classified based on the ultrasonic backscattered radiofrequency (RF) signals from the livers using either QUS or a 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN). Use of QUS parameters with linear regression and canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that the QUS parameters could differentiate between livers with lipid levels above or below 5\%. However, the QUS parameters were not sensitive to fibrosis. The CNN was implemented by analyzing raw RF ultrasound signals without using separate reference data. The CNN outputs the classification of liver as either above or below a threshold of 5\% fat level in the liver. The CNN outperformed the classification utilizing the QUS parameters combined with a support vector machine in differentiating between low and high lipid liver levels (i.e., accuracies of 74\% versus 59\% on the testing data). Therefore, although the CNN did not provide a physical interpretation of the tissue properties (e.g., attenuation of the medium or scatterer properties) the CNN had much higher accuracy in predicting fatty liver state and did not require an external reference scan.

In spite of the availability of authentic research studies of smart wearables, there is still a lack of systematic review on the different aspects of smart wearables concept to find the current state of research, particularly from the perspective of IS field. Therefore, the predominant aim of this research is to review smart wearables literature, recent advances, and future challenges. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was conducted to explore smart wearables by reviewing previous studies from 2010 to 2019. For covering all related papers during these years, an integrated review protocol consisting of automatic and manual stages was pursued. 244 papers were identified to address smart wearables issues and challenges. According to the findings, it is observed that smart wearable studies have increased dramatically during the last years. Moreover, the results show that current studies covered different research themes which are related to smart wearables area, particularly user behavior, technology-focused, security and privacy, design, and social acceptability. Furthermore, based on the results of the weight analysis technique, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, social influence, and privacy concerns are identified as the best predictors of smart wearables adoption. Additionally, the results show that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the most commonly adopted theory in the smart wearable studies. The findings of this review would assist academics to realize the existing limitations and gaps as well as the future works for smart wearables research studies.},

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI-DSS in real world diabetes clinics. Method(s): Data was collected and evaluated from routine AI-DSS usage for individuals with type 1 diabetes treated at 21 diabetes clinics (in the USA and 2 in Israel) . Two analyses were made: (1) Insulin dose recommendations were compared for rate of agreement/disagreement between those suggested by the AI-DSS and the approved recommendations by health care providers (HCP) . (2) Glycemic outcomes were compared between baseline and after 3 months of AI-DSS use. Included in this analysis were individuals who had mean baseline glucose level {$>$}= 182 mg/dL and at least one AI-DSS recommendation within the 3-months. Result(s): A total of 8 recommendations, provided to 370 individuals, were evaluated. Full agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments was observed in 87\%, 87\%, and 83\% of the basal rate, carbs ratio (CR) , and correction factor (CF) pump settings parameters, respectively. Full disagreement on the direction of dose change was observed in only 0.9\%, 0.5\%, and 1.2\% for the basal rate, CR and CF, respectively. Glycemic outcome analysis included 1 eligible individuals (mean of 1.6 recommendations within a 3-month interval) . Average sensor percentage of time in range [70-180 mg/dL] increased by 4\% (p=0.003) : 43\% increased time in range by more than 5\% and 33\% increased by 10\% or more. Time in hyperglycemia [{$>$} 180 mg/dL] was reduced by 5\% (p{$<$}0.01) while time in severe hypoglycemia [{$<$} 54 mg/dL] remained below 0.5\%. Conclusion(s): A high rate of agreement with automated insulin adjustments was observed among HCPs at academic centers who used the AI-DSS in their workflow. Glycemic control was significantly improved for sub-optimally controlled individuals already after 3-months of follow up.},

Here, a deep learning model for real-time polyp detection based on a pre-trained YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) architecture and complemented with a post-processing step based on an object-tracking algorithm to reduce false positives is reported. The base YOLOv3 network was fine-tuned using a dataset composed of 28,576 images labelled with locations of 941 polyps that will be made public soon. In a frame-based evaluation using isolated images containing polyps, a general F-1 score of 0.88 was achieved (recall = 0.87, precision = 0.89), with lower predictive performance in flat polyps, but higher for sessile, and pedunculated morphologies, as well as with the usage of narrow band imaging, whereas polyp size {$<$} 5 mm does not seem to have significant impact. In a polyp-based evaluation using polyp and normal mucosa videos, with a positive criterion defined as the presence of at least one 50-frames-length (window size) segment with a ratio of 75\% of frames with predicted bounding boxes (frames positivity), 72.61\% of sensitivity (95\% CI 68.99-75.95) and 83.04\% of specificity (95\% CI 76.70-87.92) were achieved (Youden = 0.55, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) = 12.98). When the positive criterion is less stringent (window size = 25, frames positivity = 50\%), sensitivity reaches around 90\% (sensitivity = 89.91\%, 95\% CI 87.20-91.94; specificity = 54.97\%, 95\% CI 47.49-62.24; Youden = 0.45; DOR = 10.76). The object-tracking algorithm has demonstrated a significant improvement in specificity whereas maintaining sensitivity, as well as a marginal impact on computational performance.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The advent of clinically adapted machine learning algorithms can solve numerous problems ranging from disease diagnosis and prognosis to therapy recommendations. This systematic review examines the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluates the progress made to date towards their implementation in clinical practice., METHODS: Systematic searching of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and WHO Covid-19 database) to identify original articles published between January 2011 and October 2021. Studies reporting ML techniques in clinical practice involving humans and ML algorithms with a performance metric were considered., RESULTS: Of 873 unique articles identified, 36 studies were eligible for inclusion. The XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm showed the highest potential for clinical applications (n = 7 studies); this was followed jointly by random forest algorithm, logistic regression, and the support vector machine, respectively (n = 5 studies). Prediction of outcomes (n = 33), in particular Inflammatory diseases (n = 7) received the most attention followed by cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 5 for each) and Covid-19 (n = 4). Thirty-three out of the thirty-six included studies passed more than 50\% of the selected quality assessment criteria in the TRIPOD checklist. In contrast, none of the studies could achieve an ideal overall bias rating of 'low' based on the PROBAST checklist. In contrast, only three studies showed evidence of the deployment of ML algorithm(s) in clinical practice., CONCLUSIONS: ML is potentially a reliable tool for clinical decision support. Although advocated widely in clinical practice, work is still in progress to validate clinically adapted ML algorithms. Improving quality standards, transparency, and interpretability of ML models will further lower the barriers to acceptability. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recently released public datasets have been of great interest to the field, but pose specific challenges due to the disconnect they cause between data generation and data usage, potentially limiting the utility of these datasets. Materials and Methods: We visually explore two large public datasets, to determine how accurate the provided labels are and whether other subtle problems exist. The ChestXray14 dataset contains 112,120 frontal chest films, and the Musculoskeletal Radiology (MURA) dataset contains 40,561 upper limb radiographs. A subset of around 700 images from both datasets was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist, and the quality of the original labels was determined. Results: The ChestXray14 labels did not accurately reflect the visual content of the images, with positive predictive values mostly between 10\% and 30\% lower than the values presented in the original documentation. There were other significant problems, with examples of hidden stratification and label disambiguation failure. The MURA labels were more accurate, but the original normal/abnormal labels were inaccurate for the subset of cases with degenerative joint disease, with a sensitivity of 60\% and a specificity of 82\%. Conclusion: Visual inspection of images is a necessary component of understanding large image datasets. We recommend that teams producing public datasets should perform this important quality control procedure and include a thorough description of their findings, along with an explanation of the data generating procedures and labeling rules, in the documentation for their datasets.},

In the first use-case, the personal nudging system, patients receive text messages when an alert of a missed medication or routine health check is detected by AI2. In the second use-case, as a clinical decision support tool, AI2 generated alerts are presented as flags through a dashboard to the community mental health professionals. Implementation protocols for different scenarios of AI2, along with a mixed-methods evaluation, are planned to identify pragmatic issues necessary to inform a larger randomised control trial, as well as improve the application., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by The Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee.

Therefore, this paper is aimed at investigating why social media users share fake news about environmentally friendly brands. To examine social media users' behavior towards environmentally friendly brands, a theoretical research model proposed and analyzed using structural equations modeling in SmartPLS on a convenience sample consisting of 922 questionnaires. Data was collected by means of a quantitative-based approach via a survey conducted among social media users from an emerging market. The results show that social media flow has a mediated impact on sharing fake news about environmentally friendly brands on social media. Considering the critical consequences of fake news, the paper argues that understanding the dissemination process of this type of bogus content on social media platforms has important theoretical and managerial implications. Understanding the psychological mechanisms that influence people's behavior in sharing fake news about environmentally friendly brands on social networking sites (SNS) could help in better understanding the factors and the effects of this phenomenon. The originality of this research consists of proposing flow theory from positive psychology to be used as a theoretical framework to explain users' behavior of sharing fake news about environmentally friendly brands on social media.},

However, little is known about how PA can influence farmers' sense of self, their skills and competencies, and the meanings that farmers ascribe to farming. This study is animated by scholarly commitment to social identity research, and draws from socio-cyber-physical systems research, domestication theory, and activity theory. This conceptualization of PA within these theoretical perspectives helps to render visible how big agricultural data and machine learning algorithms can affect meaning, doing, and being for US farmers. Through analysis of data from six focus group discussions and follow-up surveys with stakeholders across the PA value chain, this paper shows that PA tools can necessitate farmers to learn and develop new competencies such as flying drones and interpreting yield maps. At the same time, PA can shape new meaning of farm work and new expectation about a 'good farmer', changing what it means to be a 'successful' farmer from someone who is not only a data observer or data gatherer but also validators of PA models by using their local knowledge of agronomic and environmental phenomenon. We conclude that PA can alter social expectations about farming by reorienting the role of farmers. Policymakers and agriculture extension and outreach programmers can develop more socially relevant PA knowledge and innovation if they can attend to both new and traditional 'good farmer' identities.},

  abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to identify a transcriptomic signature that could be used to classify subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to controls on the basis of blood gene expression profiles. The gene expression profiles could ultimately be used as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. Methods We used the published microarray data (GSE26415) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 21 young adults with ASD and 21 age- and sex-matched unaffected controls. Nineteen differentially expressed probes were identified from a training dataset (n=26, 13 ASD cases and 13 controls) using the limma package in R language (adjusted p value {$<$}0.05) and were further analyzed in a test dataset (n=16, 8 ASD cases and 8 controls) using machine learning algorithms. Results Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that subjects with ASD were relatively well-discriminated from controls. Based on the support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors analysis, validation of 19-DE probes with a test dataset resulted in an overall class prediction accuracy of 93.8\% as well as a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 87.5\%, respectively. Conclusion The results of our exploratory study suggest that the gene expression profiles identified from the peripheral blood samples of young adults with ASD can be used to identify a biological signature for ASD. Further study using a larger cohort and more homogeneous datasets is required to improve the diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {The aging world population requires a sustainable and high-quality healthcare system. To examine the efficiency of medical cooperation, medical provider and physician networks were constructed using patient claims data. Previous studies have shown that these networks contain information on medical cooperation. However, the usage patterns of multiple medical providers in a series of medical services have not been considered. In addition, these studies used only general network features to represent medical cooperation, but their expressive ability was low. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the medical provider network to examine its overall contribution to the quality of healthcare provided by cooperation between medical providers in a series of medical services. This study focused on: i) the method of feature extraction from the network, ii) incorporation of the usage pattern of medical providers, and iii) expressive ability of the statistical model. Femoral neck fractures were selected as the target disease. To build the medical provider networks, we analyzed the patient claims data from a single prefecture in Japan between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We considered four types of models. Models 1 and 2 use node strength and linear regression, with Model 2 also incorporating patient age as an input. Models 3 and 4 use feature representation by node2vec with linear regression and regression tree ensemble, a machine learning method. The results showed that medical providers with higher levels of cooperation reduce the duration of hospital stay. The overall contribution of the medical cooperation to the duration of hospital stay extracted from the medical provider network using node2vec is approximately 20\%, which is approximately 20 times higher than the model using strength.},

In the field for gastroenterology it is unknown, to which degree these tools are accepted and applied in clinical routine. We therefore conducted a mail survey in order to find out whether clinical gastroenterologists know, use or want formal decision-aids. To all clinical members of a german gastroenterological scientific society (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Verdauungs- und Stoffwechselkrankheiten, n = 584) an information leaflet and a questionnaire was sent. The form contained questions about use, knowledge and requests with respect to decision-aids in gastroenterology and concerning the attitude to computerized decision-aids in general. 584 clinicians received the questionnaire, 215 sent it back for analysis (39\%). Formal decision-aids were used by half of the survey participants (56\%), mainly three scores (Child-Pugh, Best and other indices for inflammatory bowel disease, Ranson) and four classifications (TNM, Forrest, Savary-Miller, Paquet). Computer-based formal decision-aids (e.g. expert systems) were used by a minority. Clinicians, who applied formal decision-aids stated more frequently a request for further decision-aids (72\%) than those who did not (46\%). A considerable part of the survey participants believed that computerized decision-aids will come into clinical routine (52\%) and will improve education (37\%) and clinical practice (35\%). 88\% were convinced, that decision-aids should be tested in controlled clinical trials before a clinical use can be recommended. There is a discrepancy between propagation of formal decision-aids and it's clinical use. Only a few scores and classifications are used in clinical routine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This has limited the usage of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in clinical routine and hindered its potential by depriving clinicians from assessing useful information that are needed in disease monitoring, treatment, progression, and decision making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fast and robust OCT image enhancement framework using non-linear statistical parametric technique. In the proposed framework, we utilize prior statistical information to model the image to follow Gaussian distribution. After which, a newly designed dual-parametric sigmoid function (DPSF) is utilized to control the dynamic range and contrast level of the image. To balance the intensity range and contrast level, both linear and non-linear normalization operations are performed, then followed by a mapping operation to obtain the enhanced image. Experimentation results on the three OCT vendors show that the proposed method obtained high values in EME, PSNR, SSIM, rho, and low value in MSE of 36.72, 38.87, 0.87, 0.98, and 25.12 for Cirrus; 40.77, 41.84, 0.89, 0.98, and 22.15 for Spectralis; and 30.81, 32.10, 0.81, 0.96, and 28.55 for Topcon OCT devices, respectively. The proposed DPSF framework performs better than the state-of-the-art methods and improves the interpretability and perception of the OCT images, which can provide clinicians and computer vision program with good quantitative and qualitative information.},

This systematic survey explores various scenarios employing deep learning in financial markets, especially the stock market. A key requirement for our methodology is its focus on research papers involving backtesting. That is, we consider whether the experimentation mode is sufficient for market practitioners to consider the work in a real-world use case. Works meeting this requirement are distributed across seven distinct specializations. Most studies focus on trade strategy, price prediction, and portfolio management, with a limited number considering market simulation, stock selection, hedging strategy, and risk management. We also recognize that domain-specific metrics such as "returns" and "volatility" appear most important for accurately representing model performance across specializations. Our study demonstrates that, although there have been some improvements in reproducibility, substantial work remains to be done regarding model explainability. Accordingly, we suggest several future directions, such as improving trust by creating reproducible, explainable, and accountable models and emphasizing prediction of longer-term horizons-potentially via the utilization of supplementary data-which continues to represent a significant unresolved challenge.},

Both the content and the structure are essential for successful implementation of structured reporting. Contextual structured reporting is tailored to a specific scenario and can contain information retrieved from the context. Critical findings detected by imaging need urgent communication to the referring physician. According to guidelines, the occurrence of this communication should be documented in the radiology reports and should contain when, to whom and how was communicated. In free-text reporting, one or more of these required items might be omitted. We developed a contextual structured reporting template to ensure complete documentation of the communication of critical findings. The WHEN and HOW items were included automatically, and the insertion of the WHO-item was facilitated by the template. A pre- and post-implementation study demonstrated a substantial improvement in guideline adherence. The template usage improved in the long-term post-implementation study compared with the short-term results. The two most often occurring categories of critical findings are "infection / inflammation" and "oncology", corresponding to the a large part of urgency level 2 (to be reported within 6 h) and level 3 (to be reported within 6 days), respectively. We conclude that contextual structured reporting is feasible for required elements in radiology reporting and for automated insertion of context-dependent data. Contextual structured reporting improves guideline adherence for communication of critical findings.},

  abstract = {Health status checkup is a crucial step towards early detection of diseases. Health status diagnosis, in university health centers, within the sub-Saharan African region, can be cumbersome and time consuming. In many cases, facilities for health checkup are not available. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a promising approach, when integrated with in-silico methods. This study was conducted to implement a TCM-based computational health informatics diagnostic tool. The tool was applied to diagnose African students. This study was also conducted to stimulate further research into in-silico TCM diagnostics. Besides developing a reliable biometric verification system, to ascertain the real identities of patients brought to university health centers, it is assistive to create a platform that provides automated and complementary support for preliminary health diagnostic activities. It also mitigates stress, by helping to efficiently decipher and provide quick objective opinion from the perspective of a computerized decision support system. The diagnostic module of the computational health informatics diagnostic tool adopts knowledge from a TCM facial color diagnosis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for relevant full-text research papers. Only research publications written in English language were reviewed. The present work was compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the existing works noted in the literature. Facial detection and matching algorithms were implemented for the TCM-based computational health informatics diagnostic tool by using Java programming language. Facial image acquisition processes were conducted. Captured facial images of African students were preprocessed. Facial feature extraction was performed by implementing feature extraction algorithms. An algorithm for the extraction of color information and measurement was also implemented. Knowledge of machine learning was applied to extract and collate facial features, and to machine learn from them. Facial classification and recognition algorithms were implemented. Finally, the results from the computational health informatics diagnostic tool were evaluated, by conducting a performance evaluation and validation. This study provides qualitative and quantitative information on facial recognition, facial color information measurement, as well as prediction of health status, for some sub-Saharan African University students. Performance evaluation was shown using confusion matrix and ROC curves. Statistical analysis of the experimental results was presented. The parameters in each diagnostic illustration were shown with valid range. In order to justify the effectiveness of the computational tool, further explanations were provided from relevant methodology guides on the evaluation of diagnostic tests. The computational health informatics diagnostic tool will complement the diagnostic efforts in university health centers of sub-Saharan African universities. It will also be useful for personal health diagnosis of interested individuals. The tool will also be viable for educating health professionals. TCM will be of immense benefit to developing countries by positively contributing towards diagnosing different non-communicable diseases and some infectious diseases in such countries.Copyright © 2018},

MorChana is a mobile application utilized in Thailand to help mitigate the spread of the virus. This study aimed to explore factors affecting the actual use (AU) of the application through the use of machine learning algorithms (MLA) such as Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An integrated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) were considered. Using convenience sampling, a total of 907 valid responses from those who answered the online survey were voluntarily gathered. With 93.00\% and 98.12\% accuracy from RFC and ANN, it was seen that hedonic motivation and facilitating conditions were seen to be factors affecting very high AU; while habit and understanding led to high AU. It was seen that when people understand the impact and causes of the COVID-19 pandemic's aftermath, its severity, and also see a way to reduce it, it would lead to the actual usage of a system. The findings of this study could be used by developers, the government, and stakeholders to capitalize on using the health-related applications with the intention of increasing actual usage. The framework and methodology used presented a way to evaluate health-related technologies. Moreover, the developing trends of using MLA for evaluating human behavior-related studies were further justified in this study. It is suggested that MLA could be utilized to assess factors affecting human behavior and technology used worldwide.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that requires a long and complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia diagnosis from brain imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust. Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and 'self attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached, improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98\% accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation.},

The quality of the articles identified was assessed with a modified Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for cross-sessional research., RESULTS: A total of 26 articles were identified for the study that has IDS for TV (n = 2, 7.8 \%), asynchrony (n = 9, 34.6 \%), weaning (n = 12, 46.2 \%), and others (n = 3, 11.5 \%). It was affirmed that implementing IDS in MV management will enhance seamless ICU patient management following the utilization of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in decision support. The studies relied on (n = 14) ML algorithms to predict the TV, asynchrony, weaning, risk of PMV and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) changes of 11-20262 ICU patients records with model inputs ranging from (n = 1) for timeseries analysis of TV to (n = 47) for weaning prediction., CONCLUSIONS: The small data size, poor study design, and result reporting, with the heterogeneity of techniques used in the various studies, hampered the development of a unified approach for managing MV efficiency in TV monitoring, asynchrony, and weaning predictions. Notwithstanding, the ensemble model was able to predict TV, asynchrony, and weaning to a higher accuracy than the other algorithms. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

MAIA (Multifunctional, adaptive, and interactive AI system for Acting in multiple contexts) is a human-centered AI aiming to allow end-users to control assistive devices naturally and efficiently by using continuous bidirectional exchanges among multiple sensorimotor information. MethodsAimed at exploring the acceptability of MAIA, semi-structured interviews (both individual interviews and focus groups) are used to prompt possible end-users (both patients and caregivers) to express their opinions about expected functionalities, outfits, and the services that MAIA should embed, once developed, to fit end-users needs. DiscussionEnd-user indications are expected to interest MAIA technical, health-related, and setting components. Moreover, psycho-social issues are expected to align with the technology acceptance model. In particular, they are likely to involve intrinsic motivational and extrinsic social aspects, aspects concerning the usefulness of the MAIA system, and the related ease to use. At last, we expect individual factors to impact MAIA: gender, fragility levels, psychological aspects involved in the mental representation of body image, personal endurance, and tolerance toward AT-related burden might be the aspects end-users rise in evaluating the MAIA project.},

  abstract = {Background: Medical care commonly involves the apprehension of complex patterns of patient derangements to which the practitioner responds with patterns of interventions, as opposed to single therapeutic maneuvers. This complexity renders the objective assessment of practice patterns using conventional statistical approaches difficult. Methods: Combinatorial approaches drawn from symbolic dynamics are used to encode the observed patterns of patient derangement and associated practitioner response patterns as sequences of symbols. Concatenating each patient derangement symbol with the contemporaneous practitioner response symbol creates "words" encoding the simultaneous patient derangement and provider response patterns and yields an observed vocabulary with quantifiable statistical characteristics. Results: A fundamental observation in many natural languages is the existence of a power law relationship between the rank order of word usage and the absolute frequency with which particular words are uttered. We show that population level patterns of patient derangement: practitioner intervention word usage in two entirely unrelated domains of medical care display power law relationships similar to those of natural languages, and that-in one of these domains-power law behavior at the population level reflects power law behavior at the level of individual practitioners. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patterns of medical care can be approached using quantitative linguistic techniques, a finding that has implications for the assessment of expertise, machine learning identification of optimal practices, and construction of bedside decision support tools.},

  abstract = {Recently, a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven smart healthcare services are rapidly emerging in the medical market, such as intelligent image analysis, surgical navigation systems, and aided diagnosis. However, one of the major challenges is practitioners' hesitation and unwillingness to employ these new technologies in medical practice. This study focuses on identifying the influential factors of adoption intention of smart healthcare services for both clinicians and non-clinicians from the perspective of technology transfer. Through collecting 484 questionnaire data from doctors in Anhui, China, we find support to show that perceived usefulness (PU), attitude, and the experience of using mHealth are key factors that influence both clinicians and non-clinician's adoption intention. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that subjective norm has a positive effect on only clinicians' behavioural intention (BI) while perceived risk (PR) has a negative impact on only non-clinicians' attitude. Among all the constructs, the experience of using mHealth has the strongest positive effect on doctors' adoption intention on smart healthcare services, a positive impact on the PU and perceived ease of use, and a negative impact on the PR. This study provides an improved understanding of doctors' BI of smart healthcare services, and practice guidance for product development and marketing strategies.},

  abstract = {The load frequency control (LFC) aims to keep the frequency fluctuation of the power grids within certain specified limits, under various load disturbances. However, with the increased usage of renewable energy sources (RESs) in smart grids, it is essential to regulate the conventional power plants, based on renewable energy penetration levels. Moreover, with the decentralized nature of the control operation in smart grids, the communication network between the control center and actuator faces the challenge of random communication delays and packet drops in the form of cyberattacks. In this article, the conventional thermal power plant operations within an LFC have been modified using energy storage elements with an emphasis on maximizing the RES utilization while tackling the problems associated with cyber-physical systems, such as packet drops and random time delays. A filtered proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is tuned in the LFC using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, including random time delays and cyberattacks modeled as random packet drops. The tuned PID control performance in the LFC scheme is tested with synthetic stochastic as well as real profiles of RES and load demands. The numerical analysis has been conducted on two-area LFC model with Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic demand and generation profiles. Note to Practitioners-We are moving toward more renewable energy-based cyber-physical power grids, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the limits of the balance between more renewable energy integration versus changing the prime-mover in thermal power generation units to meet uncertain load demands. This article proposes a new load frequency control (LFC) scheme employing a nonlinear dead-zone element between the control signals and the actuators (prime movers), which allows the utilization of the available renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet the load and then send a set-point change command in the thermal power generators if the RES does not meet the load. The robustness of the smart grid stability is also verified with the denial-of-service (DoS)-type cyberattack, which is represented in the form of high probability of packet drops and stochastic time delays in the communication channels between the control center and the generation units. It is also essential to understand how different stochastic profiles may affect the stability and performance of the tuned LFC loops, under random time delays and packet dropouts. These are quantified using the uncertainty bounds of grid frequency, its rate of change, control inputs, and power exchange between the two areas that are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations with different types of nonstationary load and RES profiles and also using real data to show the effectiveness of the LFC scheme with communication constraints and the resulting imperfections.},

  abstract = {Featured Application DePaaS has the potential to be used as a global, shared platform for availing software defects prediction services by choosing appropriate base project, defect prediction model and prediction granularity. Over time, DePaaS can potentially become a rich source of defects metadata and provide deep insights into developing efficient software defects prediction models. It can promote inter-agency collaboration, data sharing, continuous improvement, and further research into application of artificial intelligence, genetic programming, and other techniques for solving key problems of software engineering. Using artificial intelligence (AI) based software defect prediction (SDP) techniques in the software development process helps isolate defective software modules, count the number of software defects, and identify risky code changes. However, software development teams are unaware of SDP and do not have easy access to relevant models and techniques. The major reason for this problem seems to be the fragmentation of SDP research and SDP practice. To unify SDP research and practice this article introduces a cloud-based, global, unified AI framework for SDP called DePaaS-Defects Prediction as a Service. The article describes the usage context, use cases and detailed architecture of DePaaS and presents the first response of the industry practitioners to DePaaS. In a first of its kind survey, the article captures practitioner's belief into SDP and ability of DePaaS to solve some of the known challenges of the field of software defect prediction. This article also provides a novel process for SDP, detailed description of the structure and behaviour of DePaaS architecture components, six best SDP models offered by DePaaS, a description of algorithms that recommend SDP models, feature sets and tunable parameters, and a rich set of challenges to build, use and sustain DePaaS. With the contributions of this article, SDP research and practice could be unified enabling building and using more pragmatic defect prediction models leading to increase in the efficiency of software testing.},

This part of the population is composed by the highest-risk patients, who are, at the same time, the major users of the healthcare systems. The early identification of this sub-population can really help to improve people's quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. In this paper, we describe a population health management tool based on state-of-the-art intelligent algorithms, starting from administrative and socio-economic data, for the early identification of high-risk patients. The study refers to the population of the Local Health Unit of Central Tuscany in 2015, which amounts to 1,670,129 residents. After a trade-off on machine learning models and on input data, Random Forest applied to 1-year of historical data achieves the best results, outperforming state-of-the-art models. The most important variables for this model, in terms of mean minimal depth, accuracy decrease and Gini decrease, result to be age and some group of drugs, such as high-ceiling diuretics. Thanks to the low inference time and reduced memory usage, the resulting model allows for real-time risk prediction updates whenever new data become available, giving General Practitioners the possibility to early adopt personalised medicine.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision support systems are data analysis software that supports health professionals' decision - making the process to reach their ultimate outcome, taking into account patient information. However, the need for decision support systems cannot be denied because of most activities in the field of health care within the decision-making process. Decision support systems used for diagnosis are designed based on disease due to the complexity of diseases, symptoms, and disease-symptoms relationships. In the design and implementation of clinical decision support systems, mathematical modeling, pattern recognition and statistical analysis techniques of large databases and data mining techniques such as classification are also widely used. Classification of data is difficult in case of the small and/or imbalanced data set and this problem directly affects the classification performance. Small and/or imbalance dataset has become a major problem in data mining because classification algorithms are developed based on the assumption that the data sets are balanced and large enough. Most of the algorithms ignore or misclassify examples of the minority class, focus on the majority class. Most health data are small and imbalanced by nature. Learning from imbalanced and small data sets is an important and unsettled problem. Within the scope of the study, the publicly accessible data set, hepatitis was oversampled by distance-based data generation methods. The oversampled data sets were classified by using four different machine learning algorithms. Considering the classification scores of four different machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree), optimal synthetic data generation rate is recommended.},

Patients typically present multiple complaints, requiring physicians to decide how to balance competing demands. How this time is allocated has implications for patient satisfaction, payments, and quality of care. We investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for automated annotation of medical topics in patient-provider dialog transcripts.We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to predict talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers, support vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential models that integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional random fields, hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent units).Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1) classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1 scores at the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential models had higher classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher precision at the visit level. Independent models had higher recall scores at the visit level compared with sequential models.Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out noisy information from talk-turns. Although the results are promising, more advanced prediction techniques and larger labeled datasets will likely be required to achieve prediction performance appropriate for real-world clinical applications.},

Agreeableness was associated with both positive and negative emotions, and it was positively associated with sociality and functionality. Conscientiousness was negatively related to negative emotions, and it was associated with high functionality, but also with low sociality. Neuroticism was related to negative emotions, but also to high sociality. Openness was positively linked to functionality, but did not predict other attitudes when other proximal predictors were included (e.g. prior use, personal innovativeness). Personal innovativeness in information technology consistently showed positive attitudes toward AI across all four dimensions. These findings provide mixed support for our hypotheses, and we discuss specific implications for future research and practice.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Falls remain one of the most prevalent adverse events in hospitals and are associated with substantial negative health impacts and costs. Approaches to assess patients' fall risk have been implemented in hospitals internationally, ranging from brief screening questions to multifactorial risk assessments and complex prediction models, despite a lack of clear evidence of effect in reducing falls in acute hospital environments. The increasing digitisation of hospital systems provides new opportunities to understand and predict falls using routinely recorded data, with potential to integrate fall prediction models into real-time or near-real-time computerised decision support for clinical teams seeking to mitigate fall risk. However, the use of non-traditional approaches to fall risk prediction, including machine learning using integrated electronic medical records, has not yet been reviewed relative to more traditional fall prediction models. This scoping review will summarise methodologies used to develop existing hospital fall prediction models, including reporting quality assessment., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework and its recent advances, and will be reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews recommendations. Four electronic databases (CINAHL via EBSCOhost, PubMed, IEEE Xplore and Embase) will be initially searched for studies up to 12 November 2020, and searches may be updated prior to final reporting. Additional studies will be identified by reference list review and citation analysis of included studies. No restriction will be placed on the date or language of identified studies. Screening of search results and extraction of data will be performed by two independent reviewers. Reporting quality will be assessed by the adherence to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this study.

  abstract = {Objective Currently, depression diagnosis relies primarily on behavioral symptoms and signs, and treatment is guided by trial and error instead of evaluating associated underlying brain characteristics. Unlike past studies, we attempted to estimate accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response using multiple machine learning methods with inputs of multi-modal imaging and non-imaging whole brain and network-based features. Methods Late-life depression patients (medicated post-recruitment) (n = 33) and older non-depressed individuals (n = 35) were recruited. Their demographics and cognitive ability scores were recorded, and brain characteristics were acquired using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging pretreatment. Linear and nonlinear learning methods were tested for estimating accurate prediction models. Results A learning method called alternating decision trees estimated the most accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis (87.27\% accuracy) and treatment response (89.47\% accuracy). The diagnosis model included measures of age, Mini-mental state examination score, and structural imaging (e.g. whole brain atrophy and global white mater hyperintensity burden). The treatment response model included measures of structural and functional connectivity. Conclusions Combinations of multi-modal imaging and/or non-imaging measures may help better predict late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response. As a preliminary observation, we speculate that the results may also suggest that different underlying brain characteristics defined by multi-modal imaging measures—rather than region-based differences—are associated with depression versus depression recovery because to our knowledge this is the first depression study to accurately predict both using the same approach. These findings may help better understand late-life depression and identify preliminary steps toward personalized late-life depression treatment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper discusses how an "open science" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems., METHOD: In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings., RESULTS: The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of "black-box" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing., CONCLUSIONS: As AI-based data analysis and clinical decision support systems begin to be implemented in healthcare systems around the world, further openness of clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action may be required by safety-conscious healthcare policy-makers to ensure they are clinically effective in real world use.

Health professionals have used traditional methods in the therapies performed on patients with the aim of improving the expression of emotions by patients. However, they have not been sufficient to detect the different emotions expressed in the face of people according to different sensations. Therefore, different artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to improve the results obtained in these therapies. In this article, we propose the construction of an intelligent mirror to recognize five basic emotions: angry, scared, sad, happy and neutral. This mirror uses convolutional neural networks to analyze the images that are captured by a camera and compare it with the one that the patient should perform, thus supporting the therapies performed by health professionals in children with ASD. The proposal presents the platform and computer architecture, as well as the evaluation by specialists under the technology acceptance model.},

  abstract = {Purpose Innovative firms have rapidly developed artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into their service ecosystems, essentially changing perceptions of what is service quality and service delivery in their respective industries. Nonetheless, the issues surrounding AI services remain relatively unknown. The purpose for this paper is to offer a digital servitization framework for understanding how AI services impact value perceptions, consumer engagement and firm performance measures. The authors use the financial service ecosystem to explore this topic. Design/methodology/approach The authors explore relevant literature on digital servitization, service-dominant logic and AI/disruptive innovation. Next, a conceptual framework, organized by AI-Service Exchange Antecedents, Context of AI Usage and Digital Servitization Consequences, is developed. The authors conceptualize consequences for consumers and firms. Findings The main findings suggest that the linkages between consumers, financial institutions and fintech companies with AI usage in a service ecosystem should be identified; how value is created among multiple SD Logic-AI network actors should be analyzed; and the effects of AI-consumer interactions (lower-level and higher levels of engagement) on firm performance measures should be explored. Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework identifies gaps in the literature and suggests research questions for future studies. Practical implications This paper may assist practitioners with the development of AI-enabled banking activities that involve direct consumer engagement. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, this research agenda is the first comprehensive framework for understanding value co-creation in the context of AI in financial services, linking antecedents, usage and consequences.},

  abstract = {Background. Some Internet interventions are regarded as effective treatments for adult depression, but less is known about who responds to this form of treatment. Method. An elastic net and random forest were trained to predict depression symptoms and related disability after an 8-week course of an Internet intervention, Deprexis, involving adults (N = 283) from across the USA. Candidate predictors included psychopathology, demographics, treatment expectancies, treatment usage, and environmental context obtained from population databases. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R-2 (R-pred(2)), the expected variance explained in a new sample, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Results. An ensemble model was created by averaging the predictions of the elastic net and random forest. Model performance was compared with a benchmark linear autoregressive model that predicted each outcome using only its baseline. The ensemble predicted more variance in post-treatment depression (8.0\% gain, 95\% CI 0.8-15; total R-pred(2) = 0.25), disability (5.0\% gain, 95\% CI -0.3 to 10; total R-pred(2)= 0.25), and well-being (11.6\% gain, 95\% CI 4.9-19; total R-pred(2)= 0.29) than the benchmark model. Important predictors included comorbid psychopathology, particularly total psychopathology and dysthymia, low symptom-related disability, treatment credibility, lower access to therapists, and time spent using certain Deprexis modules. Conclusion. A number of variables predict symptom improvement following an Internet intervention, but each of these variables makes relatively small contributions. Machine learning ensembles may be a promising statistical approach for identifying the cumulative contribution of many weak predictors to psychosocial depression treatment response.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. To decrease the high case fatality rates and morbidity for sepsis and septic shock, there is a need to increase the accuracy of early detection of suspected sepsis in prehospital and emergency department settings. This may be achieved by developing risk prediction decision support systems based on artificial intelligence., METHODS: The overall aim of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on existing methods for early detection of sepsis using artificial intelligence. The review will be performed using the framework formulated by Arksey and O'Malley and further developed by Levac and colleagues. To identify primary studies and reviews that are suitable to answer our research questions, a comprehensive literature collection will be compiled by searching several sources. Constrictions regarding time and language will have to be implemented. Therefore, only studies published between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2020 will be taken into consideration, and foreign language publications will not be considered, i.e., only papers with full text in English will be included. Databases/web search engines that will be used are PubMed, Web of Science Platform, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and ACM Digital Library. Furthermore, clinical studies that have completed patient recruitment and reported results found in the database ClinicalTrials.gov will be considered. The term artificial intelligence is viewed broadly, and a wide range of machine learning and mathematical models suitable as base for decision support will be evaluated. Two members of the team will test the framework on a sample of included studies to ensure that the coding framework is suitable and can be consistently applied. Analysis of collected data will provide a descriptive summary and thematic analysis. The reported results will convey knowledge about the state of current research and innovation for using artificial intelligence to detect sepsis in early phases of the medical care chain., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The methodology used here is based on the use of publicly available information and does not need ethical approval. It aims at aiding further research towards digital solutions for disease detection and health innovation. Results will be extracted into a review report for submission to a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Results will be shared with relevant local and national authorities and disseminated in additional appropriate formats such as conferences, lectures, and press releases.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The heterogeneity of symptoms and complex etiology of depression pose a significant challenge to the personalization of treatment. Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools. Methods: The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria. Results: An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility. Limitations: Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor. Conclusion: Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model. We highlight the importance of large-scale research initiatives and clinically accessible biomarkers, as well as the need for replication studies of current findings. In addition, we provide recommendations for future improvement and standardization of research efforts in this field.},

  abstract = {Background: Advanced stages of different renal diseases feature glomerular sclerosis at a histological level which is observed by light microscopy on tissue samples obtained by performing a kidney biopsy. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare to support physicians in the diagnostic process. Method(s): We propose a novel CAD system that processes histological images and discriminates between sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. To this goal, we designed, tested, and compared two artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. The former implements a shallow ANN classifying hand-crafted features extracted from Regions of Interest (ROIs) by means of image-processing procedures. The latter, instead, employs the IBM Watson Visual Recognition System, which uses a deep artificial neural network making decisions taking the images as input, without the need to design any procedure for describing images with features. The input dataset consisted of 428 sclerotic glomeruli and 2344 non-sclerotic glomeruli derived from images of kidney biopsies scanned by the Aperio ScanScope System. Result(s): Both AI approaches allowed to very accurately distinguish (mean MCC 0.95 and mean Accuracy 0.99) between sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. Although the systems may seem interchangeable, the approach based on feature extraction and classification would allow clinicians to gain information on the most discriminating features. In fact, further procedures could explain the classifier's decision by analysing which subset of features impacted the most on the final decision. Conclusion(s): We developed a customizable support system that can facilitate the work of renal pathologists both in clinical and research settings.

  abstract = {The majority of work on computer use in the dental field has focused on non-clinical practice management information needs. Very few computer-based dental information systems provide management support of the clinical care process, particularly with respect to quality management. Traditional quality assurance methods rely on the paper record and provide only retrospective analysis. Today, proactive quality management initiatives are on the rise. Computer-based dental information systems are being integrated into the care environment, actively providing decision support as patient care is being delivered. These new systems emphasize assessment and improvement of patient care at the time of treatment, thus building internal quality management into the caregiving process. The integration of real time quality management and patient care will be expedited by the introduction of an information system architecture that emulates the gathering and storage of clinical care data currently provided by the paper record. As a proposed solution to the problems associated with existing dental record systems, the computer-based patient record has emerged as a possible alternative to the paper dental record. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently conducted a study on improving the efficiency and accuracy of patient record keeping. As a result of this study, the IOM advocates the development and implementation of computer-based patient records as the standard for all patient care records. This project represents the ongoing efforts of The University of Iowa College of Dentistry's collaboration with the University of Uppsala Data Center, Uppsala, Sweden, on a computer-based patient dental record model. ICOHR (Intelligent Computer Based Oral Health Record) is an information system which brings together five important parts of the patient's dental record: medical and dental history; oral status; treatment planning; progress notes; and a Patient Care Database, generated from their clinical care information (the database is also stored in the ICOHR). ICOHR is designed to be integrated into a traditional practice management system. The components of the ICOHR system support the use of various types of clinical care quality management tools, including medical alerts, clinical care guidelines, care modifiers, and diagnostic decision support. Data input is multimodal, so the user may use both voice recognition and direct input with a digitizer board to enter information into the database. ICOHR is designed to be integrated into the clinical environment in an ergonomic fashion in order to facilitate the unobtrusive and efficient acquisition of patient information. ICOHR is currently under clinical evaluation in both private practice and institutional environments. The private practice is a large general dentistry practice with over twenty sites scattered throughout a large metropolitan area. The institutional settings are a College of Dentistry and a Hospital Dentistry program. The evaluations have started in two of the sites and the other site will be phased in during the next six months. Our demonstration of the system will include both prepared presentations of the system's various functions and provide an opportunity for hands-on use of the system for interested attendees.},

  abstract = {The majority of work on computer use in the dental field has focused on non-clinical practice management information needs. Very few computer-based dental information systems provide management support of the clinical care process, particularly with respect to quality management. Traditional quality assurance methods rely on the paper record and provide only retrospective analysis. Today, proactive quality management initiatives are on the rise. Computer-based dental information systems are being integrated into the care environment, actively providing decision support as patient care is being delivered. These new systems emphasize assessment and improvement of patient care at the time of treatment, thus building internal quality management into the caregiving process. The integration of real time quality management and patient care will be expedited by the introduction of an information system architecture that emulates the gathering and storage of clinical care data currently provided by the paper record. As a proposed solution to the problems associated with existing dental record systems, the computer-based patient record has emerged as a possible alternative to the paper dental record. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently conducted a study on improving the efficiency and accuracy of patient record keeping. As a result of this study, the IOM advocates the development and implementation of computer-based patient records as the standard for all patient care records.

  abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support diagnostic decision-making is rapidly expanding in health care. However, important challenges remain in executing algorithmic systems at the frontlines of clinical practice. Hence, most often, these systems have not been trained with local data nor do they fit with context-specific patterns of care. This research examines the implementation of an AI-based decision support system (DSS) in the emergency department of a large Academic Health Center (AHC) in Canada, focusing specifically on the question of end-user adoption. Based in an interpretative perspective, the study analyzes the perceptions of healthcare managers, AI developers, physicians and nurses on the DSS, so as to make sense of the main barriers to its adoption by emergency physicians. The study points to the importance of considering interconnections between technical, human and organizational factors to better grasp the unique challenges raised by AI systems in health care. It further emphasizes the need to investigate actors' perceptions of AI in order to develop strategies to adequately test and adapt AI systems, and ensure that they meet the needs of health professionals and patients. This research is particularly relevant at a time when considerable investments are being made to develop and deploy AI-based systems in health care. Empirically probing the conditions under which AI-based systems can effectively be integrated into processes and workflow is essential for maximizing the benefits these investments can bring to the organization and delivery of care.},

  abstract = {Background: Current text mining tools supporting abstract screening in systematic reviews are not widely used, in part because they lack sensitivity and precision. We set out to develop an accessible, semi-automated "workflow" to conduct abstract screening for systematic reviews and other knowledge synthesis methods. Methods: We adopt widely recommended text-mining and machine-learning methods to (1) process title-abstracts into numerical training data; and (2) train a classification model to predict eligible abstracts. The predicted abstracts are screened by human reviewers for ("true") eligibility, and the newly eligible abstracts are used to identify similar abstracts, using near-neighbor methods, which are also screened. These abstracts, as well as their eligibility results, are used to update the classification model, and the above steps are iterated until no new eligible abstracts are identified. The workflow was implemented in R and evaluated using a systematic review of insulin formulations for type-1 diabetes (14,314 abstracts) and a scoping review of knowledge-synthesis methods (17,200 abstracts). Workflow performance was evaluated against the recommended practice of screening abstracts by 2 reviewers, independently. Standard measures were examined: sensitivity (inclusion of all truly eligible abstracts), specificity (exclusion of all truly ineligible abstracts), precision (inclusion of all truly eligible abstracts among all abstracts screened as eligible), F1-score (harmonic average of sensitivity and precision), and accuracy (correctly predicted eligible or ineligible abstracts). Workload reduction was measured as the hours the workflow saved, given only a subset of abstracts needed human screening. Results: With respect to the systematic and scoping reviews respectively, the workflow attained 88\%/89\% sensitivity, 99\%/99\% specificity, 71\%/72\% precision, an F1-score of 7996/79\%, 98\%/97\% accuracy, 63\%/55\% workload reduction, with 12\%/11\% fewer abstracts for full-text retrieval and screening, and 0\%/1.5\% missed studies in the completed reviews. Conclusion: The workflow was a sensitive, precise, and efficient alternative to the recommended practice of screening abstracts with 2 reviewers. All eligible studies were identified in the first case, while 6 studies (1.5\%) were missed in the second that would likely not impact the review's conclusions. We have described the workflow in language accessible to reviewers with limited exposure to natural language processing and machine learning, and have made the code available to reviewers.},

Accordingly, it seems important to identify and document the coronaviruses in animal reservoirs, many of which are uncharacterized and potentially missed by more standard diagnostic assays. A combination of sensitive deep sequencing technology and computational algorithms is essential for virus surveillance, especially for characterizing novel-or distantly related virus strains. Here, we explore the use of profile Hidden Markov Model-defined Pfam protein domains (Pfam domains) encoded by new sequences as a Coronaviridae sequence classification tool. The encoded domains are used first in a triage to identify potential Coronaviridae sequences and then processed using a Random Forest method to classify the sequences to the Coronaviridae genus level. The application of this algorithm on Coronaviridae genomes assembled from agnostic deep sequencing data from surveillance of bats and rats in Dong Thap province (Vietnam) identified thirty-four Alphacoronavirus and eleven Betacoronavirus genomes. This collection of bat and rat coronaviruses genomes provided essential information on the local diversity of coronaviruses and substantially expanded the number of coronavirus full genomes available from bat and rats and may facilitate further molecular studies on this group of viruses.},

  abstract = {Background: Research on intentions to use telemedicine in primary care is sparse. This survey study explored primary care physicians' intentions to use telemedicine by using a newly developed questionnaire: Physician Attitudes and Intentions to use Telemedicine. Methods: An anonymous web-survey with questions focusing on theory-based predictors of behavioral intentions such as Attitudes, Subjective norms and Perceived behavioral control was designed, validated, and sent to all primary care physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The questionnaire had 29 subject items (including 49 multiple-choice sub-items). Main outcome measures were intentions to use three domains of telemedicine and correlation between theory-based predictors and behavioral intentions for using telemedicine. Results: The survey was validated by an expert group, amended, and then tested and retested. A majority of the 198 physicians who returned the web-surveys reported that they did not use e-mails (68\%), nor video consultations (78\%), chat (81\%), or text messages (86\%) in their everyday patient work. Yet, most physicians described a positive intention to use telemedicine in patient care for all three studied domains with Attitudes and Perceived behavioral control being significant predictors (p{$<$}0.01) for Intentions to use digital contacts (R-2 = 0.54), chronic disease monitoring with digital tools (R-2 = 0.47) and artificial intelligence (R-2 = 0.54). A structural validation of a preliminary instrument - Physician Attitudes and Intention to use Telemedicine (PAIT) - containing 28 sub-items was done by exploratory factor analysis with acceptable explanatory, reliability and sampling adequacy measures. Five factors emerged with Eigenvalues between 1.6 and 11.1 explaining 72\% of the variance. Total Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkirk 0.79. Conclusion: Before the covid-19 pandemic, Swedish primary care physicians reported a low use yet high behavioral intention to use telemedicine in a study where we developed the preliminary instrument Physician Attitudes and Intention to use Telemedicine. Perceived behavioral control had the largest predictive value of behavioral intention to use telemedicine. Thus, interventions aiming to increase the use of digital tools in primary care should possibly focus on empowering physicians' self-efficacy towards using them.},

Design/methodology/approach To understand the customers' behavioral intention and AUE of AI-powered chatbots for tourism, the mixed-method design was used whereby qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. A total of 36 senior managers and executives from the travel agencies were interviewed and the analysis of interview data was done using NVivo 8.0 software. A total of 1,480 customers were surveyed and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Findings As per the results, the predictors of chatbot adoption intention (AIN) are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived trust (PTR), perceived intelligence (PNT) and anthropomorphism (ANM). Technological anxiety (TXN) does not influence the chatbot AIN. Stickiness to traditional human travel agents negatively moderates the relation of AIN and AUE of chatbots in tourism and provides deeper insights into manager's commitment to providing travel planning services using AI-based chatbots. Practical implications This research presents unique practical insights to the practitioners, managers and executives in the tourism industry, system designers and developers of AI-based chatbot technologies to understand the antecedents of chatbot adoption by travelers. TXN is a vital concern for the customers; so, designers and developers should ensure that chatbots are easily accessible, have a user-friendly interface, be more human-like and communicate in various native languages with the customers. Originality/value This study contributes theoretically by extending the TAM to provide better explanatory power with human-robot interaction context-specific constructs - PTR, PNT, ANM and TXN - to examine the customers' chatbot AIN. This is the first step in the direction to empirically test and validate a theoretical model for chatbots' adoption and usage, which is a disruptive technology in the hospitality and tourism sector in an emerging economy such as India.},

Instability can be intuitively defined as the overt manifestation of the failure of the host to adequately respond to cardiorespiratory stress. The enormous volume of patient data available in ICU environments, both of high-frequency numeric and waveform data accessible from bedside monitors, plus Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, presents a platform ripe for Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for the detection and forecasting of instability, and data-driven intelligent clinical decision support (CDS). Building unbiased, reliable, and usable AI-based systems across health care sites is rapidly becoming a high priority, specifically as these systems relate to diagnostics, forecasting, and bedside clinical decision support. The ICU environment is particularly well-positioned to demonstrate the value of AI in saving lives. The goal is to create AI models embedded in a real-time CDS for forecasting and mitigation of critical instability in ICU patients of sufficient readiness to be deployed at the bedside. Such a system must leverage multi-source patient data, machine learning, systems engineering, and human action expertise, the latter being key to successful CDS implementation in the clinical workflow and evaluation of bias. We present one approach to create an operationally relevant AI-based forecasting CDS system.},

Recently, the evolution of machine learning techniques has helped greatly to develop tools assisting doctors to predict mental disorders and support patient care. In this work, a comparative literature search was conducted on research for the prediction of specic types of anxiety disorders, using machine learning techniques. Sixteen (16) studies were selected and examined, revealing that machine learning techniques can be used for eectively predicting anxiety disorders. The accuracy of the results varies according to the type of anxiety disorder and the type of methods utilized for predicting the disorder. We can deduce that signicant work has been done on the prediction of anxiety using machine learning techniques. However, in the future we may achieve higher accuracy scores and that could lead to a better treatment support for patients.

  abstract = {Objectives To assess undergraduate medical students’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology and medicine. Materials and methods Aweb-based questionnaire was designed using SurveyMonkey, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students’ prior knowledge of AI in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards AI in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52\% were aware of the ongoing discussion about AI in radiology and 68\% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83\%) but felt that AI would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56\%). The majority agreed that AI will revolutionise and improve radiology (77\% and 86\%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83\%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for AI to be included in medical training (71\%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of AI and less fearful of these technologies. Conclusion Contrary to anecdotes published in the media, undergraduate medical students do not worry that AI will replace human radiologists, and are aware of the potential applications and implications of AI on radiology and medicine. Radiology should take the lead in educating students about these emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {Background: The high volume of data in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and the lack of agreement on how to best implement it in screening programs makes its use challenging. Purpose(s): To compare radiologist performance when reading single-view wide-angle DBT images with and without an artificial intelligence (AI) system for decision and navigation support. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective observer study was performed with bilateral mediolateral oblique examinations and corresponding synthetic two-dimensional images acquired between June 2016 and February 2018 with a wide-angle DBT system. Fourteen breast screening radiologists interpreted 190 DBT examinations (90 normal, 26 with benign findings, and 74 with malignant findings), with the reference standard being verified by using histopathologic analysis or at least 1 year of follow-up. Reading was performed in two sessions, separated by at least 4 weeks, with a random mix of examinations being read with and without AI decision and navigation support. Forced Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (categories 1-5) and level of suspicion (1-100) scores were given per breast by each reader. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the sensitivity and specificity were compared between conditions by using the public-domain iMRMC software. The average reading times were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Result(s): The 190 women had a median age of 54 years (range, 48-63 years). The examination-based reader-averaged AUC was higher when interpreting results with AI support than when reading unaided (0.88 [95\% CI: 0.84, 0.92] vs 0.85 [95\% CI: 0.80, 0.89], respectively; P = .01). The average sensitivity increased with AI support (64 of 74, 86\% [95\% CI: 80\%, 92\%] vs 60 of 74, 81\% [95\% CI: 74\%, 88\%]; P = .006), whereas no differences in the specificity (85 of 116, 73.3\% [95\% CI: 65\%, 81\%] vs 83 of 116, 71.6\% [95\% CI: 65\%, 78\%]; P = .48) or reading time (48 seconds vs 45 seconds; P = .35) were detected. Conclusion(s): Using a single-view digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and artificial intelligence setup could allow for a more effective screening program with higher performance, especially in terms of an increase in cancers detected, than using single-view DBT alone.Copyright © 2021 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

SMART is able to retrieve a protocol from its knowledge base and to monitor its execution step by step for a single patient. Different protocols for different patients can be followed at the same time in a health care structure. The prototype realized supports the execution of protocols for evaluating surgical risks. It has been implemented according to the specifications given by the 4th Surgical Clinic of "Policlinico Umberto I" and reflects the activities actually performed in that hospital.

  abstract = {Objectives Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed based on early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social communication. We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis. Methods Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were included for replication. Results High classification accuracy was achieved through several rs-fMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67\%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak accuracy 95.19\%). The class probability estimates, P(ASD|fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning. Conclusions While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing.},

In this article we present a software tool that has been developed to address the elusive issue of sensor distribution within smart homes. Details of the tool will be presented and it will be shown how it can be used to emulate any real world environment whereby virtual sensor distributions can be rapidly implemented and assessed without the requirement for physical deployment for evaluation. As such, this approach offers the potential of tailoring sensor distributions to the specific needs of a patient in a non-evasive manner.

Notably, many underwater tasks, including the assessment of subsea infrastructure, are performed with the assistance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). There have been recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, notably, Deep Learning (DL) models and applications, which have widespread usage in a variety of fields, including aerial unmanned vehicles, autonomous car navigation, and other applications. However, they are not as prevalent in underwater applications due to the difficulty of obtaining underwater datasets for a specific application. In this sense, the current study utilises recent advancements in the area of DL to construct a bespoke dataset generated from photographs of items captured in a laboratory environment. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were utilised to translate the laboratory object dataset into the underwater domain by combining the collected images with photographs containing the underwater environment. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of creating such a dataset, since the resulting images closely resembled the real underwater environment when compared with real-world underwater ship hull images. Therefore, the artificial datasets of the underwater environment can overcome the difficulties arising from the limited access to real-world underwater images and are used to enhance underwater operations through underwater object image classification and detection.},

  abstract = {Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective(s): This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Method(s): This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Result(s): In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusion(s): This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Characterising the demographics and choice of activity type within the identified clusters of behaviour. Across all seven clusters of seasonal activity behaviour identified, daylight saving was shown to play a key role in influencing behaviour, with increased activity in summer months. Investigation into weekly behaviours identified six clusters with varied roles, of weekday versus weekend, on the likelihood of meeting physical activity guidelines. Preferred type of physical activity likewise varied between clusters, with gender and age strongly associated with cluster membership. Key relationships are identified between weekly clusters and seasonal activity behaviour clusters, demonstrating how short-term behaviours contribute to longer-term activity patterns. Utilising unsupervised machine learning, this study demonstrates how the volume and richness of secondary app data can allow us to move away from aggregate measures of physical activity to better understand temporal variations in habitual physical activity behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently, machine learning (ML) has been transforming our daily lives by enabling intelligent voice assistants, personalized support for purchase decisions, and efficient credit card fraud detection. In addition to its everyday applications, ML holds the potential to improve medicine as well, especially with regard to diagnostics in clinics. In a world characterized by population growth, demographic change, and the global COVID-19 pandemic, ML systems offer the opportunity to make diagnostics more effective and efficient, leading to a high interest of clinics in such systems. However, despite the high potential of ML, only a few ML systems have been deployed in clinics yet, as their adoption process differs significantly from the integration of prior health information technologies given the specific characteristics of ML. Objective: This study aims to explore the factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics to foster the adoption of these systems in clinics. Furthermore, this study provides insight into how these factors can be used to determine the ML maturity score of clinics, which can be applied by practitioners to measure the clinic status quo in the adoption process of ML systems. Methods: To gain more insight into the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics, we conducted a qualitative study by interviewing 22 selected medical experts from clinics and their suppliers with profound knowledge in the field of ML. We used a semistructured interview guideline, asked open-ended questions, and transcribed the interviews verbatim. To analyze the transcripts, we first used a content analysis approach based on the health care-specific framework of nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability. Then, we drew on the results of the content analysis to create a maturity model for ML adoption in clinics according to an established development process. Results: With the help of the interviews, we were able to identify 13 ML-specific factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems in clinics. We categorized these factors according to 7 domains that form a holistic ML adoption framework for clinics. In addition, we created an applicable maturity model that could help practitioners assess their current state in the ML adoption process. Conclusions: Many clinics still face major problems in adopting ML systems for medical diagnostics; thus, they do not benefit from the potential of these systems. Therefore, both the ML adoption framework and the maturity model for ML systems in clinics can not only guide future research that seeks to explore the promises and challenges associated with ML systems in a medical setting but also be a practical reference point for clinicians.},

  abstract = {Zoonotic diseases affect resource-poor tropical communities disproportionately, and are linked to human use and modification of ecosystems. Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global "One Health" initiative, predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on narrow ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory, co-production approach to address this disconnect between science, policy and implementation, by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors, to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014-2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors, including forest cover and loss, host densities and public health access, in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga, Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics, livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014-2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an "ecotonal" disease, landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019, indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use, and public health interventions. We argue this inter-disciplinary approach to risk prediction is applicable across zoonotic diseases in tropical settings.},

The present study analyzes the effects of reused saline water in the irrigation of radish culture and the construction of a fuzzy logical mathematic model so that producers may evaluate their production. The experiment, measuring the development of radish bulb at five saline water levels, was developed in a greenhouse in the Botucatu, Campus of the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Botucatu/SP, Brazil. Results showed that salinity caused reduction in fresh and dry matter of the bulb and affected ratings throughout the culture cycle. From the developed fuzzy model, it was possible to verify that the fuzzy modeling helps in the analysis of the experimental data and makes it possible to perform simulations capable of inferring points that were not experimentally determined.},

In particular, for its noninvasive and ubiquitous character by nature, CA-based applications in healthcare have increasingly attracted attention in recent years. During the tough time of the global crisis caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), scientists and engineers in data science have collaborated to think of novel ways in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, tracking, and management of this global pandemic. On the one hand, we have witnessed the power of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in applications of epidemiology modeling, drug and/or vaccine finding and designing, fast CT screening, and quarantine management. On the other hand, relevant studies in exploring the capacity of CA are extremely lacking and underestimated. To this end, we propose a novel multitask speech corpus for COVID-19 research usage. We collected 51 confirmed COVID-19 patients' in-the-wild speech data in Wuhan city, China. We define three main tasks in this corpus, i.e., three-category classification tasks for evaluating the physical and/or mental status of patients, i.e., sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety. The benchmarks are given by using both classic machine learning methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. We believe this study and corpus cannot only facilitate the ongoing research on using data science to fight against COVID-19, but also the monitoring of contagious diseases for general purpose.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common reasons for blindness in the world today. The most common treatment for wet AMD is the intravitreal injections for inhibiting vascular-endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF). This treatment usually involves multiple injections and thus multiple clinic visits, which not only causes increased cost on national health services but also causes exposure to the hospital environment, which is sometimes high risk considering current COVID crisis. The treatment, in spite of the above concerns, is usually effective. However, in some cases, either the medicine fails to produce the anticipated favourable outcome, resulting in waste of time, medication, efforts, and above all, psychological distress to the patients. Hence, early predictability of anatomical as well as functional effectiveness of the treatment appears to be a very desirable capability to have. Method A machine learning approach using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) of two-sample prediction model has been presented that requires only the baseline measurements and changes in visual acuity (VA) as well as macular thickness (MAC) after four months of treatment to estimate the values of VA and MAC at 8 and 12 months. In contrast to most of the AI techniques, ANFIS approach has shown the capability of the algorithm to work with very small dataset as well, which makes it a perfect candidate for the presented solution. Results The presented model has shown to have a very high accuracy ({$>$} 92\%) and works in near-real-time scenarios. It has been converted into a smart phone App, Ophnosis(AMD), for convenient usage. With this App, the clinician can visualize the progression of the patient for a specific treatment and can decide on continuing or changing the treatment accordingly. The complete AI engine developed with the ANFIS algorithm is localized to the phone through the App, implying that there is no need for intemet or cloud connectivity for this App to function. This makes it ideal for remote usage, especially under the current COVID scenarios. Conclusions With a smart AI-based App on their fingertips, the presented system provides ample opportunity to the doctors to make a better decision based on the estimated progression, if the same drug is continued with (good/fair prognosis) or alternate treatment should be sought (bad prognosis). From a functional point of view, a prediction algorithm is triggered through simple entry of the relevant parameters (baseline and 4 months only). No internet/cloud connectivity is needed since the algorithm and the trained network are fully embedded in the App locally. Hence, using the App in remote and/or non-connected isolated areas is possible, especially in the secluded patients during the COVID scenarios. [GRAPHICS] .},

Multi-material coatings composed of Silicon Substituted Hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) and Silver Substituted Hydroxyapatite (Ag-HA) potentiated its usage as an ideal bone implant material with favourable biological response and antibacterial properties, respectively. Each patient has different conditions (e.g. bone ages, bone density, position, and infection status) and specific bone implant requirement, thus requiring specific designs of Si-HA and Ag-HA bone implant material ratios. In this paper, a recommender system which took advantage of Wide\&Deep recommendation architecture and DenseNet architecture was provided and a semi-supervised training process was utilized to recommend appropriate bone implant material ratio (SiHA:Ag-HA) for each patient to improve the bone disease treatment and recovery. The proposed recommendation system could achieve high accuracy (92.2\%) and efficiency (using only 10\% of labeled data) on test dataset, which could be potentially utilized in future clinical usages and provide doctors with decision support to make better clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a methodology for achieving an efficient implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Three main steps are illustrated: knowledge representation, model simulation and implementation within a health care organisation. The resulting system can be classified as a 'guideline-based careflow management system'. It is based on computational formalisms representing both medical and health care organisational knowledge. This aggregation allows the implementation of a guideline, not only as a simple reminder, but also as an 'organiser' that facilitates health care processes. As a matter of fact, the system not only suggests the tasks to be performed, but also the resource allocation. The methodology initially comprehends a graphical editor, that allows an unambiguous representation of the guideline. Then the guideline is translated into a high-level Petri net. The resources, both human and technological necessary for performing guideline-based activities, are also represented by means of an organisational model. This allows the running of the Petri net for simulating the implementation of the guideline in the clinical setting. The purpose of the simulation is to validate the careflow model and to suggest the optimal resource allocation before the careflow system is installed. The final step is the careflow implementation. In this phase, we show that the 'workflow management' technology, widely used in business process automation, may be transferred to the health care setting. This requires augmenting the typical workflow management systems with the flexibility and the uncertainty management, typical of the health care processes. For illustrating the proposed methodology, we consider a guideline for the management of patients with acute ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {Workflow Management Systems integrate domain and organisational knowledge to support business processes. When applied to the medical environment, they can be termed "Careflow Management Systems", and may be used to manage care delivery by enhancing co-operation among healthcare professionals. This paper focuses on care delivery based on clinical practice guidelines. Healthcare organisations are very different from industrial or commercial companies: their main goal is not profit, but maintaining and improving the health of the public. Therefore, outcomes are difficult to measure. Firstly, physicians, while playing a variety of roles, are quite independent decision-makers; secondly, the object of the process, i.e. the patient, may be involved in choosing treatment options, and may be treated by different institutions. For these reasons, the standard functionality of typical Workflow Management Systems must be strongly enhanced in order to cope with healthcare delivery needs. A major issue is accounting for exceptions. In most non-clinical settings this is not a problem because processes are very well defined and can often be easily controlled by some higher authority. As explained above, this does not happen in healthcare organisations. Responsibilities are widely shared, and health care professionals may be non-compliant with guidelines for a variety of reasons. The paper presents a classification of possible exceptions, and shows how the sequence of tasks described by a guideline may be altered, at the implementation level, in order to meet actual user needs, while maintaining guideline intentions as much as possible. A terminology server is also exploited towards this end. This work illustrates a prototype of a Careflow Management System based on an international guideline for ischemic stroke treatment, developed by the American Heart Association.},

We selected the intended users of the system as study participants: radiology residents and emergency physicians. We found that both groups of users shared a high satisfaction with the system's ease of use, while their perception of output quality (i.e., diagnostic performance) differed notably. The perceived usefulness of the application yielded positive evaluations, focusing on its utility to confirm that no findings were omitted, and also presenting distinct patterns across the two groups of users. Our results highlight the importance of clearly differentiating the intended users of AI applications in clinical workflows, to enable the design of specific modifications that better suit their particular needs.

Our application of theory of planned behavior in technology adoption in ECEC is extraordinarily good, with 66 percent explained variance of actual usage of technology in class. The research literature supports the findings that the intention to use technology and a good attitude toward technology are the most significant determinants of actual technology usage. Although more research is needed in larger and more complex samples to confirm these findings, there is compelling evidence that the prediction methodology can be used to predict preschool teachers' level of technology acceptance and assist educational decision-makers in designing timely interventions that improve the chances of success.

Each account is reviewed to make sure that there is nothing outside the context of a surgery, examination or consultation. The costs of these audits are high and the outcome is varied and according to the auditor's individual knowledge. In addition to being a lengthy process, these bills will only be paid to those who provided the service after the auditors' review which brings dissatisfaction to those awaiting payment.

Less attention has been paid, however, to the scope for, and ethics of, automating decision making within regulatory apparatuses governing the access, use, and exchange of data involving humans for research. In this article, we map how the binary logic flows and real-time capabilities of automated decision support (ADS) systems may be leveraged to accelerate one rate-limiting step in scientific discovery: data access management. We contend that improved auditability, consistency, and efficiency of the data access request process using ADS systems have the potential to yield fairer outcomes in requests for data largely sourced from biospecimens and biobanked samples. This procedural justice rationale reinforces a broader set of participant and data subject rights that data access committees (DACs) indirectly protect. DACs protect the rights of citizens to benefit from science by bringing researchers closer to the data they need to advance that science. DACs also protect the informational dignities of individuals and communities by ensuring the data being accessed are used in ways consistent with participant values. We discuss the development of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Data Use Ontology standard as a test case of ADS for genomic data access management specifically, and we synthesize relevant ethical, legal, and social challenges to its implementation in practice. We conclude with an agenda of future research needed to thoughtfully advance strategies for computational governance that endeavor to instill public trust in, and maximize the scientific value of, health-related human data across data types, environments, and user communities.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) in a pregnant woman is the most serious issue in the field of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, especially in rural India. In recent years, various clinical prediction models for PTB have been developed to improve the accuracy of learning models. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, most of them suffer from selecting the most accurate features from the medical dataset in linear time. The present paper attempts to design a machine learning model named as risk prediction conceptual model (RPCM) for the prediction of PTB. In this paper, a feature selection approach is proposed based on the notion of entropy. The novel approach is used to find the best maternal features (responsible for PTB) from the obstetrical dataset and aims to predict the classifier's accuracy at the highest level. The paper first deals with the review of PTB cases (which is neglected in many developing countries including India). Next, we collect obstetrical data from the Community Health Centre of rural areas (Kamdara, Jharkhand). The suggested approach is then applied on collected data to identify the excellent maternal features (text-based symptoms) present in pregnant women in order to classify all birth cases into term birth and PTB. The machine learning part of the model is implemented using three different classifiers, namely, decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) for PTB prediction. The performance of the classifiers is measured in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Finally, the SVM classifier generates an accuracy of 90.9\%, which is higher than other learning classifiers used in this study.Copyright © 2021 Rakesh Raja et al.},

Objective: To characterize the utilization patterns of primary care patients and create weighted panel sizes for providers based on work required to care for patients with different patterns. Methods: We used EHR data over a 2-year period from patients empaneled to primary care clinicians in a single academic health system, including their in-person encounter history and virtual encounters such as telephonic visits, electronic messaging, and care coordination with specialists. Using a combination of decision rules and k-means clustering, we identified clusters of patients with similar health care system activity. Phenotypes with basic demographic information were used to predict future health care utilization using log-linear models. Phenotypes were also used to calculate weighted panel sizes. Results: We identified 7 primary care utilization phenotypes, which were characterized by various combinations of primary care and specialty usage and were deemed clinically distinct by primary care physicians. These phenotypes, combined with age-sex and primary payer variables, predicted future primary care utilization with R-2 of .394 and were used to create weighted panel sizes. Conclusions: Individual patients' health care utilization may be useful for classifying patients by primary care work effort and for predicting future primary care usage.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is used increasingly in clinical care to improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and health system efficiency. Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past-called protected groups-are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice-specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation-and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle. Machine learning is providing increasingly sophisticated decision support and population-level monitoring, and it should encode principles of justice to ensure that models benefit all patients.},

  abstract = {Background: Family engagement is critical in the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support tools, which will play an increasing role in health care in the future. We sought to understand parental perceptions of computer-assisted health care of children in the emergency department (ED). Method(s): We conducted a population-weighted household panel survey of parents with minor children in their home in a large US city to evaluate perceptions of the use of computer programs for the care of children with respiratory illness. We identified demographics associated with discomfort with AI using survey-weighted logistic regression. Result(s): Surveys were completed by 1620 parents (panel response rate = 49.7\%). Most respondents were comfortable with the use of computer programs to determine the need for antibiotics (77.6\%) or bloodwork (76.5\%), and to interpret radiographs (77.5\%). In multivariable analysis, Black non-Hispanic parents reported greater discomfort with AI relative to White non-Hispanic parents (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.70) as did younger parents (18-25 years) relative to parents {$>$}=46 years (OR 2.48, 95\% CI 1.31-4.67). The greatest perceived benefits of computer programs were finding something a human would miss (64.2\%, 95\% CI 60.9\%-67.4\%) and obtaining a more rapid diagnosis (59.6\%; 56.2\%-62.9\%). Areas of greatest concern were diagnostic errors (63.0\%, 95\% CI 59.6\%-66.4\%), and recommending incorrect treatment (58.9\%, 95\% CI 55.5\%-62.3\%). Conclusion(s): Parents were generally receptive to computer-assisted management of children with respiratory illnesses in the ED, though reservations emerged. Black non-Hispanic and younger parents were more likely to express discomfort about AI.Copyright © 2022 Academic Pediatric Association},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide risk assessment usually involves an interaction between doctors and patients. However, a significant number of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their condition due to the limited access to mental health care facilities; the reduced availability of clinicians; the lack of awareness; and stigma, neglect, and discrimination surrounding mental disorders. In contrast, internet access and social media usage have increased significantly, providing experts and patients with a means of communication that may contribute to the development of methods to detect mental health issues among social media users. Objective: This paper aimed to describe an approach for the suicide risk assessment of Spanish-speaking users on social media. We aimed to explore behavioral, relational, and multimodal data extracted from multiple social platforms and develop machine learning models to detect users at risk. Methods: We characterized users based on their writings, posting patterns, relations with other users, and images posted. We also evaluated statistical and deep learning approaches to handle multimodal data for the detection of users with signs of suicidal ideation (suicidal ideation risk group). Our methods were evaluated over a dataset of 252 users annotated by clinicians. To evaluate the performance of our models, we distinguished 2 control groups: users who make use of suicide-related vocabulary (focused control group) and generic random users (generic control group). Results: We identified significant statistical differences between the textual and behavioral attributes of each of the control groups compared with the suicidal ideation risk group. At a 95\% CI, when comparing the suicidal ideation risk group and the focused control group, the number of friends (P=.04) and median tweet length (P=.04) were significantly different. The median number of friends for a focused control user (median 578.5) was higher than that for a user at risk (median 372.0). Similarly, the median tweet length was higher for focused control users, with 16 words against 13 words of suicidal ideation risk users. Our findings also show that the combination of textual, visual, relational, and behavioral data outperforms the accuracy of using each modality separately. We defined text-based baseline models based on bag of words and word embeddings, which were outperformed by our models, obtaining an increase in accuracy of up to 8\% when distinguishing users at risk from both types of control users. Conclusions: The types of attributes analyzed are significant for detecting users at risk, and their combination outperforms the results provided by generic, exclusively text-based baseline models. After evaluating the contribution of image-based predictive models, we believe that our results can be improved by enhancing the models based on textual and relational features. These methods can be extended and applied to different use cases related to other mental disorders.},

Despite the current limitations of the EHR allergy module, we must encourage improved clinical documentation and demand technological improvements. Telehealth methods have been shown to be valuable in the assessment of ADRs and HSRs, particularly in the case of penicillin allergy evaluation and delabeling.

Blood culture (BC) analyses often result in a low true positive result rate, indicating its improper usage. A predictive model might assist clinicians in deciding for whom to conduct or to avoid BC analysis in patients having a relevant bacteraemia risk. Predictive models were established by using linear and non-linear machine learning methods. To obtain proper data, a unique data set was collected prior to model estimation in a prospective cohort study, screening 3,370 standard care patients with suspected bacteraemia. Data from 466 patients fulfilling two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (bacteraemia rate: 28.8\%) were finally used. A 29 parameter panel of clinical data, cytokine expression levels and standard laboratory markers was used for model training. Model tuning was performed in a ten-fold cross validation and tuned models were validated in a test set (80: 20 random split). The random forest strategy presented the best result in the test set validation (ROC-AUC: 0.729, 95\% CI: 0.679-0.779). However, procalcitonin (PCT), as the best individual variable, yielded a similar ROC-AUC (0.729, 95\% CI: 0.679-0.779). Thus, machine learning methods failed to improve the moderate diagnostic accuracy of PCT.},

However, biomarkers that accurately predict a response to ECT remain unidentified.To investigate whether certain factors identified by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to predict ECT response.In this nonrandomized prospective study, gray matter structure was assessed twice at approximately 6 weeks apart using 3-T MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Patients were recruited through the inpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, from March 11, 2010, to March 27, 2015. Two patient groups with acute major depressive disorder were included. One group received an ECT series in addition to antidepressants (n\,=\,24); a comparison sample was treated solely with antidepressants (n\,=\,23). Both groups were compared with a sample of healthy control participants (n\,=\,21). Binary pattern classification was used to predict ECT response by structural MRI that was performed before treatment. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes.One participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3\% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100\% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x\,=\,8, y\,=\,21, z\,=\,−18; Z\,score, 4.00; P\,\&lt;\,.001; peak voxel r\,=\,0.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x\,=\,−28, y\,=\,−9, z\,=\,−18; Z score, 7.81; P\,\&lt;\,.001) that was missing in the medication-only sample.A relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT. In the future, neuroimaging techniques could prove to be promising tools for predicting the individual therapeutic effectiveness of ECT.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The year 2020 was predominated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective of this article is to review the areas in which clinical information systems (CIS) can be and have been utilized to support and enhance the response of healthcare systems to pandemics, focusing on COVID-19., METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies pertaining to CIS, pandemics, and COVID-19 through October 2020. The most informative and detailed studies were highlighted, while many others were referenced., RESULTS: CIS were heavily relied upon by health systems and governmental agencies worldwide in response to COVID-19. Technology-based screening tools were developed to assist rapid case identification and appropriate triaging. Clinical care was supported by utilizing the electronic health record (EHR) to onboard frontline providers to new protocols, offer clinical decision support, and improve systems for diagnostic testing. Telehealth became the most rapidly adopted medical trend in recent history and an essential strategy for allowing safe and effective access to medical care. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms were developed to enhance screening, diagnostic imaging, and predictive analytics - though evidence of improved outcomes remains limited. Geographic information systems and big data enabled real-time dashboards vital for epidemic monitoring, hospital preparedness strategies, and health policy decision making. Digital contact tracing systems were implemented to assist a labor-intensive task with the aim of curbing transmission. Large scale data sharing, effective health information exchange, and interoperability of EHRs remain challenges for the informatics community with immense clinical and academic potential. CIS must be used in combination with engaged stakeholders and operational change management in order to meaningfully improve patient outcomes., CONCLUSION: Managing a pandemic requires widespread, timely, and effective distribution of reliable information. In the past year, CIS and informaticists made prominent and influential contributions in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright IMIA and Thieme.

Intubation and death were coupled with selected natural killer cell KIR receptor usage and IgM+ B cells and associated with profound CD4 and CD8 T-cell exhaustion. Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of the hierarchy of disease progression revealed dynamic time changes in the global population recapitulating individual patients and the development of an eight-marker classifier of disease severity.

  abstract = {Several barriers complicate access to psychotherapy for depression, including time commitment, location of services, and stigma. Digital treatment has the potential to address these barriers, yet long term use of digital psychotherapy is poor. This paper presents data from a mixed-methods, online survey to document concerns patients with depression face when given the choice of in-person psychotherapy and digital psychotherapy. Participants were 164 adults living in the United States who had previously used or considered psychotherapy for depression. Rural-dwelling and racial/ethnic minority (Native American, African American, and Spanish-speaking) respondents were purposively sampled. Participants were asked their preferences for and opinions about four treatment modalities: self-guided digital, peer-supported digital, expert-guided digital, or in-person psychotherapy. Less than half (44.5\%) of participants preferred in-person psychotherapy, 25.6\% preferred self-guided digital treatment, 19.7\% preferred expert-guided digital treatment, and 8.5\% peer-supported digital treatment. Principal themes extracted from qualitative analysis centered on the efficacy of digital treatment, access to digital treatment, concerns about peer-supported care, confidentiality and privacy concerns, preference for in-person treatment, skepticism about self-guided therapy, and the impact of social anxiety on the use of video-chat based care. Future development of digital psychotherapy will need to address concerns regarding efficacy, privacy, data security, and methods to enhance motivation to use these treatments.},

It is interesting to note that implementing these two technologies promotes more and better automatic control systems that adjust to each user's particular preferences in the home automation area. This work presents Smart Home Control, an intelligent platform that offers fully customized automatic control schemes for a home's domotic devices by obtaining residents' behavior patterns and applying machine learning to the records of state changes of each device connected to the platform. The platform uses machine learning algorithm C4.5 and the Weka API to identify the behavior patterns necessary to build home devices' configuration rules. Besides, an experimental case study that validates the platform's effectiveness is presented, where behavior patterns of smart homes residents were identified according to the IoT devices usage history. The discovery of behavior patterns is essential to improve the automatic configuration schemes of personalization according to the residents' history of device use.},

The disease slipped through containment measures, with the first known case in the United States being identified on January 20th, 2020. In this paper, we utilize survey data from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research and apply several statistical and machine learning models and techniques such as Decision Trees, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Tree Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and Chi-Squared Test to analyze the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline workers in the United States. Through the interpretation of the many models applied to the mental health survey data, we have concluded that the most important factor in predicting the mental health decline of a frontline worker is the healthcare role the individual is in (Nurse, Emergency Room Staff, Surgeon, etc.), followed by the amount of sleep the individual has had in the last week, the amount of COVID-19 related news an individual has consumed on average in a day, the age of the worker, and the usage of alcohol and cannabis.},

In this study, we examine the acceptance and expectation of the Dr. Answer AI software for prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted an online survey for urologists from August 13 to September 18, 2020. The target software is an AI-based clinical software called Dr. Answer AI software, used for prostate cancer diagnosis. We collected data from 86 urologists and conducted a basic statistical and multiple regression analysis using the R package. Results: The compatibility was significantly associated with the intention to use the Dr. Answer AI software. The expected average accuracy for the software ranges from 86.91\% to 87.51\%, and the urologists perceived that the cloud method is suitable to introduce the software. The most desirable function of the software for the specialists is predicting the occurrence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis after radical prostatectomy. Finally, the primary concerns involved the cost, compatibility with existing systems, and obtaining accurate information from the software.Conclusions: Our results present an understanding of the acceptance, expected effects, expected performance, and concerns of software users.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last ten years, the international workshop on knowledge representation for health care (KR4HC) has hosted outstanding contributions of the artificial intelligence in medicine community pertaining to the formalization and representation of medical knowledge for supporting clinical care. Contributions regarding modeling languages, technologies and methodologies to produce these models, their incorporation into medical decision support systems, and practical applications in concrete medical settings have been the main contributions and the basis to define the evolution of this field across Europe and worldwide., OBJECTIVES: Carry out a review of the papers accepted in KR4HC in the 2009-2018 decade, analyze and characterize the topics and trends within this field, and identify challenges for the evolution of the area in the near future., METHODS: We reviewed the title, the abstract, and the keywords of the 112 papers that were accepted to the workshop, identified the medical and technological topics involved in these works, provided a classification of these papers in medical and technological perspectives and obtained the timeline of these topics in order to determine interest growths and declines. The experience of the authors in the field and the evidences after the review were the basis to propose a list of challenges of knowledge representation in health care for the future., RESULTS: The most generic knowledge representation methods are ontologies (31\%), semantic web related formalisms (26\%), decision tables and rules (19\%), logic (14\%), and probabilistic models (10\%). From a medical informatics perspective, knowledge is mainly represented as computer interpretable clinical guidelines (43\%), medical domain ontologies (26\%), and electronic health care records (22\%). Within the knowledge lifecycle, contributions are found in knowledge generation (38\%), knowledge specification (24\%), exception detection and management (12\%), knowledge enactment (8\%), temporal knowledge and reasoning (7\%), and knowledge sharing and maintenance (7\%). The clinical emphasis of knowledge is mainly related to clinical treatments (27\%), diagnosis (13\%), clinical quality indicators (13\%), and guideline integration for multimorbid patients (12\%). According to the level of development of the works presented, we distinguished four maturity levels: formal (22\%), implementation (52\%), testing (13\%), and deployment (2\%) levels. Some papers described technologies for specific clinical issues or diseases, mainly cancer (22\%) and diseases of the circulatory system (20\%). Chronicity and comorbidity were present in 10\% and 8\% of the papers, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: KR4HC is a stable community, still active after ten years. A persistent focus has been knowledge representation, with an emphasis on semantic-web ontologies and on clinical-guideline based decision-support. Among others, two topics receive growing attention: integration of computer-interpretable guideline knowledge for the management of multimorbidity patients, and patient empowerment and patient-centric care.

Characterizing patient attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI and the factors that lead to these attitudes can help ensure patient values are in close alignment with the implementation of these new technologies. Methods We conducted 15 focus groups with adult patients who had a recent primary care visit at a large academic health center. Using modified grounded theory, focus-group data was analyzed for themes related to the formation of attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI. Results When evaluating AI in healthcare, we found that patients draw on a variety of factors to contextualize these new technologies including previous experiences of illness, interactions with health systems and established health technologies, comfort with other information technology, and other personal experiences. We found that these experiences informed normative and cultural beliefs about the values and goals of healthcare technologies that patients applied when engaging with AI. The results of this study form the basis for a theoretical framework for understanding patient orientation to applications of AI in healthcare, highlighting a number of specific social, health, and technological experiences that will likely shape patient opinions about future healthcare AI applications. Conclusions Understanding the basis of patient attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI is a crucial first step in effective patient engagement and education. The theoretical framework we present provides a foundation for future studies examining patient opinions about applications of AI in healthcare.},

  abstract = {The psychiatric diagnostic procedure is currently based on self-reports that are subject to personal biases. Therefore, the diagnostic process would benefit greatly from data-driven tools that can enhance accuracy and specificity. In recent years, many studies have achieved promising results in detecting and diagnosing depression based on machine learning (ML) analysis. Despite these favorable results in depression diagnosis, which are primarily based on ML analysis of neuroimaging data, most patients do not have access to neuroimaging tools. Hence, objective assessment tools are needed that can be easily integrated into the routine psychiatric diagnostic process. One solution is to use behavioral data, which can be easily collected while still maintaining objectivity. The current paper summarizes the main ML-based approaches that use behavioral data in diagnosing depression and other psychiatric disorders. We classified these studies into two main categories: (a) laboratory-based assessments and (b) data mining, the latter of which we further divided into two sub-groups: (i) social media usage and movement sensors data and (ii) demographic and clinical information. The paper discusses the advantages and challenges in this field and suggests future research directions and implementations. The paper’s overarching aim is to serve as a first step in synthetizing existing knowledge about ML-based behavioral diagnosis studies in order to develop interventions and individually tailored treatments in the future.},

Accurate EMR-based machine learning models have been developed to predict HIV diagnosis, retention in care, and viral suppression. Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes and data sharing between healthcare systems and public health agencies can enhance models for identifying people living with HIV who are undiagnosed or in need of relinkage to care. Challenges related to using these technologies include inconsistent EMR documentation, alert fatigue, and the potential for bias. Clinical informatics and machine learning models are promising tools for improving HIV care continuum outcomes. Future research should focus on methods for combining EMR data with additional data sources (e.g., social media, geospatial data) and studying how to effectively implement predictive models for HIV care into clinical practice.},

Oral and oropharyngeal cancer risk assessment identifies individual risk factors while providing support to reduce risk. The objective is to examine potential current and future strategies to broadly implement evidence-based oral and oropharyngeal cancer risk assessment and screening in dental practices throughout the United States. Method(s): Feasible and effective oral cancer risk assessment and risk reduction strategies, ripe for implementation in dental practice, were identified in the published literature. Result(s): The Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) model is a feasible approach to assessing individual oral cancer risk and providing risk reducing interventions in the dental setting. HPV is a more recently identified risk factor that dentistry is well positioned to address. Evidence supporting the utilization of specific risk assessment tools and risk reduction strategies is summarized and future opportunities discussed. Discussion(s): Current knowledge of risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancers support the recommendation for dental providers to routinely assess all patients for risk factors, educate them about their personal level of cancer risk, and recommend actions to reduce relevant risk factors. Individuals ages 9-26 should be asked about their HPV vaccination status, educated about HPV and oropharyngeal cancer and receive a recommendation to get the HPV vaccination.Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Lifecycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management.

It is envisioned that such a dataset could be a resource for the assessment of CT image quality, machine learning, and imaging technologies [e.g.,computer aided detection (CAD) and segmentation algorithms]. Acquisition and validation methodsThis HIPPA compliant, IRB waiver of approval study consisted of utilizing 120 chest and 100 abdominal clinically acquired adult CT exams. One image series per patient exam was utilized based on coverage of the anatomical region of interest (either the thorax or abdomen). All image series were de-identified. Simulated lesions were derived from a library of anatomically informed digital lesions (93 lung and 50 liver lesions) where six and four digital lesions with nominal diameters ranging from 4 to 20mm were inserted into lung and liver image series, respectively. Locations for lesion insertion were randomly chosen. A previously validated lesion simulation and virtual insertion technique were utilized. The resulting hybrid images were reviewed by three experienced radiologists to assure similarity with routine clinical imaging in a diverse adult population. Data format and usage notesThe database is composed of four datasets that contain 100 patient cases each, for a total of 400 image series accompanied by Matlab.mat tables that provide descriptive information about the virtually inserted lesions (i.e., size, shape, opacity, and insertion location in physical (world) coordinates and voxel indices). All image and metadata are stored in DICOM format on the Quantitative Imaging Data Warehouse (), in two sets: (a) QIBA CT Hybrid Dataset I which contains Lung I and Liver I datasets, and (b) QIBA CT Hybrid Dataset II which contains Lung II and Liver II datasets. The QIDW is supported by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Registration is required upon initial log in. Potential applicationsBy simulating lesion opacity (full solid, part solid and ground glass), size, and texture, the relationship between lesion morphology and segmentation or CAD algorithm performance can be investigated without the need for repetitive patient exams. This database can also serve as a reference standard for device and reader performance studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to expand capabilities within the healthcare domain, particularly in the discipline of oncology. Watson For Oncology (WfO) is an AI-enabled clinical decision support system that presents potential therapeutic options for cancer-treating physicians. The objectives of this study were to identify non-user physicians' expectations, perceived challenges and benefits of WfO use in Brazil. Method(s): The study took place at Instituto do Cancer do Ceara (ICC), a Brazilian oncology hospital that implemented WfO in December 2017, but not all physicians adopted the tool. Physicians who had not used WfO (n = 5) were recruited through purposive sampling identified with the assistance of local research personnel. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Portuguese and later de-identified and transcribed into English. A thematic analysis of interview data based on grounded theory by two members of the research team with extensive experience in qualitative data analysis was conducted. Result(s): Non-user physicians had positive perceptions about WfO, along with several concerns and uncertainties. They expected that WfO would be easy to learn, useful, and helpful. Physicians perceived that WfO would provide a more standardized approach to treatment than care without it. They also believed that WfO would play a supportive and not a substitute role in care especially for complex cases in which the physicians had more in-depth knowledge of a patient and already had an established patient-provider relationship. Physicians did expect WfO use to negatively impact productivity, specifically through longer office times per patient because of the need to enter data and review recommendations. Physicians questioned whether the use of WfO would negatively impact their autonomy and role in providing care. Finally, physicians also questioned whether the treatment suggested by WfO would fit the social context of a low-middle income country such as Brazil with limited technological and economic resources. Conclusion(s): The implementation of USdeveloped AI technologies, such as WfO, should be further explored in different social and economic contexts. Physician concerns about productivity and autonomy need to be assessed and addressed in AI implementation; one strategy is to leverage previous lessons learned from electronic health record (EHR) implementations. This study is a critical step in understanding potential user perspectives in adopting a new AI tool in different social contexts.},

In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders' perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an "intelligent advertising" AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research.},

  abstract = {Background: Several studies have recently reported on the correlation between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms in patients with affective disorders (unipolar and bipolar disorders). However, individual studies have reported on different and sometimes contradicting results, and no quantitative systematic review of the correlation between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms has been published. Objective: The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) provide an overview of the correlations between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms reported in the literature and (2) investigate the strength and statistical significance of these correlations across studies. The answers to these questions could potentially help identify which objective features have shown most promising results across studies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Web of Sciences, PsychINFO, PubMed, DBLP computer science bibliography, HTA, DARE, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched and supplemented by hand examination of reference lists. The search ended on April 27, 2017, and was limited to studies published between 2007 and 2017. Results: A total of 46 studies were eligible for the review. These studies identified and investigated 85 unique objective behavioral features, covering 17 various sensor data inputs. These features were divided into 7 categories. Several features were found to have statistically significant and consistent correlation directionality with mood assessment (eg, the amount of home stay, sleep duration, and vigorous activity), while others showed directionality discrepancies across the studies (eg, amount of text messages [short message service] sent, time spent between locations, and frequency of mobile phone screen activity). Conclusions: Several studies showed consistent and statistically significant correlations between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms. Hence, continuous and everyday monitoring of behavioral aspects in affective disorders could be a promising supplementary objective measure for estimating depressive mood symptoms. However, the evidence is limited by methodological issues in individual studies and by a lack of standardization of (1) the collected objective features, (2) the mood assessment methodology, and (3) the statistical methods applied. Therefore, consistency in data collection and analysis in future studies is needed, making replication studies as well as meta-analyses possible.},

With a power of 0.95 to detect a difference larger than 0.8 points on a 5-point scale, we did not detect a significant difference in responses to six questions regarding attitudes when respondents were alternatively asked about AI versus AHI (mean difference range: 0.04-0.22 points; p {$>$} 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Although findings may be setting-specific, we observed that use of the terms "AI" and "AHI" in a survey on attitudes of clinical staff elicited similar responses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To explore attitudes about artificial intelligence (AI) among staff who utilized AI-based clinical decision support (CDS)., METHODS: A survey was designed to assess staff attitudes about AI-based CDS tools. The survey was anonymously and voluntarily completed by clinical staff in three primary care outpatient clinics before and after implementation of an AI-based CDS system aimed to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes as part of a quality improvement project. The CDS identified patients at risk for poor glycemic control and generated intervention recommendations intended to reduce patients' risk., RESULTS: Staff completed 45 surveys pre-intervention and 38 post-intervention. Following implementation, staff felt that care was better coordinated (11 favorable responses, 14 unfavorable responses pre-intervention; 21 favorable responses, 3 unfavorable responses post-intervention; p {$<$} 0.01). However, only 14 \% of users would recommend the AI-based CDS. Staff feedback revealed that the most favorable aspect of the CDS was that it promoted team dialog about patient needs (N = 14, 52 \%), and the least favorable aspect was inadequacy of the interventions recommended by the CDS., CONCLUSIONS: AI-based CDS tools that are perceived negatively by staff may reduce staff excitement about AI technology, and hands-on experience with AI may lead to more realistic expectations about the technology's capabilities. In our setting, although AI-based CDS prompted an interdisciplinary discussion about the needs of patients at high risk for poor glycemic control, the interventions recommended by the CDS were often perceived to be poorly tailored, inappropriate, or not useful. Developers should carefully consider tasks that are best performed by AI and those best performed by the patient's care team. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Like demand increases, other factors require grid infrastructure improvement, updates, and opening to other technologies that assuage the final customer needs. Precisely, the interest in renewable energy sources, the constant evolution of energy storage technologies, the continuous research involving microgrid management systems, and the evolution of cloud computing technologies and machine learning strategies motivate the development of this article. Tasks associated with a microgrid cluster like the integration of a considerable number of heterogeneous devices, real-time support, information processing, massive storage capabilities, security considerations, and advanced optimization techniques usage could take place in an autonomous and scalable energy management system architecture under a machine learning perspective running in real-time and using Cloud resources. This paper focuses on identifying the elements considered by different authors to define a cloud-based architecture and ensure the appropriately supervised learning functionality under a microgrids cluster environment. Namely, it was necessary to revise and run microgrid simulations, real-time simulation platforms usage, connection to a virtual server for microgrid control and set the energy management system using cloud computing and machine learning. Based on the review and considering the scenarios mentioned, this article presents a scalable and autonomous cloud-based architecture that allows power generation forecast, energy consumption prediction, a real-time energy management system using machine learning techniques.},

Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships. The transformation of traditional clinics into digital ones is outlined, and the challenges associated with the successful deployment of digitalization in psychiatry are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The technology at the heart of the most innovative progress in health care artificial intelligence (AI) is in a subdomain called machine learning (ML), which describes the use of software algorithms to identify patterns in very large datasets. ML has driven much of the progress of health care AI over the past 5 years, demonstrating impressive results in clinical decision support, patient monitoring and coaching, surgical assistance, patient care, and systems management. Clinicians in the near future will find themselves working with information networks on a scale well beyond the capacity of human beings to grasp, thereby necessitating the use of intelligent machines to analyze and interpret the complex interactions between data, patients, and clinical decision makers. However, as this technology becomes more powerful, it also becomes less transparent, and algorithmic decisions are therefore progressively more opaque. This is problematic because computers will increasingly be asked for answers to clinical questions that have no single right answer and that are open-ended, subjective, and value laden. As ML continues to make important contributions in a variety of clinical domains, clinicians will need to have a deeper understanding of the design, implementation, and evaluation of ML to ensure that current health care is not overly influenced by the agenda of technology entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The aim of this article is to provide a nontechnical introduction to the concept of ML in the context of health care, the challenges that arise, and the resulting implications for clinicians.},

Because of HBOC's rarity, screening is recommended only for women with strong cancer family histories. However, most patients do not have accurate history available and struggle to understand genetic concepts. Method(s): Cancer in the Family, an online clinical decision support tool, calculated women's HBOC risk and promoted shared patient-provider decisions about screening. A pilot evaluation (N = 9 providers, n = 48 patients) assessed the tool's impact on knowledge, attitudes, and screening decisions. Patients used the tool before wellness exams and completed three surveys. Providers accessed the tool during exams, completed exam checklists, and completed four surveys. Result(s): Patients entered complete family histories (67\%), calculated personal risk (96\%), and shared risk printouts with providers (65\%). HBOC knowledge increased dramatically for patients and providers, and many patients (75\%) perceived tool results as valid. The tool prompted patient-provider discussions about HBOC risk and cancer family history (88\%). Conclusion(s): The tool was effective in increasing knowledge, collecting family history, and sparking patient-provider discussions about HBOC screening. Practice implications: Interactive tools can effectively communicate personalized risk and promote shared decisions, but they are not a substitute for patient-provider discussions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Method: A broadly representative adult outpatient sample with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder received one (N=3,671) to four (N=123) successive acute treatment steps. Those not achieving remission with or unable to tolerate a treatment step were encouraged to move to the next step. Those with an acceptable benefit, preferably symptom remission, from any particular step could enter a 12-month naturalistic follow-up phase. A score of ≤5 on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report (QIDS-SR 16 ) (equivalent to ≤7 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD 17 ]) defined remission; a QIDS-SR 16 total score of ≥11 (HRSD 17 ≥14) defined relapse. Results: The QIDS-SR 16 remission rates were 36.8\%, 30.6\%, 13.7\%, and 13.0\% for the first, second, third, and fourth acute treatment steps, respectively. The overall cumulative remission rate was 67\%. Overall, those who required more treatment steps had higher relapse rates during the naturalistic follow-up phase. In addition, lower relapse rates were found among participants who were in remission at follow-up entry than for those who were not after the first three treatment steps. Conclusions: When more treatment steps are required, lower acute remission rates (especially in the third and fourth treatment steps) and higher relapse rates during the follow-up phase are to be expected. Studies to identify the best multistep treatment sequences for individual patients and the development of more broadly effective treatments are needed.},

In this commentary, we review published and potential applications for the use of ML for monitoring within the hospital environment. We present use cases as well as several questions regarding the application of ML to the analysis of the vast amount of complex data that clinicians must interpret in the realm of continuous physiological monitoring. ML, especially employed in bidirectional conjunction with electronic health record data, has the potential to extract much more useful information out of this currently under-analyzed data source from a population level. As a data driven entity, ML is dependent on copious, high quality input data so that error can be introduced by low quality data sources. At present, while ML is being studied in hybrid formulations along with static expert systems for monitoring applications, it is not yet actively incorporated in the formal artificial learning sense of an algorithm constantly learning and updating its rules without external intervention. Finally, innovations in monitoring, including those supported by ML, will pose regulatory and medico-legal challenges, as well as questions regarding precisely how to incorporate these features into clinical care and medical education. Rigorous evaluation of ML techniques compared to traditional methods or other AI methods will be required to validate the algorithms developed with consideration of database limitations and potential learning errors. Demonstration of value on processes and outcomes will be necessary to support the use of ML as a feature in monitoring system development: Future research is needed to evaluate all AI based programs before clinical implementation in non-research settings.},

Methods: The individual-level shifts in median social media usage behavior from February 1 through May 3, 2020 were summarized using repeated measures analysis of variance that accounted for the fixed effects of the lockdown (prelockdown versus postlockdown), group (clinical anxiety group versus nonclinical anxiety group), the interaction of lockdown and group, and random effects of users. A machine learning-based approach that combined a hidden Markov model and logistic regression was applied to predict clinical anxiety (n=44) and nonclinical anxiety (n=51), based on longitudinal time-series data that comprised communication and social networking app usage (in seconds) as well as anxiety-associated clinical survey variables, including the presence of an essential worker in the household, worries about life instability, changes in social interaction frequency during the lockdown, cohabitation status, and health status. Results: Individual-level analysis of daily social media usage showed that the increase in communication app usage from prelockdown to lockdown period was significantly smaller in the clinical anxiety group than that in the nonclinical anxiety group (F-1(,7)2=3.84, P=.05). The machine learning model achieved a mean accuracy of 62.30\% (SD 16\%) and area under the receiver operating curve 0.70 (SD 0.19) in 10-fold cross-validation in identifying the clinical anxiety group. Conclusions: Patients who reported severe anxiety symptoms were less active in communication apps after the mandated lockdown and more engaged in social networking apps in the overall period, which suggested that there was a different pattern of digital social behavior for adapting to the crisis. Predictive modeling using digital biomarkers-passive-sensing of shifts in category-based social media app usage during the lockdown-can identify individuals at risk for psychiatric sequelae.},

  abstract = {As life expectancy increases, there is a growing consensus on the development of integrated care encompassing the health and daily activities of older adults. In recent years, although the demand for machine learning applications in healthcare has increased, only a few studies have implemented machine learning-based systems in integrated care for older adults owing to the complex needs of older adults and the coarseness of the available data. Our study aims to explore the possibility of implementing machine learning decision-support algorithms in the integrated care of older community-dwelling adults. Our experiment uses secondary data based on the community-based integrated service model. Such data were collected from 511 older adults through 162 assessment items in which tailored services were selected from 18 available services. We implemented four machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and multilayer perceptron. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve results of the four models were decision tree = 0.89, K-nearest neighbors = 0.88, random forest = 0.93, and multilayer perceptron = 0.88. The results suggest that machine learning-based decision-assisting algorithms can improve the quality of tailored services for integrated care with intensive involvement of face-to-face tasks by reducing the simple, repetitive tasks of care managers.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  abstract = {Purpose of review: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are tools, ideally embedded within electronic health systems, that can facilitate clinicians utilizing best practices and individual patient data to improve outcomes. While various iterations of CDSS have existed for years (including on paper-based charting systems), the past decade has seen an explosion of these systems. This review highlights some recent trends in CDSS, including where improvement in patient outcomes was achieved, as well as areas where the benefits were not realized. Recent findings: Overall, three categories of CDSS improving patient safety have been analyzed. These include reduction in adverse events relating to medications, helping facilitate antimicrobial stewardship, and the identification and treatment of pediatric sepsis. In each of these areas, CDSS has been generally shown to improve patient safety to varying degrees. Occasional studies have shown no improvement or worsening outcomes, although this is often due to poor training of clinicians with the technology rather than a flaw with the technology itself. Most CDSS research has been unable to show improvements in tangible outcomes such as mortality rates, but this is often secondary to the fact that these outcomes are rare in the pediatric context and thus showing improvements is challenging. Summary: CDSS is a simple term to describe a heterogenous group of interventions, designed to improve patient care using technology. In this review, the evidence shows that it can improve adherence to antimicrobial guidelines, minimize medication errors, and improve identification of pediatric sepsis. Like any new system, when implemented cautiously, with ample time for education of staff and troubleshooting, it can improve patient safety; however, if not implemented with sufficient forethought, it may not improve safety and can indeed cause its own adverse events.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {In classification, noise may deteriorate the system performance and increase the complexity of the models built. In order to mitigate its consequences, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. Among them, noise filtering, which removes noisy examples from the training data, is one of the most used techniques. This paper proposes a new noise filtering method that combines several filtering strategies in order to increase the accuracy of the classification algorithms used after the filtering process. The filtering is based on the fusion of the predictions of several classifiers used to detect the presence of noise. We translate the idea behind multiple classifier systems, where the information gathered from different models is combined, to noise filtering. In this way, we consider the combination of classifiers instead of using only one to detect noise. Additionally, the proposed method follows an iterative noise filtering scheme that allows us to avoid the usage of detected noisy examples in each new iteration of the filtering process. Finally, we introduce a noisy score to control the filtering sensitivity, in such a way that the amount of noisy examples removed in each iteration can be adapted to the necessities of the practitioner. The first two strategies (use of multiple classifiers and iterative filtering) are used to improve the filtering accuracy, whereas the last one (the noisy score) controls the level of conservation of the filter removing potentially noisy examples. The validity of the proposed method is studied in an exhaustive experimental study. We compare the new filtering method against several state-of-the-art methods to deal with datasets with class noise and study their efficacy in three classifiers with different sensitivity to noise.

  abstract = {The increasing usage of machine-learning models in critical domains has recently stressed the necessity of interpretable machine-learning models. In areas like healthcare, finary - the model consumer must understand the rationale behind the model output in order to use it when making a decision. For this reason, it is impossible to use black-box models in these scenarios, regardless of their high predictive performance. Decision forests, and in particular Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), are examples of this kind of model. GBDT models are considered the state-of-the-art in many classification challenges, reflected by the fact that the majority of Kaggle's recent winners used GBDT methods as a part of their solution (such as XGBoost). But despite their superior predictive perfor-mance, they cannot be used in tasks that require transparency. This paper presents a novel method for transforming a decision forest of any kind into an interpretable decision tree. The method extends the tool-set available for machine learning practitioners, who want to exploit the interpretability of decision trees without significantly impairing the predic-tive performance gained by GBDT models like XGBoost. We show in an empirical evalua-tion that in some cases the generated tree is able to approximate the predictive performance of a XGBoost model while enabling better transparency of the outputs.

The survey included house officers, post-graduate trainees, and general dental practitioner and specialist consultant dental surgeons of either gender. A questionnaire was adopted from an existing similar study and modifications were made according to our settings. The link of survey was created using Google Docs and disseminated through various open social media groups of dental practitioner in Karachi. Result(s): Total 118 complete responses were received with almost equal responses from males (n=56, 47.5\%) and females (n=52.5\%). The mean age of study participants was 30.3+/-5.9 years. 83(70.3\%) had awareness of the artificial intelligence driven tools in dentistry. 75.9\%, 77.1\%, 10.8\%, 28.9\%, 39.8\%, 2.4\% and 10.8\% reported the use of digital intraoral radiographs, CAD-CAM, CBCT, digital dental records, clinical decision support system and none of the tool in their practice respectively. All of the participants had opinion that AI applications should be part of dental trainings. Conclusion(s): The present survey showed that the majority had awareness of AI applications in dentistry and had positive perception regarding its future role but there was lacking in the utilization rate of AI tools in their practice. Therefore, it is recommended to attend AI trainings to bring and adapt the AI related changes in local settings.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College. All rights reserved.},

Accurate prediction of outcomes is needed to help select a treatment that is likely to work for a given person. We aim to examine the performance of machine learning methods in delivering replicable predictions of treatment outcomes. Methods. Of 7732 non-duplicate records identified through literature search, we retained 59 eligible reports and extracted data on sample, treatment, predictors, machine learning method, and treatment outcome prediction. A minimum sample size of 100 and an adequate validation method were used to identify adequate-quality studies. The effects of study features on prediction accuracy were tested with mixed-effects models. Fifty-four of the studies provided accuracy estimates or other estimates that allowed calculation of balanced accuracy of predicting outcomes of treatment. Results. Eight adequate-quality studies reported a mean accuracy of 0.63 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.71], which was significantly lower than a mean accuracy of 0.75 (95\% CI 0.72–0.78) in the other 46 studies. Among the adequate-quality studies, accuracies were higher when predicting treatment resistance (0.69) and lower when predicting remission (0.60) or response (0.56). The choice of machine learning method, feature selection, and the ratio of features to individuals were not associated with reported accuracy. Conclusions. The negative relationship between study quality and prediction accuracy, combined with a lack of independent replication, invites caution when evaluating the potential of machine learning applications for personalizing the treatment of depression.},

One of the main ED priorities is to quickly identify those who will need hospital admission. This study evaluates the performance of a simple logistic model on its ability to predict whether a patient visiting the ED will subsequently be admitted to the hospital or not, based on initial ED patients' data retrieved from the Biochemistry and Hematology Laboratories. Our aim is to find an algorithm using ML techniques to assist clinical decision-making in the emergency setting. Method(s): A total of 3,204 ED visits were analyzed during the study period (14 March-4 May 2019). The anonymous data set under investigation contained the following variables: serum levels of urea, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, complete blood count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-Dimer, International Normalized Ratio, age, gender, triage disposition to ED unit, ambulance utilization and admission to hospital. All raw data was retrieved from a standard Hospital Information System (HIS) and a Laboratory Information System (LIS). The analysis was performed using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. In our analysis we evaluated the simple logistic classifier for building linear logistic regression model [1] using the LogitBoost algorithm. Result(s): The simple logistic classifier weighted average results achieved an F-measure of 0.696, a precision value of 0.703, a recall value of 0.712 and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) of 0.755. Conclusion(s): We present an inexpensive clinical decision support tool derived from readily available ED patient data. This tool intends to aid the emergency physician regarding hospital admission decisions, as the development of machine learning models represents a rapidly evolving field in healthcare.},

While elements of this approach are typically used to guide the development of information systems that instantiate a significant user interface, it appears to be rare for the entire process to be implemented. In fact, a number of authors have put forth development lifecycle models that are subsets of the classical systems engineering method, but fail to include steps such as incremental hazard analysis and post-deployment corrective and preventative actions. In that most health information systems have safety implications, we argue that the design and development of such systems would benefit by implementing this systems engineering approach in full. Particularly with regard to bringing a human-centered perspective to the formulation of system requirements and the configuration of effective user interfaces, this classical systems engineering method provides an excellent framework for incorporating human factors (ergonomics) knowledge and integrating ergonomists in the interdisciplinary development of health information systems.},

Method(s): Artificial intelligence comprises various subfields that present potential solutions to identify patterns of SSI data. Discussions on opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these methods to derive accurate SSI prediction are provided. Result(s): Four main challenges in dealing with SSI data were defined: (1) complexities in using SSI data, (2) disease knowledge, (3) decision support, and (4) heterogeneity. The implications of some of the recent advances in AI methods to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed.

  abstract = {Arden Syntax is a widely recognized standard for representing clinical and scientific knowledge in an executable format. It has a history that reaches back until 1989 and is currently maintained by the Health Level 7 (HL7) organization. We created a production-ready development environment, compiler, rule engine and application server for Arden Syntax. Over the course of several years, we have applied this Arden - Syntax - based CDS system in a wide variety of clinical problem domains, such as hepatitis serology interpretation, monitoring of nosocomial infections or the prediction of metastatic events in melanoma patients. We found the Arden Syntax standard to be very suitable for the practical implementation of CDS systems. Among the advantages of Arden Syntax are its status as an actively developed HL7 standard, the readability of the syntax, and various syntactic features such as flexible list handling. A major challenge we encountered was the technical integration of our CDS systems in existing, heterogeneous health information systems. To address this issue, we are currently working on incorporating the HL7 standard GELLO, which provides a standardized interface and query language for accessing data in health information systems. We hope that these planned extensions of the Arden Syntax might eventually help in realizing the vision of a global, interoperable and shared library of clinical decision support knowledge.

  abstract = {BackgroundVery few of the publicly available apps directed towards self-management of low back pain (LBP) have been rigorously tested and their theoretical underpinnings seldom described. The selfBACK app was developed in collaboration with end-users and clinicians and its content is supported by best evidence on self-management of LBP. The objectives of this pilot study were to investigate the basis for recruitment and screening procedures for the subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT), to test the inclusion process in relation to questionnaires and app installation, and finally to investigate the change in primary outcome over time.MethodsThis single-armed pilot study enrolled 51 participants who had sought help for LBP of any duration from primary care (physiotherapy, chiropractic, or general practice) within the past 8weeks. Participants were screened for eligibility using the PROMIS-Physical-Function-4a questionnaire. Participants were asked to use the selfBACK app for 6weeks. The app provided weekly tailored self-management plans targeting physical activity, strength and flexibility exercises, and education. The construction of the self-management plans was achieved using case-based reasoning (CBR) methodology to capture and reuse information from previous successful cases. Participants completed the primary outcome pain-related disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ]) at baseline and 6-week follow-up along with a range of secondary outcomes. Metrics of app use were collected throughout the intervention period.ResultsFollow-up data at 6weeks was obtained for 43 participants. The recruitment procedures were feasible, and the number needed to screen was acceptable (i.e., 1.6:1). The screening questionnaire was altered during the pilot study. The inclusion process, answering questionnaires and app installation, were feasible. The primary outcome (RMDQ) improved from 8.6 (SD 5.1) at baseline to 5.9 (SD 4.0) at 6-week follow-up (change score 1.8, 95\% CI 0.7 to 2.9). Participants spent on average 134min (range 0-889min) using the app during the 6-week period.ConclusionThe recruitment, screening, and inclusion procedures were feasible for the subsequent RCT with a small adjustment. The improvement on the RMDQ from baseline to follow-up was small. Time pattern of app usage varied considerably between the participants.Trial registrationNCT03697759.

  abstract = {The study presents a new ANN-based approach to determine the density of a liquid applied in the gamma transmission and gamma scattering techniques. This approach used the Monte Carlo simulation combined with an artificial intelligence technique and experimental data to estimate the density of liquids. Two advantages of the proposed approach: (1) it is able to determine the density of a liquid by only measuring the gamma spectrum (transmission spectrum or scattering spectrum) without knowing the composition of the liquid, and (2) it is able to determine the density of a liquid when it is contained in a tube of various diameters. The artificial neural network model was trained by data obtained from simulation and then was used to predict the density of seven liquids with density in the range of 0.6 g cm(-3) to 2.0 g cm(-3) for the purpose of validating the proposed approach. For the gamma transmission technique, there are 25/28 samples with relative deviations between reference and predicted densities of less than 5\%. The remaining three samples have deviations in the range from 5.2\% to 6.3\%. For the gamma scattering technique, there are 17/21 samples with a relative deviation of less than 5\%. The remaining four samples have a deviation in the range from 5.2\% to 6.9\%. The results proved that the artificial intelligence technique combined with Monte Carlo based on gamma transmission and gamma scattering techniques is an effective approach for estimating the density of a liquid.},

  abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER) status evaluation is a widely applied method in the prognosis of breast cancer. However, testing for the existence of the ER biomarker in a patient's tumor sample mainly depends on the subjective decisions of the doctors. The aim of this paper is to introduce the usage of a machine learning tool, functional trees (FTs), to attain an ER prognosis of the disease via an objective decision model. For this aim, 27 image files, each of which came from a biopsy sample of an invasive ductal carcinoma patient, were scanned and captured by a light microscope. From these images, 5150 nuclei were segmented with image processing methods. Several attributes, including statistical, wavelet, cooccurrence matrix, and Laws' texture features, were calculated inside the border area of each nucleus. A FT was trained over the feature dataset using a 10-fold cross-validation and then the obtained model was tested on a separate dataset. The assessment results of the model were compared with those of 2 experts. Consequently, the weighted kappa coefficient indicated a very good agreement (kappa = 0.899 and kappa = 0.927, P {$<$} 0.001) and the Spearman's rank order correlation showed a high level of correlation (rho = 0.963 and rho = 0.943, P {$<$} 0.001) between the results of the FT and those of the observers. The Wilcoxon test revealed that there was no significant difference between the results of the experts and the model (P = 0.051 and P = 0.316). Finally, it was concluded from the results that the FT could be used as a tool to support the decision of doctors by indicating consistent outputs and hence contribute to the objectiveness and reproducibility of the assessment results.},

Current knowledge suggests that mental health disorders may reflect deviant trajectories of brain maturation. Method We studied 654 children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans under a resting-state protocol. A machine-learning method was used to obtain age predictions of children based on the average coefficient of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) of the DMN, a measure of spontaneous local activity. The chronological ages of the children and fALFF measures from regions of this network, the response and predictor variables were considered respectively in a Gaussian Process Regression. Subsequently, we computed a network maturation status index for each subject (actual age minus predicted). We then evaluated the association between this maturation index and psychopathology scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results Our hypothesis was that the maturation status of the DMN would be negatively associated with psychopathology. Consistent with previous studies, fALFF significantly predicted the age of participants (p {$<$} .001). Furthermore, as expected, we found an association between the DMN maturation status (precocious vs. delayed) and general psychopathology scores (p = .011). Conclusions Our findings suggest that child psychopathology seems to be associated with delayed maturation of the DMN. This delay in the neurodevelopmental trajectory may offer interesting insights into the pathophysiology of mental health disorders.},

Many of these disorders affect brain development and its connectivity.In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing brain networks based on the combination of a graph theory measure (eigenvector centrality) and a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM).Methods: We applied this approach to resting-state fMRI data from 622 children and adolescents. Eigenvector centrality (EVC) of nodes from positive- and negative-task networks were extracted from each subject and used as input to an OC-SVM to label individual brain networks as typical or atypical. We hypothesised that classification of these subjects regarding the pattern of brain connectivity would predict the level of psychopathology.Results: Subjects with atypical brain network organisation had higher levels of psychopathology (p {$<$} 0.001). There was a greater EVC in the typical group at the bilateral posterior cingulate and bilateral posterior temporal cortices; and significant decreases in EVC at left temporal pole.Conclusions: The combination of graph theory methods and an OC-SVM is a promising method to characterise neurodevelopment, and may be useful to understand the deviations leading to mental disorders.},

However, its stocks have dramatically declined due, inter alia, to excessive logging, insufficient natural regeneration and a slow recovery rate. Thus, there is a need to promote enrichment planting and develop effective technique to support its rehabilitation and improve timber production through implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genomic Selection (GS). To assist such efforts, plant materials were collected from a half-sib progeny population in Sari Bumi Kusuma forest concession, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using 5900 markers in sequences obtained from 356 individuals, we detected high linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending up to {$>$}145 kb, suggesting that associations between phenotypic traits and markers in LD can be more easily and feasibly detected with GWAS than with analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the detection power of GWAS seems low, since few single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any focal traits were detected with a stringent false discovery rate, indicating that the species' phenotypic traits are mostly under polygenic quantitative control. Furthermore, Machine Learning provided higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods. We also found that stem diameter, branch diameter ratio and wood density were more predictable than height, clear bole, branch angle and wood stiffness traits. Our study suggests that GS has potential for improving the productivity and quality of S. platyclados, and our genomic heritability estimates may improve the selection of traits to target in future breeding of this species.},

Eight criteria were used to evaluate the appropriateness of these databases for older person prehospital trauma triage decision-rule development., FINDINGS: Only 4 of the 33 states funded for CODES database development released their data to the study team during the 13-month data-acquisition period. Potential predictor variables (of life-threatening injury) and outcome variables (need for trauma center care) were identified for each database. Several databases had large amounts of missing data. Codebooks were available but descriptions of data validation procedures were unavailable., CONCLUSIONS: At this time, limited access to and development of CODES databases and missing data preclude the usefulness of these databases for older person triage decision rule development. Although adequate funding must be appropriated for continued CODES development, and commitment from individual states is essential, these databases offer great promise as a mechanism for decision-rule development to guide triage decision-making. Investigators should systematically evaluate large databases before using them in secondary analyses for clinical decision rule development., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nurses participate in the planning, development, and implementation of health information systems in various settings. They also assume important roles in prehospital care as direct care providers, EMS administrators, participants of local and state EMS councils where emergency care problems are discussed and policies are formulated, and through use at state and federal levels.},

We use fixed weights from a convolutional deep neural network trained on ImageNet to generate deep embeddings from each image and train machine learning models to detect morphological disease phenotypes. Our platform's robustness and sensitivity allow the detection of individual-specific variation with high fidelity across batches and plate layouts. Lastly, our models confidently separate LRRK2 and sporadic Parkinson's disease lines from healthy controls (receiver operating characteristic area under curve 0.79 (0.08 standard deviation)), supporting the capacity of this platform for complex disease modeling and drug screening applications.

  abstract = {There is compelling evidence that recent advances in computer science will play a vital role in future medicine assisting diagnosis and treatment (Rahmesh AN 2004). Decision support systems are already in routine use in hospitals for selecting most appropriate imaging methods and imaging protocols according to the latest international guidelines. Computer science has important potential to facilitate and analyse US, CT and MRI images in oncology e.g. automated cancer detection, segmentation and characterization as well as quantitative therapy response assessment. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including e.g. neuronal networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, deep learning or computer vision are currently emerging. Radiomics refers to sophisticated computer algorithms that extract numerous quantitative imaging features (mostly from ROIs preselected by radiologists). Various applications are currently emerging including e.g. automated detection and characterization of lung, breast and prostate cancer. Novel healthcare informatics and communication technology open amazing opportunities for improving cancer imaging. With the increasing demand for cancer imaging, ever greater demand for expert knowledge in oncologic radiology is developing. But oncologic imaging specialists are usually located only in larger hospitals and dedicated care cancer centers, which, in turn, are located only in larger metropolitan areas. As a consequence, staffing shortage in rural, lowresource and less-educated areas will be inevitable. For a hospital administration it may even be easier to purchase high-performance imaging devices than to recruit imaging specialists. Accordingly, actual imaging opportunities may lie dormant. Support of imaging decisions for best possible utilization of local radiologic capabilities is feasible using the novel communication technology (DiPiro PJ 2017). Oncologic radiologists are in particular familiar with the situation that imaging studies acquired at other institutions are transmitted to their centers for second-opinion reporting and follow-up assessment. An extended radiology consulting service can accordingly include recommendation and implementation of state-of-the-art imaging protocols, quality control, image interpretation and documentation of the imaging studies according to most recent guidelines. Even clinical decision support by participation in interdisciplinary tumor boards sessions is on principle possible from a technological point of view. The growth of the internet with broad band capabilities has made teleradiology already a daily experience for many radiologists. National telemedicine programmes are currently under development in order to share expertise for improved cross-border medical services (Saliba V 2012). For the time being, however, major obstacles still hinder this progress including (1) legal aspects including data privacy, (2) financing, (3) local infrastructure and resources and (4) cultural factors (Saliba V 2012). Cross-border telemedicine combined with AI may have significant impact on improved care of cancer patients, particularly in rural areas and developing countries where expert knowledge is not available. Exploiting the opportunities of AI, consulting oncologic radiologists may act as remote 'information specialists' providing access to a specialist service (Jha S 2016). Current research on AI is emerging considerably, and further advancements in healthcare informatics and the built-up of supra-regional networks will help to overcome barriers. Novel IT technologies open the window to improving cancer imaging and making a high-quality imaging service available for more patients.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Allgemeines Krankenhaus Informations Management (AKIM) project was started at the Vienna General Hospital (VGH) several years ago. This led to the introduction of a new hospital information system (HIS), and the installation of the expert system platform (EXP) for the integration of Arden-Syntax-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). In this report we take a look at the milestones achieved and the challenges faced in the creation and modification of CDSSs, and their integration into the HIS over the last three years., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a three-stage development method, which is followed in nearly all CDSS projects at the Medical University of Vienna and the VGH. Stage one comprises requirements engineering and system conception. Stage two focuses on the implementation and testing of the system. Finally, stage three describes the deployment and integration of the system in the VGH HIS. The HIS provides a clinical work environment for healthcare specialists using customizable graphical interfaces known as parametric medical documents. Multiple Arden Syntax servers are employed to host and execute the CDSS knowledge bases: two embedded in the EXP for production and development, and a further three in clinical routine for production, development, and quality assurance., RESULTS: Three systems are discussed; the systems serve different purposes in different clinical areas, but are all implemented with Arden Syntax. MONI-ICU is an automated surveillance system for monitoring healthcare-associated infections in the intensive care setting. TSM-CDS is a CDSS used for risk prediction in the formation of cutaneous melanoma metastases. Finally, TacroDS is a CDSS for the manipulation of dosages for tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive agent used after kidney transplantation. Problems in development and integration were related to data quality or availability, although organizational difficulties also caused delays in development and integration., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Since the inception of the AKIM project at the VGH and its ability to support standards such as Arden Syntax and integrate CDSSs into clinical routine, the clinicians' interest in, and demand for, decision support has increased substantially. The use of Arden Syntax as a standard for CDSSs played a substantial role in the ability to rapidly create high-quality CDSS systems, whereas the ability to integrate these systems into the HIS made CDSSs more popular among physicians. Despite these successes, challenges such as lack of (consistent and high-quality) electronic data, social acceptance among healthcare personnel, and legislative issues remain. These have to be addressed effectively before CDSSs can be more widely accepted and adopted. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Method(s): Distinguishing the concepts of health literacy and patient empowerment, we analyze conditions that bias patient use of the Internet and limit access to and impact of artificial intelligence. Result(s): Improving health literacy in the face of the Internet requires significant guidance. Patients must be directed toward the appropriate tools and also provided with key background knowledge enabling them to use the tools and capitalize on the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusion(s): Benefits of tools employing artificial intelligence to promote health cannot be realized without recognizing and addressing the patients' desires, expectations, and limitations that impact their Internet behavior. In order to benefit from artificial intelligence, patients need a substantial level of background knowledge and skill in information use-i.e., health literacy.

  abstract = {Background and Aims Previous research indicates that motivational interviewing (MI) skills decline over time among participants in training workshops when post-workshop feedback and coaching are not provided. This study explored moderators of skill retention among trainees learning MI mainly for substance use disorder treatment in real-world treatment settings, including workshop enhancements and type and dose of post-workshop feedback and coaching. Methods A meta-analysis of training studies was conducted with studies that reported MI skills using observational measures and that included trainees from real-world agency settings. Standardized change scores were calculated to indicate the magnitude of pre–post training change in MI skills; standardized change scores from post-training to 3 and 6+ months follow-up were calculated to indicate the sustainability of training gains over time. Effect sizes were aggregated using random effects models. Results Twenty-one papers that reported the effects of MI training on agency staff were included in this review. Across studies, training yielded gains in MI skills (d = 0.76). Studies that did not include feedback and/or coaching reported eroding skills over a 6-month follow-up (d = −0.30), whereas post-workshop feedback/coaching sustained skills (d = 0.03). Effects of post-workshop feedback/coaching were moderated by frequency, duration and length of training. Moreover, studies reporting low levels of attrition from training protocols showed small increases in skills over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.12), whereas studies with high attrition showed skill erosion (d = −0.29). Conclusions On average, three to four feedback/coaching sessions over a 6-month period sustain skills among trainees for motivational interviewing, mainly for substance use disorder treatment. However, high rates of attrition from feedback/coaching contributes to post-workshop skill erosion.},

Methods: A disorder-heterogeneous, naturalistic sample of N = 1,379 outpatients treated with either cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy was analyzed. Based on a combination of random forest and linear regression, differential treatment response was modeled in the training data (n = 966) to indicate each individual’s optimal treatment. A separate holdout dataset (n = 413) was used to evaluate personalized recommendations. Results: The difference in outcomes between patients treated with their optimal vs. non-optimal treatment was significant in the training data, but non-significant in the holdout data (b = –0.043, p = .280). However, for the 50\% of patients with the largest predicted benefit of receiving their optimal treatment, the average percentage of change on the BSI in the holdout data was 52.6\% for their optimal and 38.4\% for their non-optimal treatment (p = .017; d = 0.33 [0.06, 0.61]). Conclusion: A treatment selection algorithm based on a combination of ML and statistical inference might improve treatment outcome for some, but not all outpatients and could support therapists’ clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study sought to describe the prevalence and nature of clinical expert involvement in the development, evaluation, and implementation of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that utilize machine learning to analyze electronic health record data to assist nurses and physicians in prognostic and treatment decision making (ie, predictive CDSSs) in the hospital., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore and hand-searching of relevant conference proceedings were conducted to identify eligible articles. Empirical studies of predictive CDSSs using electronic health record data for nurses or physicians in the hospital setting published in the last 5 years in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings were eligible for synthesis. Data from eligible studies regarding clinician involvement, stage in system design, predictive CDSS intention, and target clinician were charted and summarized., RESULTS: Eighty studies met eligibility criteria. Clinical expert involvement was most prevalent at the beginning and late stages of system design. Most articles (95\%) described developing and evaluating machine learning models, 28\% of which described involving clinical experts, with nearly half functioning to verify the clinical correctness or relevance of the model (47\%)., DISCUSSION: Involvement of clinical experts in predictive CDSS design should be explicitly reported in publications and evaluated for the potential to overcome predictive CDSS adoption challenges., CONCLUSIONS: If present, clinical expert involvement is most prevalent when predictive CDSS specifications are made or when system implementations are evaluated. However, clinical experts are less prevalent in developmental stages to verify clinical correctness, select model features, preprocess data, or serve as a gold standard.

This book: Applied Interdisciplinary Theory in Health Informatics: A Knowledge Base for Practitioners, explores the theories that have been applied in health informatics and the differences they have made. The editors, all proponents of evidence-based health informatics, came together within the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group on Health IT Evaluation and the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development. The purpose of the book, which has a foreword by Charles Friedman, is to move forward the agenda of evidence-based health informatics by emphasizing theory-informed work aimed at enriching the understanding of this uniquely complex field. The book takes the AMIA definition as particularly helpful in its articulation of the three foundational domains of health informatics: health science, information science, and social science and their various overlaps, and this model has been used to structure the content of the book around the major subject areas. The book discusses some of the most important and commonly used theories relevant to health informatics, and constitutes a first iteration of a consolidated knowledge base that will advance the science of the field.},

  abstract = {AIM: To examine the feasibility of using automated lexical analysis in conjunction with machine learning to create a means of objectively characterising radiology reports for quality improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve lexical parameters were quantified from the collected reports of four radiologists. These included the number of different words used, number of sentences, reading grade, readability, usage of the passive voice, and lexical metrics of concreteness, ambivalence, complexity, passivity, embellishment, communication and cognition. Each radiologist was statistically compared to the mean of the group for each parameter to determine outlying report characteristics. The reproducibility of these parameters in a given radiologist's reporting style was tested by using only these 12 parameters as input to a neural network designed to establish the authorship of 60 unknown reports. RESULTS: Significant differences in report characteristics were observed between radiologists, quantifying and characterising deviations of individuals from the group reporting style. The 12 metrics employed in a neural network correctly identified the author in each of 60 unknown reports tested, indicating a robust parametric signature. CONCLUSION: Automated and quantifiable methods can be used to analyse reporting style and provide impartial and objective feedback as well as to detect and characterise significant differences from the group. The parameters examined are sufficiently specific to identify the authors of reports and can potentially be useful in quality improvement and residency training.

  abstract = {Information systems have been popularized in all areas of our lives, and today information systems literacy has also been formed as a concept. With the pandemic, this concept has become more important, especially for physicians. At the same time, information systems, decision support systems in medicine, and evidence-based medicine approaches have become supported and work is continuing rapidly. Therefore, it is inevitable that physicians will be aware of current developments in this field. The aim of this study is to determine the literacy of information systems of physicians working in the academic field but to demonstrate the sensitivity of DSS and evidence-based medicine with a machine learning approach. The dataset was obtained from the physicians working in the academic field in Turkey. By using web-based survey, all the information including some demographic attributes, the usage level of the DDS and EBM systems, and the score of ISL belonging to 810 physicians has been recruited from this survey. A comprehensive analysis process including both statistical significance tests and machine learning algorithms was conducted to determine the group differences about the ISL scale and classify the experienced and inexperienced people on the usage of DDS and EBM systems. The range F1-score for each machine learning algorithm was satisfying (F1(DDS) = .818 to .992, F1(EBM) = .797 to .955). From the view of both training and testing performance for DDS, random forest algorithm provided the best results than its competitors. In the examination of EBM usage, while C5.0 was found better in terms of training results, extreme gradient boosting machine with linear kernel has the highest F1-score on testing performance. In the study, the ISL scale was applied to physicians working in medical schools and its effectiveness was showed to a great extent. Statistical significance test results were obtained for the title, graduation institution, specialty institution and specialty type characteristics of the physicians. However, we associated DSS, EBM and system and application approaches with the scope of both aforementioned attributes and the ISL scale. We conducted a comprehensive comparative study by using various machine learning algorithms on the subject to the study and obtained useful insight about the factors on the usage level of DDS and EBM systems. It is expected that the results will be a guide for all physicians and administrators working in the academic field.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations have a significant impact on patients with COPD by accelerating the decline in lung function leading to decreased health-related quality of life and survival time. In telehealth, health care professionals exercise clinical judgment over a physical distance. Telehealth has been implemented as a way to monitor patients more closely in daily life with an intention to intervene earlier when physical measurements indicate that health deteriorates. Several studies call for research investigating the ability of telehealth to automatically flag risk of exacerbations by applying the physical measurements that are collected as part of the monitoring routines to support health care professionals. However, more research is needed to further develop, test, and validate prediction algorithms to ensure that these algorithms improve outcomes before they are widely implemented in practice., METHOD: This trial tests a COPD prediction algorithm that is integrated into an existing telehealth system, which has been developed from the previous Danish large-scale trial, TeleCare North (NCT: 01984840). The COPD prediction algorithm aims to support clinical decisions by predicting the risk of exacerbations for patients with COPD based on selected physiological parameters. A prospective, parallel two-armed randomized controlled trial with approximately 200 participants with COPD will be conducted. The participants live in Aalborg municipality, which is located in the North Denmark Region. All participants are familiar with the telehealth system in advance. In addition to the participants' usual weekly monitored measurements, they are asked to measure their oxygen saturation two more times a week during the trial period. The primary outcome is the number of exacerbations defined as an acute hospitalization from baseline to follow-up. Secondary outcomes include changes in health-related quality of life measured by both the 12-Item Short Form Survey version 2 and EuroQol-5 Dimension Questionnaire as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio., DISCUSSION: This trial seeks to explore whether the COPD prediction algorithm has the potential to support early detection of exacerbations in a telehealth setting. The COPD prediction algorithm may initiate timely treatment, which may decrease the number of hospitalizations., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05218525 (pending at clinicaltrials.gov ) (date, month, year).

  abstract = {Purpose This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural entrepreneurship (AE) and new technologies using academic and practitioners' perspectives to understand how new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and augmented reality can promote agri-businesses. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a content and thematic analysis of 325 academic sources extracted from the Scopus database and 683 patents retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) dataset. Additionally, the research applies the Kruskal-Wallis test as a non-parametric test for evaluating differences in the main concepts discussed in the two sources. Findings The academic and practitioners' debate highlights a trading zone among the two streams. patents' analysis from the EPO reveals four main common themes as a new business that benefits from AI in weather predictions, new smart and intelligent ways to monitor crops, new businesses that use clouds to control plant's humidity. The analysis of Scopus's sources demonstrates theoretical approaches related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and practical strategies in terms of entrepreneurial skills to support the agricultural sector. However, barriers among the two streams of sources exist in innovation management and scale-up entrepreneurial initiatives. Research limitations/implications Regarding implications, the authors aim to connect academic and practitioners' views by understanding the new potential innovation applications and the connected new research avenues. Limitations might arise from the sources used to develop our analysis. Originality/value The paper is novel because it investigates the issues arising from the relationship between AE and new technologies by examining original validated patents released by practitioners and approved by the EPO, rather than reviewing blogs or the financial press. This leads to a holistic understanding of the impact of tangible practices among agricultural entrepreneurs. The results support the view that new trading zones and case studies are needed to highlight and show the positive impact of technologies in this field. The authors argue that practitioners require scholars to reduce the ambiguity between AE and its expected results, leading to investments to boost new agricultural business ideas.},

  abstract = {Background: Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7\%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. Objective: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. Methods: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. Results: The general practitioners considered that 79.60\% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96\% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77\%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30\%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23\%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question "Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95\% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60\% of the time, 701/1217). Conclusions: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55\% (79\% x 65\%) to 79\% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84\% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage. The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are being developed to assist physicians in processing extensive data and new knowledge based on recent scientific advances. Structured medical knowledge in the form of clinical alerts or reminder rules, decision trees or tables, clinical protocols or practice guidelines, score algorithms, and others, constitute the core of CDSSs. Several medical knowledge representation and guideline languages have been developed for the formal computerized definition of such knowledge. One of these languages is Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems, an International Health Level Seven (HL7) standard whose development started in 1989. Its latest version is 2.10, which was presented in 2014. In the present report we discuss Arden Syntax as a modern medical knowledge representation and processing language, and show that this language is not only well suited to define clinical alerts, reminders, and recommendations, but can also be used to implement and process computerized medical practice guidelines., METHODS: This section describes how contemporary software such as Java, server software, web-services, XML, is used to implement CDSSs based on Arden Syntax. Special emphasis is given to clinical decision support (CDS) that employs practice guidelines as its clinical knowledge base., RESULTS: Two guideline-based applications using Arden Syntax for medical knowledge representation and processing were developed. The first is a software platform for implementing practice guidelines from dermatology. This application employs fuzzy set theory and logic to represent linguistic and propositional uncertainty in medical data, knowledge, and conclusions. The second application implements a reminder system based on clinically published standard operating procedures in obstetrics to prevent deviations from state-of-the-art care. A to-do list with necessary actions specifically tailored to the gestational week/labor/delivery is generated., DISCUSSION: Today, with the latest versions of Arden Syntax and the application of contemporary software development methods, Arden Syntax has become a powerful and versatile medical knowledge representation and processing language, well suited to implement a large range of CDSSs, including clinical-practice-guideline-based CDSSs. Moreover, such CDS is provided and can be shared as a service by different medical institutions, redefining the sharing of medical knowledge. Arden Syntax is also highly flexible and provides developers the freedom to use up-to-date software design and programming patterns for external patient data access. Copyright © 2016.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of digital health is evolving rapidly with applications relevant to the prediction, detection and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). This review will summarize recent publications in these areas. RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied predominantly for AKI prediction, but also to identify patients with AKI at higher risk of adverse outcomes, and to discriminate different subgroups (subphenotypes) of AKI. There have been multiple publications in this area, but a smaller number of ML models have robust external validation or the ability to run in real-time in clinical systems. Recent studies of AKI alerting systems and clinical decision support systems continue to demonstrate variable results, which is likely to result from differences in local context and implementation strategies. In the design of AKI alerting systems, choice of baseline creatinine has a strong effect on performance of AKI detection algorithms. SUMMARY: Further research is required to overcome barriers to the validation and implementation of ML models for AKI care. Simpler electronic systems within the electronic medical record can lead to improved care in some but not all settings, and careful consideration of local context and implementation strategy is recommended.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

New conference venues and academic journals have emerged to promote the proliferating research; however, the translational path remains unclear. This review undertakes the first in-depth study to identify how machine learning models that ingest structured electronic health record data can be applied to clinical decision support tasks and translated into clinical practice. The authors complement their own work with the experience of 21 machine learning products that address problems across clinical domains and across geographic populations. Four phases of translation emerge: design and develop, evaluate and validate, diffuse and scale, and continuing monitoring and maintenance. The review highlights the varying approaches taken across each phase by teams building machine learning products and presents a discussion of challenges and opportunities. The translational path and associated findings are instructive to researchers and developers building machine learning products, policy makers regulating machine learning products, and health system leaders who are considering adopting a machine learning product.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of surgical outcomes is highly desirable to optimize surgical decision-making. An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction., METHODS: A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017., RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5\% and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15\% and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts., CONCLUSIONS: In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions. However, future studies should investigate how ML can be implemented as a practical tool supporting neurosurgical care. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Context information contains any information about an individual, object, place or time. Context is information about demographics, diseases, medication, allergy and so on. This contextual information captured using RFID can be saved in different places, like patient's sensor data on patient's mobile phone, the patient's medical record at the general practitioner's office and the treatment options of a disease in hospital. In this paper, context information has been used for monitoring ECG of heart patient and give an alarm when needed. An alarm to the nearest hospital depending on the critical situation can happen through patient's mobile phone. An ontology based context aware health recommender system proposed thereby helps in critical care of the patient.},

The purpose of this work is to estimate the voting intention associated with each candidate in order to contrast this with the results from classical methods (e.g., polls and surveys). The data are collected from Twitter, because of its high usage in Chile and in the sentiment analysis literature. We obtained tweets associated with the three main candidates: Sebastian Pinera (SP), Alejandro Guillier (AG) and Beatriz Sanchez (BS). For each candidate, we estimated the voting intention and compared it to the traditional methods. To do this, we first acquired the data and labeled the tweets as positive or negative. Afterward, we built a model using machine learning techniques. The classification model had an accuracy of 76.45\% using support vector machines, which yielded the best model for our case. Finally, we use a formula to estimate the voting intention from the number of positive and negative tweets for each candidate. For the last period, we obtained a voting intention of 35.84\% for SP, compared to a range of 34-44\% according to traditional polls and 36\% in the actual elections. For AG we obtained an estimate of 37\%, compared with a range of 15.40\% to 30.00\% for traditional polls and 20.27\% in the elections. For BS we obtained an estimate of 27.77\%, compared with the range of 8.50\% to 11.00\% given by traditional polls and an actual result of 22.70\% in the elections. These results are promising, in some cases providing an estimate closer to reality than traditional polls. Some differences can be explained due to the fact that some candidates have been omitted, even though they held a significant number of votes.},

  abstract = {Originally published as textual documents, clinical practice guidelines have poorly penetrated medical practice because their editorial properties do not allow the reader to easily solve, at the point of care, a given medical problem. However, despite the proliferation of implemented clinical practice guidelines as decision support systems providing an easy access to patient-centered information, there is still little evidence of high physician compliance to guidelines recommendations. Apart from physicians' psychological reluctance, the incompleteness of guideline knowledge and the impreciseness of the terms used, another reason may be that, although suited to average patients, clinical practice guideline recommendations are not a substitute for the physician-controlled clinical judgement that should be applied to each actual individual patient. Therefore, computer-based approaches based on the automation of context-free operationalization of guideline knowledge, although providing uniform optimal strategies to problem-focused care delivery, may generate inappropriate inferences for a specific patient that the physician does not follow in practice. Rather than providing automated decision support, ONCODOC allows the clinician to control the operationalization of guideline knowledge through his hypertextual reading of a knowledge base encoded as a decision tree. In this way, he has the opportunity to interpret the information provided in the context of his patient, therefore, controlling his categorization to the closest matching formal patient. Experimented in life-size ONCODOC demonstrated good appropriation of the system by physicians with significantly high scores of compliance. We successfully tested the implemented strategy and the knowledge base in a second medical institution, giving then a noticeable example of reuse and sharing of encoded guideline knowledge across institutions.},

METHOD(S): This editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2020 IMIA Yearbook which special topic is: "Ethics in Health Informatics". The keynote paper, the survey paper of the Special Topic section, and the paper about Donald Lindberg's ethical scientific openness in the History of Medical Informatics chapter of the Yearbook are discussed. Changes in the Yearbook Editorial Committee are also described. RESULT(S): Inspired by medical ethics, ethics in health informatics progresses with the advances in biomedical informatics. With the wide use of EHRs, the enlargement of the care team perimeter, the need for data sharing for care continuity, the reuse of data for the sake of research, and the implementation of AI-powered decision support tools, new ethics requirements are necessary to address issues such as threats on privacy, confidentiality breaches, poor security practices, lack of patient information, tension on data sharing and reuse policies, need for more transparency on apps effectiveness, biased algorithms with discriminatory outcomes, guarantee on trustworthy AI, concerns on the re-identification of de-identified data. CONCLUSION(S): Despite privacy rules rooted in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA and even more restrictive new regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation published in May 2018, some people do not believe their data will be kept confidential and may not share sensitive information with a provider, which may also induce unethical situations. Transparency on healthcare data processes is a condition of healthcare professionals' and patients' trust and their adoption of digital tools.Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.},

In supervised machine learning, a mathematical function is constructed via automated analysis of training data, which consists of input features (such as retinal images) and output labels (such as the grade of macular edema). With large training data sets and minimal human guidance, a computer learns to generalize from the information contained in the training data. The result is a mathematical function, a model, that can be used to map a new record to the corresponding diagnosis, such as an image to grade macular edema. Although machine learning–based models for classification or for predicting a future health state are being developed for diverse clinical applications, evidence is lacking that deployment of these models has improved care and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Clinical guidelines are a major tool in improving the quality of medical care. However, most guidelines are in free text, are not machine-comprehensible and are not easily accessible to clinicians at the point of care. We have designed and implemented a web-based, modular, distributed architecture, the Digital Electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL), which facilitates gradual conversion of clinical guidelines from text to a formal representation in the chosen target guideline ontology. The architecture supports guideline classification, semantic markup, context-sensitive search, browsing, run-time application and retrospective quality assessment. The DeGeL hybrid meta-ontology includes elements common to all guideline ontologies, such as semantic classification and domain knowledge; it also includes four content-representation formats: free text, semi-structured text, semi-formal representation and a formal representation. These formats support increasingly sophisticated computational tasks. Guidelines can thus be in a hybrid representation in which guidelines, and even parts of the same guideline, might exist at different formalisation levels. We have also developed and rigorously evaluated a methodology and an associated web-based tool, Uruz, for gradually structuring and semi-formalising free-text clinical guidelines. Finally, we have designed, implemented and evaluated a new approach, the hybrid runtime application model for supporting runtime application of clinical guidelines that are not necessarily in a machine-comprehensible format; in particular, when the guideline is in a semi-formal representation and the patient's data are either in an electronic medical record or in a paper format. The tool implementing this new approach, the Spock module, is customised at this point to the Asbru guideline specification language and exploits the hybrid structure of guidelines in DeGeL. The Spock module also exploits our temporal-abstraction mediator to the patient record, IDAN, and our interactive intelligent-visualisation tool, KNAVE-II. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2006.},

Wellness monitoring devices and companion software applications capable of generating alerts and sharing data with health care providers or social networks are now available. The accessibility and clinical utility of such data for disease or wellness research are currently limited. Designing methods for streaming data capture, real-time data aggregation, machine learning, predictive analytics and visualization solutions to integrate wellness or health monitoring data elements with the electronic medical records (EMRs) maintained by health care providers permits better utilization. Integration of population-scale biomedical, health care and wellness data would help to stratify patients for active health management and to understand clinically asymptomatic patients and underlying illness trajectories. In this article, we discuss various health-monitoring devices, their ability to capture the unique state of health represented in a patient and their application in individualized diagnostics, prognosis, clinical or wellness intervention. We also discuss examples of translational bioinformatics approaches to integrating patient-generated data with existing EMRs, personal health records, patient portals and clinical data repositories. Briefly, translational bioinformatics methods, tools and resources are at the center of these advances in implementing real-time biomedical and health care analytics in the clinical setting. Furthermore, these advances are poised to play a significant role in clinical decision-making and implementation of data-driven medicine and wellness care. Copyright © The Author 2016.

It poses a significant threat to the global health and the economy. Physicians face ambiguity in their decision-making for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. In this respect, designing an intelligent system for early diagnosis of the disease is critical for mitigating virus spread and resource optimization. This study aimed to establish an artificial neural network (ANNs)-based clinical model to diagnose COVID-19. The retrospective dataset used in this study consisted of 400 COVID-19 case records (250 positives vs. 150 negatives) and 18 columns for the diagnostic features. The backpropagation technique was used to train a neural network. After designing multiple neural network configurations, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values were calculated to measure the model performance. The two nested loops architecture of 9-10-15-2 (10 and 15 neurons used in layer one and layer two, respectively) with the ROC of 98.2\%, sensitivity of 96.4\%, specificity of 90.6\%, and accuracy of 94 \% were introduced as the best configuration model for COVID-19 diagnosis. ANN is valuable as a decision-support tool for clinicians to improve the COVID-19 diagnosis. It is promising to implement the ANN model to improve the accuracy and speed of the COVID-19 diagnosis for timely screening, treatment, and careful monitoring. Further studies are warranted for verifying and improving the current ANN model.Copyright © 2022 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis can be made by blood, urine, or imaging tests. This study is to design and evaluate a portable electronic phenotype for automated detection and staging of CKD based on electronic health records (EHR). Method(s): With urine tests data of 68,617 patients from three major health care systems (Columbia, Minnesota, and Vanderbilt), we used machine learning to design a universal albuminuria (A-stage) classifier that accommodates five common methods for quantification of urinary protein excretion, including two urine dipstick scales in combination with urine specific gravity. The performance of the classifier for each type of urine test was assessed by a 10-fold cross-validation procedure against matched UACR data. By integrating our A-stage classification with kidney-related diagnostic codes and serum Cr-based eGFR, a rule-based method, each individual is automatically assigned as CKD case or control. Each CKD case is additionally placed on a "staging grid" of albuminuria (A-stage) by eGFR (G-stage). Result(s): The CKD algorithm has been designed, implemented and tested at Columbia University, achieving 100\% and 83\% PPVs for cases and controls respectively by manual chart review. We then performed external validation at Vanderbilt University and Mayo Clinic; where our electronic phenotype had PPVs of 85\% and 98\% for cases and controls, respectively. Based on expert review of 265 charts across all three sites, the PPVs to diagnose CKD Stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4, and 5 were 75\%, 98\%, 95\%, 93\%, 89\%, and 79\%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using machine learning and rule-based methods, we developed and validated a portable CKD diagnosis and staging algorithm in a large multi-center effort. The electronic phenotype follows the latest guidelines and can be applied to both pediatric and adult patients. This algorithm can be implemented within any EHR to enable real-time automated detection and staging of CKD, enabling the implementation of stage-specific clinical decision support tools.},

  abstract = {Online peer-to-peer support platforms enable conversations between millions of people who seek and provide mental health support. If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity, and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation. This work has direct implications for facilitating empathic conversations on web-based platforms.},

  abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks like scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such Human-AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex, creative tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to difficulties of AI systems in understanding complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here, we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop Hailey, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate Hailey in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N=300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our Human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.60\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger 38.88\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyze the Human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social, creative tasks such as empathic conversations.},

The results reveal that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence are positively associated with customers' adoption of autonomous decision-making processes. Collectivism strengthened the positive association of social influence with customer attitude, whereas uncertainty avoidance dampened the associations of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence with attitude.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is the usage of scientific techniques to simulate human intellectual skills and to tackle complex medical issues involving complicated genetic defects such as cancer. The rapid expansion of AI in the past era has paved the way to optimum judgment-making by superior intellect, where the human brain is constrained to manage large information in a limited period. Cancer is a complicated ailment along with several genomic variants. AI-centred systems carry enormous potential in detecting these genomic alterations and abnormal protein communications at a very initial phase. The contemporary biomedical study is also dedicated to bringing AI expertise to hospitals securely and ethically. AI-centred support to diagnosticians and doctors can be the big surge ahead for the forecast of illness threat, identification, diagnosis, and therapies. The applications related to AI and Machine Learning (ML) in the identification of cancer and its therapy possess the potential to provide therapeutic support for quicker planning of a novel therapy for each person. Through the utilization of AI- based methods, scientists can work together in real-time and distribute their expertise digitally to possibly cure billions. In this review, the focus was on the study of linking biology with AI and describe how AI-centred support could assist oncologists in accurate therapy. It is essential to identify new biomarkers that inject drug defiance and discover medicinal goals to improve medication methods. The advent of the "next-generation sequencing" (NGS) programs resolves these challenges and has transformed the prospect of "Precision Oncology" (PO). NGS delivers numerous medical functions which are vital for hazard prediction, initial diagnosis of infection, "Sequence" identification and "Medical Imaging" (MI), precise diagnosis, "biomarker" detection, and recognition of medicinal goals for innovation in medicine. NGS creates a huge repository that requires specific "bioinformatics" sources to examine the information that is pertinent and medically important. The malignancy diagnostics and analytical forecast are improved with NGS and MI that provide superior quality images via AI technology. Irrespective of the advancements in technology, AI faces a few problems and constraints, and the clinical application of NGS continues to be authenticated. Through the steady progress of invention and expertise, the prospects of AI and PO look promising. The purpose of this review was to assess, evaluate, classify, and tackle the present developments in cancer diagnosis utilizing AI methods for breast, lung, liver, skin cancer, and leukaemia. The research emphasizes in what way cancer identification, the treatment procedure is aided by utilizing AI with supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning (DL) methods. Numerous AI methods were assessed on benchmark datasets with respect to "accuracy", "sensitivity", "specificity", and "false-positive" (FP) metrics. Lastly, challenges along with future work were discussed.},

Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health.

Virtual Machine (VM) placement provides a promising technique to save energy and improve resource management which is one of the greatest causes of high energy consumption in the operation of data centers today. A key challenge for VM placement algorithms is the ability to accurately forecast future resource demands due to the dynamic nature of cloud applications. Furthermore, the literature rarely considers placement strategies based on co-located resource consumption which has the potential to improve allocation decisions. Using real workload traces this work presents a comparative study of the most widely used prediction models and introduces our novel Predictive Anti-Correlated Placement Algorithm (PACPA) which considers both CPU and bandwidth resource consumption. Our empirical results demonstrate how the proposed approach reduces energy by 18\% while also reducing service violations by over 34\% compared to some of the most commonly used placement algorithms.},

We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS)., METHODS: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work., RESULTS: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation., CONCLUSIONS: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.

  abstract = {Attention deficits, among other cognitive deficits, are frequently observed in schizophrenia. Although valid and reliable neurocognitive tasks have been established to assess attention deficits in schizophrenia, the hierarchical value of those tests as diagnostic discriminants on a single-subject level remains unclear. Thus, much research is devoted to attention deficits that are unlikely to be translated into clinical practice. On the other hand, a clear hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia could considerably aid diagnostic decisions and may prove beneficial for longitudinal monitoring of therapeutic advances. To propose a diagnostic hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia, we investigated several facets of attention in 86 schizophrenia patients and 86 healthy controls using a set of established attention tests. We applied state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to determine attentive test variables that enable an automated differentiation between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. After feature preranking, hypothesis building, and hypothesis validation, the polynomial support vector machine classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 90.70\% +/- 2.9\% using psychomotor speed and 3 different attention parameters derived from sustained and divided attention tasks. Our study proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia by identifying the most discriminative attention parameters among a variety of attention deficits found in schizophrenia patients.

  abstract = {Background: Healthcare data is a rich yet underutilized resource due to its disconnected, heterogeneous nature. A means of connecting healthcare data and integrating it with additional open and social data in a secure way can support the monumental challenge policy-makers face in safely accessing all relevant data to assist in managing the health and wellbeing of all. The goal of this study was to develop a novel health data platform within the MIDAS (Meaningful Integration of Data Analytics and Services) project, that harnesses the potential of latent healthcare data in combination with open and social data to support evidence-based health policy decision-making in a privacy-preserving manner., Methods: The MIDAS platform was developed in an iterative and collaborative way with close involvement of academia, industry, healthcare staff and policy-makers, to solve tasks including data storage, data harmonization, data analytics and visualizations, and open and social data analytics. The platform has been piloted and tested by health departments in four European countries, each focusing on different region-specific health challenges and related data sources., Results: A novel health data platform solving the needs of Public Health decision-makers was successfully implemented within the four pilot regions connecting heterogeneous healthcare datasets and open datasets and turning large amounts of previously isolated data into actionable information allowing for evidence-based health policy-making and risk stratification through the application and visualization of advanced analytics., Conclusions: The MIDAS platform delivers a secure, effective and integrated solution to deal with health data, providing support for health policy decision-making, planning of public health activities and the implementation of the Health in All Policies approach. The platform has proven transferable, sustainable and scalable across policies, data and regions.

Insight into the reasons why GPs do not use clinical DSS combined with knowledge of why GPs use DSS will allow the development of strategies to facilitate more widespread adoption with consequent improvements across many areas. Depth interviews were conducted with 37 GPs comprising a mix of education backgrounds, experience and gender. The developed model indicated that four main factors influence DSS acceptance and use including usefulness (incorporating consultation issue, professional development and patient presence), facilitating conditions (incorporating workflow, training and integration), ease of use and trust in the knowledge base.},

However, people do not always have accepting attitudes toward smart city services. The purpose of this study was to identify the expectations and anxieties that people have toward five typical services in smart cities (social credit, artificial intelligence (AI) cameras, health information, garbage collection, and automatic vehicles) by using mainly open-ended questions. An online survey was conducted with Japanese participants by presenting them with one of the five vignettes about the services described above. The results showed that the participants' expectations from each service were distinctly different between the vignettes. Anxieties about the leakage of personal information were found for the vignettes of social credit and health information. For the vignettes of AI cameras and garbage collection, anxieties that privacy would not be sufficiently ensured and that people would be involved in a surveillance society were noted. Additionally, the participants tended to exhibit lower accepting attitudes toward services considered to capture a large amount of personal information. We believe that our findings are meaningful to operators leading smart city projects and researchers in urban planning and psychology.},

  abstract = {Oral cavity cancer (OCC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates when diagnosed at late stages. Early detection of increased risk provides an opportunity for implementing prevention strategies surrounding modifiable risk factors and screening to promote early detection and intervention. Historical evidence identified a gap in the training of primary care providers (PCPs) surrounding the examination of the oral cavity. The absence of clinically applicable analytical tools to identify patients with high-risk OCC phenotypes at point-of-care (POC) causes missed opportunities for implementing patient-specific interventional strategies. This study developed an OCC risk assessment tool prototype by applying machine learning (ML) approaches to a rich retrospectively collected data set abstracted from a clinical enterprise data warehouse. We compared the performance of six ML classifiers by applying the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall-precision curves for the derived voting algorithm were: 78\%, 64\%, 88\%, 92\%, 0.83, and 0.81, respectively. The performance of two classifiers, multilayer perceptron and AdaBoost, closely mirrored the voting algorithm. Integration of the OCC risk assessment tool developed by clinical informatics application into an electronic health record as a clinical decision support tool can assist PCPs in targeting at-risk patients for personalized interventional care.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

A more reliable model would allow clinicians to provide better pre-operative risk assessment and develop more targeted therapies for high-risk patients. Methods: We identified adult patients in the United Network for Organ Sharing database undergoing isolated heart transplantation between 01/2009 and 12/2017 who were supported with tMCS at the time of transplant. We constructed a machine learning model using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with a 70:30 train:test split to predict 1-year post-operative mortality. All pre-transplant variables available in the UNOS database were included to train the model. Shapley Additive Explanations was used to identify and interpret the most important features for XGBoost predictions. Results: A total of 1584 patients were included, with a median age of 56 (interquartile range: 46-62) and 74\% male. Actual 1-year mortality was 12.1\%. Out of 498 available variables, 43 were selected for the final model. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) for the XGBoost model was 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.62-0.78). The most important variables predictive of 1-year mortality included recipient functional status, age, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output, ECMO usage, and serum creatinine. Conclusions: An interpretable machine learning model trained on a large clinical database demonstrated good performance in predicting 1-year mortality for patients bridged to heart transplantation with tMCS. Machine learning may be used to enhance clinician judgement in the care of markedly high-risk transplant recipients.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Approximately 300,000 patients present to the emergency department (ED) in the U.S. with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) annually. Use of risk assessment scores in these patients is recommended by guidelines to identify very low risk patients who may be discharged from the ED with outpatient management, but uptake is low. No study has quantified the potential cost savings of consistently using these tools for patients presenting with UGIB. We present a cost minimization analysis that estimates the economic benefit of applying the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) or a machine learning model to guide triage of patients with UGIB. Method(s): We modeled a hypothetical cohort of patients with UGIB using a Markov chain model that followed the cohort from presentation to the ED through either inpatient stay to 28 days post-discharge, or 28 days after discharge from the ED. Two triage strategies are compared to usual care: using GBS=0 or a previously validated machine learning model with comparable sensitivity applied for all patients presenting with UGIB to identify very low risk patients. For each strategy, patients are either admitted to the hospital or discharged from the ED for outpatient care. Assumptions regarding probability of transitioning from one state to another in Table 1 are derived from published data. Our analysis adopts a U.S. health care sector perspective and evaluates direct costs, including validation, implementation and maintenance of risk assessment scores. Inpatient costs and outpatient follow-up costs (clinic visit, outpatient laboratory values, endoscopy) were estimated from Medicare reimbursement tables (Table 1). We chose to use Medicare reimbursement cost because Medicare pays less than other insurers and is a conservative estimate of cost savings when applying either the GBS or the machine learning model. Total initial validation and implementation costs (\$217,519) for year 1 and maintenance costs (\$39,350 each year) for years 2 to 10 per hospital emergency department were applied on a per-patient basis. Result(s): With the GBS threshold of 0, projected cumulative savings at year 2 after implementation are \$346.92 and at year 3 \$1694.52 per patient when the score is applied compared to usual care (Figure 1). Projected savings using a machine learning model at a matched sensitivity threshold are \$1248.27 at year 2 and \$3048.97 at year 3 per patient. Conclusion(s): Full implementation of GBS or machine learning risk assessment model for patients presenting with UGIB is projected to be cost-saving for the U.S. healthcare sector by year 2, with potential nationwide savings of hundreds of millions of dollars annually by year 3. Payers should consider developing novel payment structures to incorporate reimbursement to healthcare systems for the use of clinical decision support tools in patients with UGIB.(Figure Presented) Figure 1: Estimated cumulative cost savings per patient with UGIB when consistently applying GBS=0 or machine learning model with comparable sensitivity to identify very low risk patients as compared to usual care over 10 years.(Table Presented)Table 1: Key Input Parameters and CostsCopyright © 2022, AGA Institute.},

Field studies on whole colonies are limited in behavioural research, while results from lab studies allow only restricted conclusions on whole colony impacts. Methods for automated long-term investigations of behaviours within comb cells, such as brood care, were hitherto missing. In the present study, we demonstrate an innovative video method that enables within-cell analysis in honey bee (Apis mellifera) observation hives to detect chronic sublethal neonicotinoid effects of clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) and thiacloprid (200 ppb) on worker behaviour and development. In May and June, colonies which were fed 10 ppb clothianidin and 200 ppb thiacloprid in syrup over three weeks showed reduced feeding visits and duration throughout various larval development days (LDDs). On LDD 6 (capping day) total feeding duration did not differ between treatments. Behavioural adaptation was exhibited by nurses in the treatment groups in response to retarded larval development by increasing the overall feeding timespan. Using our machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate a novel method for detecting behaviours in an intact hive that can be applied in a versatile manner to conduct impact analyses of chemicals, pests and other stressors.},

The implementation of a Big Data Warehouse can be the first step to improve the organizations' data analysis infrastructure and start retrieving value from the usage of Big Data technologies. Moving to Big Data technologies can provide several opportunities for organizations, such as the capability of analyzing an enormous quantity of data from different data sources in an efficient way. However, at the same time, different challenges can arise, including data quality, data management, and lack of knowledge within the organization, among others.

While the rising costs and healthcare utilization associated with polypharmacy and drug interactions have been well documented, effective tools to address these challenges remain elusive. Emerging evidence that proactive medication management, combined with pharmacogenomic testing, can lead to improved health outcomes and reduced cost burdens may help to address such gaps. In this report, we describe informatic and bioanalytic methodologies that integrate weak signals in symptoms and chief complaints with pharmacogenomic analysis of \textasciitilde 90 single nucleotide polymorphic variants, CYP2D6 copy number, and clinical pharmacokinetic profiles to monitor drug-gene pairs and drug-drug interactions for medications with significant pharmacogenomic profiles. The utility of the approach was validated in a virtual patient case showing detection of significant drug-gene and drug-drug interactions of clinical significance. This effort is being used to establish proof-of-concept for the creation of a regional database to track clinical outcomes in patients enrolled in a bioanalytically-informed medication management program. Our integrated informatic and bioanalytic platform can provide facile clinical decision support to inform and augment medication management in the primary care setting.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

We performed thematic analyses to inform presentation of an explanatory framework and recommendations., RESULTS: We found that ML-based CDS tool development and implementation into clinical workflows proceeded in four phases: iterative solution coidentification, iterative coengagement, iterative coapplication, and iterative corefinement. Each phase is characterized by a collaborative back-and-forth process between the technology's developers and users, through which both users' activities and the technology itself are transformed., CONCLUSION: Health care organizations that anticipate iterative collaboration to be an integral aspect of their ML-based CDS tools' development and implementation process may have more success in deploying ML-based CDS tools that assist end users in their work than organizations that expect a traditional technology innovation process., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Managers developing and implementing ML-based CDS tools should frame the work as a collaborative learning opportunity for both users and the technology itself and should solicit constructive feedback from users on potential changes to the technology, in addition to potential changes to user workflows, in an ongoing, iterative manner.

In India absence of information, and treatment facilities in that of rural and urban zones are the critical issue of concern. Youths have more chances of getting impacted with CVD, due to alcohol usage, smoking, and unfortunate eating routine. In the future, in India by 2030, the prevalence rate might rise to two-fold than 2018. This overview goes for researching progressing propels in understanding the investigation of infection transmission of CVD, causes and the hazard factors related to it. One of the continuous patterns in cardiology at present is the proposed use of man-made consciousness (AI) in increasing and broadening the adequacy of the cardiologist. This is on the grounds that AI or AI would take into consideration an exact proportion of patient working and conclusion from the earliest starting point up to the part of the bargain procedure. Specifically, the utilization of computerized reasoning in cardiology plans to concentrate on innovative work, clinical practice, and populace wellbeing. Made to be an across the board instrument in cardiovascular social insurance, AI innovations consolidate complex calculations in deciding significant advances required for a fruitful finding and treatment. The job of man-made reasoning explicitly reaches out to the recognizable proof of novel medication treatments, illness stratification or insights, persistent remote observing and diagnostics, reconciliation of multi-omic information, and expansion of doctor effectivity and effectiveness. Virtual reality developed during the 1990s in the realm of computer games and has been gradually crawling into medication from that point onward. Today, several specialists are investigating howVR can help treat everything from agoraphobia to consume wounds to stroke. Research recommends utilizing an augmented experience interface can help improve development and coordination of the arms, hands and fingers in stroke survivors.},

  abstract = {Results of a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair (t (t) over barH) in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying tau leptons are presented. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1) recorded in proton-proton collisions at root s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2016. The sensitivity of the search is improved by using matrix element and machine learning methods to separate the signal from backgrounds. The measured signal rate amounts to 1.23(-0.43)(+0.45) times the production rate expected in the standard model, with an observed (expected) significance of 3.2 sigma (2.8 sigma), which represents evidence for t (t) over barH production in those final states. An upper limit on the signal rate of 2.1 times the standard model production rate is set at 95\% confidence level.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) techniques are explored to identify and classify hadronic decays of highly Lorentz-boosted W/Z/Higgs bosons and top quarks. Techniques without ML have also been evaluated and are included for comparison. The identification performances of a variety of algorithms are characterized in simulated events and directly compared with data. The algorithms are validated using proton-proton collision data at root S = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). Systematic uncertainties are assessed by comparing the results obtained using simulation and collision data. The new techniques studied in this paper provide significant performance improvements over non-ML techniques, reducing the background rate by up to an order of magnitude at the same signal efficiency.},

  abstract = {The CP-violating weak phase ?s and the decay width difference ??s between the light and heavy B0s mass eigenstates are measured with the CMS detector at the LHC in a sample of 48 500 reconstructed B0s? J/I) d (1020) ?11+11? K+K? events. The measurement is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 96.4 fb?1, collected in proton-proton collisions at ?s = 13 TeV in 2017?2018. To extract the values of ?s and ??s, a time-dependent and flavor-tagged angular analysis of the 11+11?K+K? final state is performed. The analysis employs a dedicated tagging trigger and a novel opposite-side muon flavor tagger based on machine learning techniques. The measurement yields ?s = ?11 ?50 (stat) ? 10 (syst) mrad and ??s = 0.114 ? 0.014 (stat)? 0.007 (syst) ps?1, in agreement with the standard model predictions. When combined with the previous CMS measurement at ?s = 8 TeV, the following values are obtained: ?s = ?21 ? 44 (stat) ? 10 (syst) mrad, ??s = 0.1032 ? 0.0095 (stat) ? 0.0048 (syst) ps?1, a significant improvement over the 8 TeV result. ? 2021 The Author(s).

We also examine the state of education relating to AI amongst this cohort.                                            Methods                UK medical students were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey consisting of Likert and dichotomous questions.                                            Results                                  Four hundred eighty-four responses were received from 19 UK medical schools. Eighty-eight percent of students believed that AI will play an important role in healthcare, and 49\% reported they were less likely to consider a career in radiology due to AI. Eighty-nine percent of students believed that teaching in AI would be beneficial for their careers, and 78\% agreed that students should receive training in AI as part of their medical degree. Only 45 students received any teaching on AI; none of the students received such teaching as part of their compulsory curriculum. Statistically, students that did receive teaching in AI were more likely to consider radiology (                  p                  \,=\,0.01) and rated more positively to the questions relating to the perceived competence in the post-graduation use of AI (                  p                  \,=\,0.01–0.04); despite this, a large proportion of students in the taught group reported a lack of confidence and understanding required for the critical use of healthcare AI tools.                                                            Conclusions                UK medical students understand the importance of AI and are keen to engage. Medical school training on AI should be expanded and improved. Realistic use cases and limitations of AI must be presented to students so they will not feel discouraged from pursuing radiology.},

  abstract = {Purpose Computer algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) will be integrated into clinical decision support within occupational health care. This will change the interaction between health care professionals and their clients, with unknown consequences. The aim of this study was to explore ethical considerations and potential consequences of using ML based decision support tools (DSTs) in the context of occupational health. Methods We conducted an ethical deliberation. This was supported by a narrative literature review of publications about ML and DSTs in occupational health and by an assessment of the potential impact of ML-DSTs according to frameworks from medical ethics and philosophy of technology. We introduce a hypothetical clinical scenario from a workers' health assessment to reflect on biomedical ethical principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Results Respect for autonomy is affected by uncertainty about what future consequences the worker is consenting to as a result of the fluctuating nature of ML-DSTs and validity evidence used to inform the worker. A beneficent advisory process is influenced because the three elements of evidence based practice are affected through use of a ML-DST. The principle of non-maleficence is challenged by the balance between group-level benefits and individual harm, the vulnerability of the worker in the occupational context, and the possibility of function creep. Justice might be empowered when the ML-DST is valid, but profiling and discrimination are potential risks. Conclusions Implications of ethical considerations have been described for the socially responsible design of ML-DSTs. Three recommendations were provided to minimize undesirable adverse effects of the development and implementation of ML-DSTs.},

More recent approaches rely on analytics techniques to automatically mine EHR data to reveal meaningful insights. Here, we propose the Knowledge-Analytics Synergy paradigm for CDS, in which we synergistically combine existing relevant knowledge with analytics applied to EHR data. We propose a framework for implementing such a paradigm and demonstrate its principles over real-world clinical and genomic data of hypertensive patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The technology of grid services is developing fast. This paper presents an approach to the implementation of an intelligent grid service that configures a hospital taking advantage of the knowledge logistics idea., METHODS: The presented approach is based on synergistic integration of knowledge acquired from distributed sources in order to obtain new or complement insufficient knowledge. Presented approach uses ontologies and the formalism of object-oriented constraint networks for knowledge representation and applies ILOG to constraint-based problem solving., RESULTS: The application of the approach is illustrated via a decision support system for a fictitious case study of a hospital configuration in the Binni region. The system showed the ability to produce interrelated solutions for subtasks of the hospital configuration task based on the built ontology and input parameters. Besides, such preferences as cost or time minimization are also considered by the implemented fuzzy logic module that finds a feasible solution., CONCLUSIONS: KL would benefit from the grid, and particularly from the concept of a semantic grid. The scalable architecture of the approach enables its extension with regard to knowledge/information sources number and, thereby, with regard to factors taken into account during complex problem solving. Utilizing ontologies allows integration of the approach into existing processes and facilitates knowledge sharing with similar systems. Application of constraint networks allows rapid problem manipulation and usage of such existing efficient technologies as ILOG.},

Acquiring such data has become technically easier than ever. The proper utilization of these data leads, hypothetically, to better understanding of mobile user behavior and, consequently, to enhanced mobile services. Design/methodology/approach - The paper systematically compares, under multiple experimental settings, the predictive performances of models built with three different approaches (pre-filtering, contextual modeling and post-filtering) used for incorporating contextual data into user behavior models. The comparisons focus on by which approach additional semantic place information can be best utilized for making the most accurate inferences on mobile user behavior. Real-life smartphone usage data are utilized in the analysis. Findings - The results demonstrate that none of the considered approaches uniformly dominate the others across all experimental settings. However, they show circumstance specific differences that need to be aligned with practical use cases for the best performance. Practical implications - Identifying the most suitable approaches for utilizing the semantic place (and other contextual) data is an important practical problem for electronic service providers, whose offerings are increasingly moving to the mobile domain and thus need to respond to the demands of mobility. Originality/value - The paper constitutes an initial step toward understanding and systematically evaluating different approaches for incorporating semantic place data into modeling mobile user behavior. Practitioners in the mobile service domain can apply the initial results and academics build upon them with more diverse experimental settings.},

In addition, they have become powerful tools in modern hospital management. This growing interest in Patient Dependency Systems has renewed calls for their automation. As advances in Information Technology and in particular Knowledge-Based Engineering reach new heights, hospitals can no longer afford to ignore the potential benefits obtainable from developing and implementing Patient Dependency Knowledge-Based Systems. Experience has shown that the vast majority of decisions and rules used in the Patient Dependency method are too complex to capture in the form of a traditional programming language. Furthermore, the conventional Patient Dependency Information System automates the simple and rigid bookkeeping functions. On the other hand Knowledge-Based Systems automate complex decision making and judgmental processes and therefore are the appropriate technology for automating the Patient Dependency method. In this paper a new technique to automate Patient Dependency Systems using knowledge processing is presented. In this approach all Patient Dependency factors have been translated into a set of Decision Rules suitable for use in a Knowledge-Based System. The system is capable of providing the decision-maker with a number of scenarios and their possible outcomes. This paper also presents the development of Patient Dependency Knowledge-Based Systems, which can be used in allocating and evaluating resources and nursing staff in hospitals on the basis of patients' needs.},

Afterword, rod-like Multi CNC-PANI served as a dynamic bridge endowed those hydrogels hierarchical structure and dynamic hydrogen bond interactions doped with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/borax system. Combined with the dynamic borate ester bonds, the biomimetic nanocomposite hydrogels had high breaking strength (171.52 KPa), ultra-stretchability (1085\%), rapid self-healing properties, adhesiveness, decent biocompatibility, and sensitivity. Especially, the hydrogels could keep good self-healing ability both in air and underwater without any stimuli, and the self-healing efficiency could reach up to 99.56\% within 120 s. This hydrogel sensor could sensitively detect and distinguish human motions including swallow, fingers, wrist, elbow and knee joints, in real-time. Besides, the self-healed hydrogel gave detective signal with uniform and repeatable sensitivity, which endowed the hydrogels mechanically adaptability and good store stability. Therefore, the strategy may provide unique opportunities in designing biomimetic sensors with skin-like mechanical stretchability, sensitivity and self-healing properties.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) has many benefits, so its use has spread rapidly, particularly in the business sector. An important consideration in the acceptance of CC is whether the CC system is dependable, and it can differ among industry and service type. However, little research has considered the effect of dependability (composed of availability, reliability, security, maintainability) on CC acceptance. Especially, group comparisons between high IT-intensive (Hi-ITi) and low IT-intensive (Lo-ITi) industries have not been reported, nor have comparisons between software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS)/infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). This study aims to explore how the dependability of CC affects users' intent to accept it, with focus on how this intent is affected by intensity of IT use (by industry) and by the type of CC service used. To validate the proposed model, this study applied structural equation modeling and conducted multi-group analysis. A total of 230 business managers in South Korea represent the sample for our study. For the full dataset, the three dependability attributes (availability, reliability, security) do not affect the usefulness of CC, but do affect the ease of use of CC. The usefulness of CC is a determinant for positive intention to accept CC, whereas the ease of use of CC is not. Maintainability is the strongest determinant of CC adoption for the full dataset, and for all individual groups, except those that use SaaS. For Hi-ITi and Lo-ITi industries, results show that managers show no differences in their perceptions of the effect of dependability attributes (availability, reliability, security) on the usefulness and the ease of CC. The absence of such a difference in managers' perception also applies to the relationship between two core variables of TAM (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and behavioral intention to accept CC. For SaaS and PaaS/IaaS, managers have different perceptions of security on the usefulness of CC, and the effect of the usefulness of CC on the intention to accept CC. The findings can provide academic researchers and industry practitioners with a differentiated and in-depth perspective on the understanding and the spread of CC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) for decision support for a Crisis Standards of Care team., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the electronic health record (EHR) by combining 5 previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index., RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27 296 encounters, of which 1358 (5.0\%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4494 (16.5\%) required intensive care unit care, 1480 (5.4\%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6\%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85., DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction., CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.

  abstract = {Objective: Underage drinking is widely recognized as a leading public health and social problem for adolescents in the United States. Being able to identify at-risk adolescents before they initiate heavy alcohol use could have important clinical and public health implications; however, few investigations have explored individual-level precursors of adolescent substance use. This prospective investigation used machine learning with demographic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data in substance-naive adolescents to identify predictors of alcohol use initiation by age 18. Method: Participants (N=137) were healthy substancenaive adolescents (ages 12-14) who underwent neuropsychological testing and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI), and then were followed annually. By age 18, 70 youths (51\%) initiated moderate to heavy alcohol use, and 67 remained nonusers. Random forest classification models identified the most important predictors of alcohol use from a large set of demographic, neuropsychological, sMRI, and fMRI variables. Results: Random forest models identified 34 predictors contributing to alcohol use by age 18, including several demographic and behavioral factors (being male, higher socioeconomic status, early dating, more externalizing behaviors, positive alcohol expectancies), worse executive functioning, and thinner cortices and less brain activation in diffusely distributed regions of the brain. Conclusions: Incorporating a mix of demographic, behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data may be the best strategy for identifying youths at risk for initiating alcohol use during adolescence. The identified risk factors will be useful for alcohol prevention efforts and in research to address brain mechanisms that may contribute to early drinking.},

  abstract = {The filtration through machine learning approaches can solves many problems in diagnosis of MRI brain. Various medical image applications are available in usage but they are offering limited solutions at diagnosis process. Therefore disease diagnosis performance is improved by proposed CNN (convolution neural networks)-GB (Gradient Boosting) and adaptive median filter (AMF) mechanism. In this work, brain-related disorders have been identified by using deep learning and machine learning technique. So brain-correlated information purpose real-time MRI medical images and "FIGSHARE", "OASIS" datasets are collected. These are having more information of disease identification and classification. Various filters like Gaussian filter, median filters unable to remove the noise in medical images, when density of noise is more than 78\% so that an advanced filters design is necessary for a fast and accurate brain disease diagnosis. In this research CNN-ML based adaptive median filter is designed for noise exclusion and effective diseases identification. PSNR, MSE, True positive rate and accuracy parameters can describe the application efficiency. MRI brain diseases investigation with CNN-AMF and GBML model has achieved 0.9863-accuracy and 0.9832-True Positive Rate, which is a better improvement. This implemented design and improved results are compete with current medical research applications, also useful for doctors, researchers and Diagnosis centers.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary emboli represent clinically significant pathology with a high risk of mortality, particularly in cases of delayed or missed diagnoses. It is definitively diagnosed via computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and hence prompt recognition for urgent anticoagulation and/or thrombectomy correlates with reduced morbidity and mortality rates. It is posited within the literature that there may be as high as a 13\% discrepancy rate for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism between reporting radiologists during day shift compared to night shift: raising consideration for automation as a supplementary tool. Early attempts on developing an automated pulmonary embolism diagnosis has focused on clinical variables or nuclear medicine imaging with modest success and limited applications in the wider setting. Traditionally, artificial intelligence has required a high burden on manual engineering, complex processing and infrastructure costs. Paired with poor external validation, it has had limited generalisability to the patient population. With the advent of machine learning, there are a number of constructed deep learning models that are better capable of automatically detecting pulmonary emboli on CTPA. The existing convolutional neural networks and other machine learning approaches were assessed for their prediction performance of diagnosing acute pulmonary emboli in this paper: there are limitations inherent in the models however they may achieve a sensitivity of up to 0.75 and specificity of up to 0.80. An ideal deep learning model would be capable of detecting pulmonary emboli using the entire CTPA with interpretation at the volumetric level with robust application to external data. Fundamentally any machine learning model would be a clinical decision-support tool to improve the use of CT, utilised in conjunction with the radiologist and therefore will resolutely remain under the direction of the radiologist. Learning Objectives: 1.To understand the fundamentals of machine learning and its related jargon. 2. To discern the quality of machine learning in suspected acute pulmonary emboli. 3. To consider areas of improvement to aid the incorporation of artificial intelligence into future clinical practice. Background(s): In Australia, there are approximately 17,000 new cases of venous thromboembolism annually, with pulmonary emboli accounting for approximately 40\% of these cases.1 In 2015, this accounted for 0.2\% of deaths in Australia. 1 It is considered that the rate of interpretative errors in radiology are estimated at a global rate of 4\%.2,3 The published literature describes varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity of CTPA to accurately determine pulmonary emboli however it has quoted to be of 90\% sensitivity and 95\% specificity.2,3 Indeterminate CTPA findings have been quoted to be a rate of 6.6.\%.4 This margin of error may be mitigated by the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence can broadly be categorised into two main methods: machine learning (ML) techniques that are capable of analysing specific types of data which include genetic information, clinical imaging and electrophysiological data. 5,6 For example, ML techniques attempt to extrapolate the probability of disease based on patient's clinical data. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques select specific data based on clinical text to enhance the quality of the medical data and subsequently this assessment of data by NLP techniques renders the data available for analysis by ML techniques. ML algorithms can be subdivided into two categories: unsupervised learning and supervised learning.5 Unsupervised learning is programmed to target a particular feature or aspect in question in the dataset and in comparison, supervised learning is designed for probability modelling by building an association between patient traits and the outcome of interest. 5,6 Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid form of learning which is suitable where there are missing data points. Supervised learning is prominent in artificial intelligence in healthcare due to its clinical applications. Neural networks are an extension of basic linear regression relationships that capture complex non-linear relationships between particular given variables of interest and a desired outcome.6 The relationships have multiple hidden layer combinations of pre-specified functions. For example, this application may be used to predict a diagnosis of stroke. Deep learning is a modern extension of neural networks, with complex non-linear patterns in the data that is beyond the capability of common neural networks. 6 Clinical imaging is inherently complex and naturally high-dimensional as each image contains thousands of pixels. 7 The normalized pixel values of the clinical images are obtained and used as the inputs for the convolutional neural networks. It provides the highest standard to accurately diagnose pulmonary emboli on CTPA.7 Fundamentally, artificial intelligence is largely targeted towards the acute variant of pulmonary emboli and hence there are limitations in its propensity to accurately diagnose chronic pulmonary emboli.7 Future research would be beneficial in delineating this hence the radiologist is invaluable in evaluating these subtle differences. 8 Health services may develop their own or apply the CNN to their data sets retrospectively to ascertain its value. Prior to any such investigation to implementation, it is imperative to have appropriate clinical governance and ethical infrastructures in place. 9. (Figure Presented).},

While many papers have been published on related topics-such as algorithm development, human-robot communication, laws, and legislation surrounding AI-the psychological impacts of its implementation in workplaces are still largely unknown. Furthermore, existing theoretical models of AI effects do not incorporate psychological outcomes, which translates into a major gap in the scientific literature. Therefore, this study's purpose was to empirically verify a newly developed theoretical model that integrates one individual determinant (e.g., general mental ability [GMA]) and the psychological outcomes of AI in the workplace (e.g., the effects of AI perceived usefulness on the basic psychological needs and psychological health). To that end, five hundred forty-six employees (46.7\% women and 53.3\% men) working at least 20 hr per week in various Canadian organizations answered several online questionnaires. Collected data were analyzed using path analysis. First, the results of this study showed that the GMA-level influences AI perceived usefulness-level, which in turn determines its positive or negative perception. This perception differentially impacts employees' satisfaction or thwarting of basic psychological needs and also indirectly their psychological health. By combining three different theoretical approaches, this study contributes to connecting interdisciplinary knowledge of AI impacts on workers' psychological health and to reducing gaps between related research fields.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate if nanoradiomics (radiomic analysis of nanoparticle contrast-enhanced images) can differentiate tumors based on TAM burden. Materials and Methods. In vivo studies were performed in transgenic mouse models of neuroblastoma with low (N = 11) and high (N = 10) tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) burden. Animals underwent delayed nanoparticle contrast-enhanced CT (n-CECT) imaging at 4 days after intravenous administration of liposomal-iodine agent (1.1 g/kg). CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics (tumor volume and CT attenuation) were computed for segmented tumor CT datasets. Nanoradiomic analysis was performed using a PyRadiomics workflow implemented in the quantitative image feature pipeline (QIFP) server containing 900 radiomic features (RFs). RF selection was performed under supervised machine learning using a nonparametric neighborhood component method. A 5-fold validation was performed using a set of linear and nonlinear classifiers for group separation. Statistical analysis was performed using the KruskalWallis test. Results. N-CECT imaging demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of signal enhancement in low and high TAM tumors. CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics showed no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05) in tumor volume between low and high TAM tumors. Tumor CT attenuation was not significantly different (P {$>$} 0.05) between low and high TAM tumors. Machine learning-augmented nanoradiomic analysis revealed two RFs that differentiated (P {$<$} 0.002) low TAM and high TAM tumors. The RFs were used to build a linear classifier that demonstrated very high accuracy and further confirmed by 5-fold cross-validation. Conclusions. Imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics were unable to differentiate tumors with varying TAM burden; however, nanoradiomic analysis revealed texture differences and enabled differentiation of low and high TAM tumors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) holds the promise of becoming an essential tool for utilising the increasing amount of clinical data available for analysis and clinical decision support. However, the lack of trust in the models has limited the acceptance of this technology in healthcare. This mistrust is often credited to the shortage of model explainability and interpretability, where the relationship between the input and output of the models is unclear. Improving trust requires the development of more transparent ML methods., METHODS: In this paper, we use the publicly available eICU database to construct a number of ML models before examining their internal behaviour with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our four models predicted hospital mortality in ICU patients using a selection of the same features used to calculate the APACHE IV score and were based on random forest, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and adaptive boosting algorithms., RESULTS: The results showed the models had similar discriminative abilities and mostly agreed on feature importance while calibration and impact of individual features differed considerably and did in multiple cases not correspond to common medical theory., CONCLUSIONS: We already know that ML models treat data differently depending on the underlying algorithm. Our comparative analysis visualises implications of these differences and their importance in a healthcare setting. SHAP value analysis is a promising method for incorporating explainability in model development and usage and might yield better and more trustworthy ML models in the future. Copyright © 2022.

Equally underused are the electronic health records (EHRs), which house enormous amounts of health data, but the power of that "big data" has failed to be capitalized on., METHODS: Early attempts at EBGs were rigid and nonadaptive; however, with the current advances in data informatics and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to integrate "big data" and rapid data processing into clinical decision support tools. We have presented an overview of the background of EHRs and EBGs in neurosurgery and explored the possibility of integrating them to reduce unwanted variance., RESULTS: As we strive toward variance reduction in healthcare, the integration of "big data" and EBGs for decision-making will be key. We have proposed that EHRs are an ideal platform for integrating EBGs into the clinician workflow and have presented as an example of a successful early generation model, Neurocore. With this approach, it will be possible to build EBGs into the EHR software, to continuously update and optimize EBGs according to the flow of patient data into the EHR, and to present data-driven clinical decision support at the point of care., CONCLUSIONS: Variance reduction in neurosurgery through the integration of evidence-based decision support in EHRs will lead to improved patient safety, a reduction in medical errors, maximization of the use of the available data, and enhanced decision-making power for clinicians.

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is an efficient and cost-effective method of diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, nondiagnostic HSAT necessitates additional tests that erode these benefits, delaying diagnoses and increasing costs. Our objective was to optimize this diagnostic pathway by using predictive modeling to identify patients who should be referred directly to polysomnography (PSG) due to their high probability of nondiagnostic HSAT., METHODS: HSAT performed as the initial test for suspected OSA within the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System was analyzed retrospectively. Data were extracted from pre-HSAT questionnaires and the medical record. Tests were diagnostic if there was a respiratory event index (REI) {$>$}= 5 events/h. Tests with REI {$<$} 5 events/h or technical inadequacy-two outcomes requiring additional testing with PSG-were considered nondiagnostic. Standard logistic regression models were compared with models trained using machine learning techniques., RESULTS: Models were trained using 80\% of available data and validated on the remaining 20\%. Performance was evaluated using partial area under the precision-recall curve (pAUPRC). Machine learning techniques consistently yielded higher pAUPRC than standard logistic regression, which had pAUPRC of 0.574. The random forest model outperformed all other models (pAUPRC 0.862). Preferred calibration of this model yielded the following: sensitivity 0.46, specificity 0.95, positive predictive value 0.81, negative predictive value 0.80., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard logistic regression models, machine learning models improve prediction of patients requiring in-laboratory PSG. These models could be implemented into a clinical decision support tool to help clinicians select the optimal test to diagnose OSA. Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is less expensive and more convenient for patients compared to in-lab polysomnography (PSG). Nondiagnostic studies (i.e. AHI {$<$} 5/hr or technically inadequate) erode both these benefits due to need for repeat HSAT or PSG to establish a diagnosis. We explored several predictive modeling approaches to develop an algorithm to predict the pre-test probability of patients having a nondiagnostic HSAT. Method(s): We analyzed data for 614 patients who underwent HSAT using a Respironics StarDust II device as the initial test for OSA at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Only patients without a prior sleep disorder diagnosis or prior sleep study were included. All patients completed a pre-study questionnaire containing multiple validated instruments (i.e. STOPBANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Berlin Questionnaire and Brief Restless Legs Questionnaire). Demographics, anthropomorphic measurements and comorbidities were extracted from the VA Computerized Patient Record System. The dataset was split into training and testing sets in a 4:1 ratio via random sampling within each outcome class to maintain the overall class distribution. Missing data was handled via mixed methods including a 'minimum viable data' approach and imputation using k-nearest neighbors (KNN). We compared standard logistic regression - with and without LASSO/Ridge regularization - against machine learning techniques including KNN, gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Model training optimized Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), a suitable metric for an unbalanced dataset. Validation was performed using k-fold repeated cross-validation on the training dataset, followed by outer validation using the testing dataset. Result(s): As shown in Figure 1, the GBDT model performed best (AUPRC on test dataset: 0.666). Using a probability threshold of 0.55, model sensitivity and specificity were 0.41 and 0.98. Implementing this model to guide testing of every 1,000 patients would result in a 9.4\% (N=123) reduction in total sleep studies performed, characterized by a 13.9\% (N=139) decrease in HSATs and 5.3\% (N=16) increase in PSGs. Furthermore, 40.6\% (N=123) fewer patients would require both HSAT and PSG due to increased yield of first-time sleep studies from 69.7\% to 82.0\%. Conclusion(s): Machine learning can improve efficiency in the diagnosis of OSA. Future work will focus on validation in a larger and more diverse population, followed by implementation into a clinical decision support tool. (Figure Preseted).},

Materials and methods Using an embedded multiple case study, an exploratory, qualitative research design was followed. Data collection consisted of 24 semi-structured interviews from seven Dutch hospitals. The analysis of barriers and facilitators was guided by the recently published Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework for new medical technologies in healthcare organizations. Results Among the most important facilitating factors for implementation were the following: (i) pressure for cost containment in the Dutch healthcare system, (ii) high expectations of AI's potential added value, (iii) presence of hospital-wide innovation strategies, and (iv) presence of a "local champion." Among the most prominent hindering factors were the following: (i) inconsistent technical performance of AI applications, (ii) unstructured implementation processes, (iii) uncertain added value for clinical practice of AI applications, and (iv) large variance in acceptance and trust of direct (the radiologists) and indirect (the referring clinicians) adopters. Conclusion In order for AI applications to contribute to the improvement of the quality and efficiency of clinical radiology, implementation processes need to be carried out in a structured manner, thereby providing evidence on the clinical added value of AI applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, health applications based on the internet of medical things have exploded in popularity in smart cities (IoMT). Many real-time systems help both patients and professionals by allowing remote data access and appropriate responses. The major research problems include making timely medical judgments and efficiently managing massive data utilising IoT-based resources. Furthermore, in many proposed solutions, the dispersed nature of data processing openly raises the risk of information leakage and compromises network integrity. Medical sensors are burdened by such solutions, which reduce the stability of real-time transmission systems. As a result, this study provides a machine-learning approach with SDN-enabled security to forecast network resource usage and enhance sensor data delivery. With a low administration cost, the software define network (SDN) design allows the network to resist dangers among installed sensors. It provides an unsupervised machine learning approach that reduces IoT network communication overheads and uses dynamic measurements to anticipate link status and refines its tactics utilising SDN architecture. Finally, the SDN controller employs a security mechanism to efficiently regulate the consumption of IoT nodes while also protecting them against unidentified events. When the number of nodes and data production rate varies, the suggested approach enhances network speed. As a result, to organise the nodes in a cluster, the suggested model uses an iterative centroid technique. By balancing network demand via durable connections, the multihop transmission technique for routing IoT data improves speed while simultaneously lowering the energy hole problem.},

  abstract = {The authors have carried out a systematic review of the literature devoted to the current state of and prospects for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of maternal and fetal health. They have revealed the concept of AI and the ways of its development in medicine. It has been noted that AI does not replace a physician, but it is a tool for improving medical activity. The article shows the possibilities of AI use in obstetrics and gynecology and highlights its areas: medical image recognition; prediction and assistance to physicians in determining the diagnosis; creation of recommendation systems for selecting a treatment; robotization of medical manipulations and augmented reality; optimization of the routine functions of healthcare workers; services for interaction and training of physicians and patients. In addition, AI can be used for scientific purposes to understand complex multifactorial mechanisms for the development of diseases; to create disease information models, new classifications of diseases, and models of therapeutic effects. AI is also able to automatically retrieve new medical information from clinical case reports and scientific publications. The paper gives specific examples of developments in these areas. It considers the expected difficulties in introducing AI systems and describes immediate steps for their implementation. The development of AI systems requires physicians' direct participation, including the selection and preparation of data, the formulation of medical tasks, and their translation into the language of machine learning specialists. It is concluded that AI-based applications in obstetrics and gynecology have already become a reality, and in the near future they will reduce the burden on medical professionals, improve the effectiveness of diagnosis, prediction, and treatment, and prevent medical errors. It is promising to use AI in telemedicine systems to provide assistance to physicians and patients outside the locations of large medical complexes. Conclusion. The results of the review can be used to identify promising researches, to develop a national program for AI introduction in obstetric and gynecological practice and in educational programs, and to improve the qualification of healthcare workers.Copyright © A group of authors, 2021.},

The number of Americans with multiple chronic diseases is projected to increase from 57 million in 2000 to 81 million in 2020. However, behavioral medicine and health psychology, while focusing on the co-occurrence of psychological/psychiatric disorders with primary medical morbidities, have historically tended to ignore the co-occurrence of primary medical comorbidities, such as diabetes and cancer, and their biopsychosocial implications. This approach may hinder our ecologically valid understanding of the etiology, prevention, and treatment for individual patients with multimorbidity. In this selective review, we propose a heuristic behavioral framework for the etiology of multimorbidity. More acknowledgment and systematic research on multiple, co-existing disorders in behavioral medicine are consistent with the biopsychosocial model's emphasis on treating the "whole person," which means not considering any single illness, its symptoms, risk factors, or mechanisms, in isolation. As systems analytics, big data, machine learning, and mixed-model trajectory analyses, among others, come online and become more widely available, we may be able to tackle multimorbidity more holistically, efficiently, and satisfactorily.Copyright © 2016 by the American Psychosomatic Society.},

The primary outcomes of study include uptake and coverage of the screening program and adherence to follow-up. These outcomes will be evaluated through a pre-post quasi-experimental study design. Secondary objectives of the study include the analysis of client-related factors and health system factors related to cervical cancer screening, a validation study of an artificial intelligence decision support system and an economic evaluation of the screening strategy., DISCUSSION: PRESCRIP-TEC aims to provide evidence regarding hrHPV self-testing and the World Health Organization's recommendations for cervical cancer screening in a variety of settings, targeting vulnerable groups. The main quantitative findings of the project related to the impact on uptake and coverage of screening will be complemented by qualitative analyses of various determinants of successful implementation of screening.

  abstract = {Clinical decision support systems are assisting physicians in providing care to patients. However, in the context of clinical pathway management such systems are rather limited as they only take the current state of the patient into account and ignore the possible evolvement of that state in the future. In the past decade, the availability of big data in the healthcare domain did open a new era for clinical decision support. Machine learning technologies are now widely used in the clinical domain, nevertheless, mostly as a tool for disease prediction. A tool that not only predicts future states, but also enables adaptive clinical pathway management based on these predictions is still in need. This paper introduces weighted state transition logic, a logic to model state changes based on actions planned in clinical pathways. Weighted state transition logic extends linear logic by taking weights - numerical values indicating the quality of an action or an entire clinical pathway - into account. It allows us to predict the future states of a patient and it enables adaptive clinical pathway management based on these predictions. We provide an implementation of weighted state transition logic using semantic web technologies, which makes it easy to integrate semantic data and rules as background knowledge. Executed by a semantic reasoner, it is possible to generate a clinical pathway towards a target state, as well as to detect potential conflicts in the future when multiple pathways are coexisting. The transitions from the current state to the predicted future state are traceable, which builds trust from human users on the generated pathway. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Through this study, we employed a participatory action design and engineering (PADE) approach in developing the hardware and user interface to increase the likelihood of eventually yielding a device effective for both MWU and clinicians. Participants Focus Groups: Ten clinicians - 6 physical therapists, 3 occupational therapists, and one registered nurse, and 10 MWU with spinal cord injuries (SCI) who reported using their wheelchairs 40-80 h per week. Five-Day Assessment: Five male MWU with SCI who had been wheelchair users for 18.5 +/- 16.2 years. Four-Week Investigation: The 7 participants with SCI were 5 males and 2 females, who had been wheelchair users for 24.7 +/- 17.0 years. Methods A PADE approach was used to improve upon a manual wheelchair virtual coaching system for people with SCI. The system comprises a seat support instrumented with force sensors, software algorithms to detect PR, and a smart phone app for user interface. The methods included three stages: multiple focus groups, a five-day evaluation phase with participants using their own wheelchairs in their homes and communities, and a 4-week assessment with improvements made based on the 5-day results by users with their own wheelchairs in their homes and communities. Results The focus groups yielded guidance for ergonomics, user interface, charging frequency, and key dimensions and mass. The 5-day study identified mechanical, electrical, and connectivity challenges, which were resolved before the 4-week study. The 4-week trial suggested that participants performed PR less frequently than clinically recommended and provided an indication of the types of maneuvers that they performed. Conclusion A prototype manual wheelchair virtual coaching system was developed using a PADE process. The system was able to detect and record PR in home and community environments. Following improvements identified in this study, a future version will be tested with additional users to determine whether it can improve adherence to PR guidance.},

Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human–AI interaction (HAII) in particular.

  abstract = {Purpose: To conduct a prospective observational study across 12 U.S. hospitals to evaluate real-time performance of an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 95 363 chest radiographs were included in model training, external validation, and real-time validation. The model was deployed as a clinical decision support system, and performance was prospectively evaluated. There were 5335 total real-time predictions and a COVID-19 prevalence of 4.8\% (258 of 5335). Model performance was assessed with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis, precision-recall curves, and F1 score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race and sex with AI model diagnostic accuracy. To compare model accuracy with the performance of board-certified radiologists, a third dataset of 1638 images was read independently by two radiologists. Result(s): Participants positive for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 diagnostic scores than participants negative for COVID-19 (me-dian, 0.1 [IQR, 0.0-0.8] vs 0.0 [IQR, 0.0-0.1], respectively; P, .001). Real-time model performance was unchanged over 19 weeks of implementation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.73). Model sensitivity was higher in men than women (P = .01), whereas model specificity was higher in women (P = .001). Sensitivity was higher for Asian (P = .002) and Black (P = .046) participants compared with White participants. The COVID-19 AI diagnostic system had worse accuracy (63.5\% correct) compared with radiologist predictions (radiologist 1 = 67.8\% correct, radiologist 2 = 68.6\% correct; McNemar P, .001 for both). Conclusion(s): AI-based tools have not yet reached full diagnostic potential for COVID-19 and underperform compared with radiologist prediction.Copyright © RSNA, 2022.},

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of CDSS on breathlessness and associated diseases in real-world clinical settings. Studies published between 1 January 2000 to 10 September 2021 were systematically obtained from 14 electronic research databases including CENTRAL, Embase, Pubmed, and clinical trial registries. Main outcomes of interest were patient health outcomes, provider use, diagnostic concordance, economic evaluation, and unintended consequences. The review protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020163141). A total of 4294 records were screened and 37 studies included of which 30 were RCTs. Twenty studies were in primary care, 13 in hospital outpatient/emergency department (ED), and the remainder mixed. Study duration ranged from 2 weeks to 5 years. Most were adults (58\%). Five CDSS were focused on assessment, one on assessment and management, and the rest on disease-specific management. Most studies were disease-specific, predominantly focused on asthma (17 studies), COPD (2 studies), or asthma and COPD (3 studies). CDSS for COPD, heart failure, and asthma in adults reported clinical benefits such as reduced exacerbations, improved quality of life, improved patient-reported outcomes or reduced mortality. Studies identified low usage as the main barrier to effectiveness. Clinicians identified dissonance between CDSS recommendations and real-world practice as a major barrier. This review identified potential benefits of CDSS implementation in primary care and outpatient services for adults with heart failure, COPD, and asthma in improving diagnosis, compliance with guideline recommendations, promotion of non-pharmacological interventions, and improved clinical outcomes including mortality.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).},

Translating these findings into a decision-making tool could facilitate practitioner willingness to monitor sleep in athletes. Hypothesis: Key predictor variables, identified by feature reduction techniques, will lead to higher predictive accuracy in determining youth athletes with poor sleep quality. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A group (N = 115) of elite youth athletes completed questionnaires consisting of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questions on sport participation, training, sleep environment, and sleep hygiene habits. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used for feature reduction and to select factors to train a feature-reduced sleep quality classification model. These were compared with a classification model utilizing the full feature set. Results: Sport type, training before 8 am, training hours per week, presleep computer usage, presleep texting or calling, prebedtime reading, and during-sleep time checks on digital devices were identified as variables of greatest influence on sleep quality and used for the reduced feature set modeling. The reduced feature set model performed better (area under the curve, 0.80; sensitivity, 0.57; specificity, 0.80) than the full feature set models in classifying youth athlete sleep quality. Conclusion: The findings of our study highlight that sleep quality of elite youth athletes is best predicted by specific sport participation, training, and sleep hygiene habits. Clinical Relevance: Education and interventions around the training and sleep hygiene factors that were identified to most influence the sleep quality of youth athletes could be prioritized to optimize their sleep characteristics. The developed sleep quality nomogram may be useful as a decision-making tool to improve sleep monitoring practice among practitioners.},

Since their first use in the 1980s, CDSS have seen a rapid evolution. They are now commonly administered through electronic medical records and other computerized clinical workflows, which has been facilitated by increasing global adoption of electronic medical records with advanced capabilities. Despite these advances, there remain unknowns regarding the effect CDSS have on the providers who use them, patient outcomes, and costs. There have been numerous published examples in the past decade(s) of CDSS success stories, but notable setbacks have also shown us that CDSS are not without risks. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art overview on the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine, including the different types, current use cases with proven efficacy, common pitfalls, and potential harms. We conclude with evidence-based recommendations for minimizing risk in CDSS design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance.},

The training occurs in an interactive learning environment that enables completing sophisticated tasks in full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. During the training, the learning environment allows collecting data about trainees' interactions with the environment, such as their usage of command-line tools. These data contain patterns indicative of trainees' learning processes, and revealing them allows to assess the trainees and provide feedback to help them learn. However, automated analysis of these data is challenging. The training tasks feature complex problem-solving, and many different solution approaches are possible. Moreover, the trainees generate vast amounts of interaction data. This paper explores a dataset from 18 cybersecurity training sessions using data mining and machine learning techniques. We employed pattern mining and clustering to analyze 8834 commands collected from 113 trainees, revealing their typical behavior, mistakes, solution strategies, and difficult training stages. Pattern mining proved suitable in capturing timing information and tool usage frequency. Clustering underlined that many trainees often face the same issues, which can be addressed by targeted scaffolding. Our results show that data mining methods are suitable for analyzing cybersecurity training data. Educational researchers and practitioners can apply these methods in their contexts to assess trainees, support them, and improve the training design.

Results: We describe Barnacle, a production-grade analysis tool that detects such chimeras in de novo assemblies of RNA-seq data, and supports prioritizing them for review and validation by reporting the relative coverage of co-occurring chimeric and wild-type transcripts. We demonstrate applications in large-scale disease studies, by identifying PTDs in MLL, ITDs in FLT3, and reciprocal fusions between PML and RARA, in two deeply sequenced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq datasets. Conclusions: Our analyses of real and simulated data sets show that, with appropriate filter settings, Barnacle makes highly specific predictions for three types of chimeric transcripts that are important in a range of cancers: PTDs, ITDs, and fusions. High specificity makes manual review and validation efficient, which is necessary in large-scale disease studies. Characterizing an extended range of chimera types will help generate insights into progression, treatment, and outcomes for complex diseases.},

The statistics of a recent survey reports that the mortality rate is expanding due to obesity, cholesterol, high blood pressure and usage of tobacco among the people. The severity of the disease is piling up due to the above factors. Studying about the variations of these factors and their impact on CVD is the demand of the hour. This necessitates the usage of modern techniques to identify the disease at its outset and to aid a markdown in the mortality rate. Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining domains have a research scope with their enormous techniques that would assist in the prediction of the CVD priory and identify their behavioural patterns in the large volume of data. The results of these predictions will help the clinicians in decision making and early diagnosis, which would reduce the risk of patients becoming fatal. This paper compares and reports the various Classification, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning models that are used for prediction of the Cardio-Vascular diseases. The survey is organized as threefold: Classification and Data Mining Techniques for CVD, Machine Learning Models for CVD and Deep Learning Models for CVD prediction. The performance metrics used for reporting the accuracy, the dataset used for prediction and classification, and the tools used for each category of these techniques are also compiled and reported in this survey.

A more accurate and standardized analysis of the structure and morphology will enable clinical embryologists to select the most viable embryos for transfer and to use the best sperm for fertilization in ART programs. Despite the fact that many methods in this area still remain experimental and require further studies and improvement; these will be able to create the assisted systems implementing decision support. However, reproductive centers need the systems.

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is involved in 45-55\% of newly diagnosed cancer but also in the advanced stage disease thanks to the efficacy in the durable palliation and pain control. However, RT requires training and quality assurance[1]as it is a technologically complex advanced treatment[2]. To meet these needs, there will be an increased request of radiation therapy infrastructures and staffing but also the need to introduce Intelligence Artificial Guided Procedure (IAGP) and Automation in the clinical practice. The impact of this introduction will not be negligible, and it could improve overall health care quality thanks to the support of big data[3], deep learning[4], algorithmic innovation and powerful neural network models[5]. Automation using artificial intelligence is systematically involved in several fields of cancer care and, more specifically, in the radiation treatment workflow[6]. Many software aiming to improve and speed up the "contouring process" through autosegmentation[7]solutions have been released in the last years. Auto-segmentation also allows to perform the adaptive re-planning procedure during treatment[8]. Treatment planning step is also a very time-consuming task and the quality of its output is based on the physicist's and physician's knowledge and expertise. There is variability in this field, not only across centers, but even in the same center due to the presence of different planners. Inverse planning optimization and automated knowledge-based treatment planning approaches[9][10]improve the speed of the process and ensure that the quality of the results is optimal and not treatment planner dependent. Many AI applications have also been introduced in the radiation delivery process. Many technologies can indeed check the exact location of the target and the organs at risk improving the quality and speeding up the procedure of patient repositioning[11]and the radiation delivery[12]. Recently, Decision Support Systems (DSS) are spreading more and more: the implementation of large database andradiomics[13]provides physicians a huge amount of data that can improve clinical practice through the use of predictive models[14]and reduce the impact of knowledge gaps between domain-specific experts and non-experts[15]aiming to improve personalized cancer care. Aim of this talk is to present and discuss how the introduction of Intelligence Artificial Guided Procedure (IAGP) and Automation could impact the clinical practice and the radiotherapy workflow, especially in the fields of contouring and treatment planning, quality assurance, radiation delivery and clinical outcomes recording and prediction. It will be also analyzed how, thanks to the minimum human intervention and automatically error detection systems, automation could also provide a reduction in cure costs[16]and an escape from time-consuming repetitious tasks with significant advantages for the physicians and consequent of more time to dedicate to interaction with patients, increasing the level of humanity and patients care perception quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

  abstract = {Electronic healthcare technology is widespread around the world and creates massive potential to improve clinical outcomes and transform care delivery. However, there are increasing concerns with respect to the cyber vulnerabilities of medical tools, malicious medical errors, and security attacks on healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed the medical devices/systems and their communicating data to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Adversaries leverage the state-of-the-art technologies, in particular artificial intelligence and computer vision-based techniques, in order to launch stronger and more detrimental attacks on the medical targets. The medical domain is an attractive area for cybercrimes for two fundamental reasons: (a) it is rich resource of valuable and sensitive data; and (b) its protection and defensive mechanisms are weak and ineffective. The attacks aim to steal health information from the patients, manipulate the medical information and queries, maliciously change the medical diagnosis, decisions, and prescriptions, etc. A successful attack in the medical domain causes serious damage to the patient's health and even death. Therefore, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety and every aspect of the medical domain, while it has not been studied sufficiently. To tackle this problem, new human- and computer-based countermeasures are researched and proposed for medical attacks using the most effective software and hardware technologies, such as artificial intelligence and computer vision. This review provides insights to the novel and existing solutions in the literature that mitigate cyber risks, errors, damage, and threats in the medical domain. We have performed a scoping review analyzing the four major elements in this area (in order from a medical perspective): (1) medical errors; (2) security weaknesses of medical devices at software- and hardware-level; (3) artificial intelligence and/or computer vision in medical applications; and (4) cyber attacks and defenses in the medical domain. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and computer vision are key topics in this review and their usage in all these four elements are discussed. The review outcome delivers the solutions through building and evaluating the connections among these elements in order to serve as a beneficial guideline for medical electronic hardware security.},

  abstract = {Introduction Machine learning capability holds promise to inform disease models, the discovery and development of novel disease modifying therapeutics and prevention strategies in psychiatry. Herein, we provide an introduction on how machine learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) may instantiate such capabilities, as well as provide rationale for its application to psychiatry in both research and clinical ecosystems. Methods Databases PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from 1966 to June 2016 for keywords:Big Data, Machine Learning, Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Mental Health, Mental Disease, Psychiatry, Data Mining, RDoC, and Research Domain Criteria. Articles selected for review were those that were determined to be aligned with the objective of this particular paper. Results Results indicate that AI is a viable option to build useful predictors of outcome while offering objective and comparable accuracy metrics, a unique opportunity, particularly in mental health research. The approach has also consistently brought notable insight into disease models through processing the vast amount of already available multi-domain, semi-structured medical data. The opportunity for AI in psychiatry, in addition to disease-model refinement, is in characterizing those at risk, and it is likely also relevant to personalizing and discovering therapeutics. Conclusions Machine learning currently provides an opportunity to parse disease models in complex, multi-factorial disease states (e.g. mental disorders) and could possibly inform treatment selection with existing therapies and provide bases for domain-based therapeutic discovery.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease need to enroll patients whose cognition will decline over time, if left untreated, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of an intervention. Machine learning models used to screen for patients at risk of progression to dementia should therefore favor specificity (detecting only progressors) over sensitivity (detecting all progressors), especially when the prevalence of progressors is low. Here, we explore whether such high-risk patients can be identified using cognitive assessments and structural neuroimaging by training machine learning tools in a high-specificity regime. Results: A multimodal signature of Alzheimer's dementia was first extracted from the ADNI1 dataset. We then validated the predictive value of this signature on ADNI1 patients with mild cognitive impairment (N = 235). The signature was optimized to predict progression to dementia over 3 years with low sensitivity (55.1\%) but high specificity (95.6\%), resulting in only moderate accuracy (69.3\%) but high positive predictive value (80.4\%, adjusted for a "typical" 33\% prevalence rate of true progressors). These results were replicated in ADNI2 (N = 235), with 87.8\% adjusted positive predictive value (96.7\% specificity, 47.3\% sensitivity, 85.1\% accuracy). Conclusions: We found that cognitive measures alone could identify high-risk individuals, with structural measurements providing a slight improvement. The signature had comparable receiver operating characteristics to standard machine learning tools, yet a marked improvement in positive predictive value was achieved over the literature by selecting a high-specificity operating point. The multimodal signature can be readily applied for the enrichment of clinical trials.},

Strains resistant to available antibiotics pose a significant healthcare problem. The enormous complexity of the ribosome poses a barrier for drug discovery. We have overcome this in a tractable way by using an RNA segment that represents the peptidyl transferase center as a target. By using a novel combination of NMR transverse relaxation times (T-2) and computational chemistry approaches, we have obtained improved inhibitors of the Mtb ribosomal PTC. Two phenylthiazole derivatives were predicted by machine learning models as effective inhibitors, and this was confirmed by their IC50 values, which were significantly improved over standard antibiotic drugs.},

While several pathogenic mutations have been identified, the vast majority of ALS cases have no family history of disease. Thus, for most ALS cases, the disease may be a product of multiple pathways contributing to varying degrees in each patient. Using machine learning algorithms, we stratify the transcriptomes of 148 ALS postmortem cortex samples into three distinct molecular subtypes. The largest cluster, identified in 61\% of patient samples, displays hallmarks of oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Another 19\% of the samples shows predominant signatures of glial activation. Finally, a third group (20\%) exhibits high levels of retrotransposon expression and signatures of TARDBP/TDP-43 dysfunction. We further demonstrate that TDP-43 (1) directly binds a subset of retrotransposon transcripts and contributes to their silencing in vitro, and (2) pathological TDP-43 aggregation correlates with retrotransposon de-silencing in vivo.},

  abstract = {Bearing spall detection and predicting its size are great challenges. Model-based simulation is a well-known traditional approach to physically model the influence of the spall on the bearing. Building a physical model is challenging due to the bearing complexity and the expert knowledge required to build such a model. Obviously, building a partial physical model for some of the spall sizes is easier. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning algorithm, called Probability-Based Forest, that uses a partial physical model. First, the behavior of some of the spall sizes is physically modeled and a simulator based on this model generates scenarios for these spall sizes in different conditions. Then, the machine-learning algorithm trains these scenarios to generate a prediction model of spall sizes even for those that have not been modeled by the physical model. Feature extraction is a key factor in the success of this approach. We extract features using two traditional approaches: statistical and physical, and an additional new approach: Time Series FeatuRe Extraction based on Scalable Hypothesis tests (TSFRESH). Experimental evaluation with well-known physical model shows that our approach achieves high accuracy, even in cases that have not been modeled by the physical model. Also, we show that the TSFRESH feature-extraction approach achieves the highest accuracy.},

The sensor consists in a custom non-intrusive, compact, and easy-to-install 32-channel high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) electrode array, built on a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) to allow wrapping around the forearm. The sensor provides a low-noise digitization interface with wireless data transmission through an industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio link. An original frequency-time-space cross-domain preprocessing method is proposed to enhance gesture-specific data homogeneity and generate reliable muscle activation maps, leading to 98.15\% accuracy when using a majority vote over 5 subsequent inferences by the proposed CNN. The obtained real-time gesture recognition, within 100 to 200 ms, and CNN properties show reliable and promising results to improve on the state-of-the-art of commercial hand prostheses. Moreover, edge computing using a specialized embedded artificial intelligence (AI) platform ensures reliable, secure and low latency real-time operation as well as quick and easy access to training, fine-tuning and calibration of the neural network. Co-design of the signal processing, AI algorithms and sensing hardware ensures a reliable and power-efficient embedded gesture recognition system.},

  abstract = {Objective: Refeeding is the cornerstone of anorexia nervosa (AN) treatment, but little is known regarding the optimal pace and dietary composition or possible adverse effects of current clinical practices. Plasma lipids may be a moderating factor underlying unfavorable refeeding effects in AN, such as an abnormal central body fat distribution. The objective of this study was to analyze the plasma lipidome in the acutely underweight state of AN before and after refeeding. Method: Using high-throughput quantitative mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics, we measured 13 lipid classes and 204 lipid species or subspecies in the plasma of young female patients with acute AN, before (n = 39) and after (n = 23) short-term weight restoration during an intensive inpatient refeeding program (median body mass index [BMI] increase = 26.4\%), in comparison to those in healthy control participants (n = 37). Results: Before inpatient treatment, patients with AN exhibited increased concentrations of cholesterol and several other lipid classes. After refeeding, multiple lipid classes including cholesterol and ceramides, as well as certain ceramide species previously associated with obesity or overfeeding, showed increased concentrations, and a pattern of shorter and more saturated triacylgycerides emerged. A machine learning model trained to predict BMI based on the lipidomic profiles revealed a sizable overprediction in patients with AN after weight restoration. Conclusion: The results point toward a profound lipid dysregulation with similarities to obesity and other features of the metabolic syndrome after short-term weight restoration. Thus, this study provides evidence for possible short-term adverse effects of current refeeding practices on the metabolic state and should inspire more research on nutritional interventions in AN.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset of 400 CXRs including 200 difficult lung cancer cases was curated. Examinations were reviewed by three FRCR radiologists and an AI algorithm to establish performance in tumour identification. AI and radiologist labels were combined retrospectively to simulate the proposed AI triage workflow. RESULTS: When used as a standalone algorithm, AI classification was equivalent to the average radiologist performance. The best overall performances were achieved when AI was combined with radiologists, with an average reduction of missed cancers of 60\%. Combination with AI also standardised the performance of radiologists. The greatest improvements were observed when common sources of errors were present, such as distracting findings. DISCUSSION: The proposed AI implementation pathway stands to reduce radiologist errors and improve clinician reporting performance. Furthermore, taking a radiologist-centric approach in the development of clinical AI holds promise for catching systematically missed lung cancers. This represents a tremendous opportunity to improve patient outcomes for lung cancer diagnosis. (C) 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background A key issue to Alzheimer's disease clinical trial failures is poor participant selection. Participants have heterogeneous cognitive trajectories and many do not decline during trials, which reduces a study's power to detect treatment effects. Trials need enrichment strategies to enroll individuals who are more likely to decline. Objectives To develop machine learning models to predict cognitive trajectories in participants with early Alzheimer's disease and presymptomatic individuals over 24 and 48 months respectively. Design Prognostic machine learning models were trained from a combination of demographics, cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data. Setting Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3), PharmaCog, and a Phase 3 clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease were used for this study. Participants A total of 2098 participants who had demographics, cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data, as well as follow-up visits for 24-48 months were included. Measurements Baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, demographics, and APOE genotype were used to separate decliners, defined as individuals whose CDR-Sum of Boxes scores increased during a predefined time window, from stable individuals. A prognostic model to predict decline at 24 months in early Alzheimer's disease was trained on 1151 individuals who had baseline diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia from ADNI and NACC. This model was validated on 115 individuals from a placebo arm of a Phase 3 clinical trial and 76 individuals from the PharmaCog dataset. A second prognostic model to predict decline at 48 months in presymptomatic populations was trained on 628 individuals from ADNI and NACC who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline. This model was validated on 128 individuals from OASIS-3. Results The models achieved up to 79\% area under the curve (cross-validated and out-of-sample). Power analyses showed that using prognostic models to recruit enriched cohorts of predicted decliners can reduce clinical trial sample sizes by as much as 51\% while maintaining the same detection power. Conclusions Prognostic tools for predicting cognitive decline and enriching clinical trials with participants at the highest risk of decline can improve trial quality, derisk endpoint failures, and accelerate therapeutic development in Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in treating OSA is to achieve adequate CPAP adherence. Telemonitoring has the potential to provide individualized management and early recognition of problems during treatment. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of a multimodal telemonitoring intervention on treatment adherence, quality of life, and functional status in symptomatic patients with OSA and low cardiovascular risk? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, patients newly diagnosed with OSA were randomly assigned to multimodal telemonitoring for 6 months vs usual care (UC). Telemonitoring consisted of built-in electronic alert algorithms for early adjustment of CPAP treatment in case of side effects, leaks, or persistent residual events. The primary outcome was CPAP adherence (in hours per night). Secondary outcomes included daily symptoms such as fatigue and sleepiness, and quality of life measured by using self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with OSA and a median age of 50.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 42.1; 58.1 years) were included in the study; they were predominantly male (63\%) with a median BMI of 30.6 kg/m (2) (IQR, 26.8; 35.1 kg/m (2)) and a median apnea-hypopnea index of 45.2 events/h (IQR, 34.0; 60.0 events/h). Of these, 102 received UC and 104 received telemonitoring. After 6 months of treatment, CPAP adherence was similar in the two groups when assessed either by mean duration of usage (4.73 +/- 2.48 h per night in the telemonitoring group and 5.08 +/- 2.44 h per night in the UC group; P = .30) or in percentage of patients adherent to treatment ({$>$} 4 h usage per night, {$>$} 70\% nights; 64\% in the telemonitoring group vs 72\% in the UC group; P = .24). There was no significant difference between the groups in effect size of improvement in fatigue and sleepiness. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe OSA and low cardiovascular risk, multimodal telemonitoring did not increase CPAP adherence. For both the telemonitoring and UC groups, similar improvements in daytime symptoms were achieved.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical industry promises many benefits, so AI has been introduced to medical practice primarily in developed countries. In Japan, the government is preparing for the rollout of AI in the medical industry. This rollout depends on doctors and the public accepting the technology. Therefore it is necessary to consider acceptance among doctors and among the public. However, little is known about the acceptance of AI in medicine in Japan. Objective: This study aimed to obtain detailed data on the acceptance of AI in medicine by comparing the acceptance among Japanese doctors with that among the Japanese public. Methods: We conducted an online survey, and the responses of doctors and members of the public were compared. AI in medicine was defined as the use of AI to determine diagnosis and treatment without requiring a doctor. A questionnaire was prepared referred to as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a model of behavior toward new technologies. It comprises 20 items, and each item was rated on a five-point scale. Using this questionnaire, we conducted an online survey in 2018 among 399 doctors and 600 members of the public. The sample-wide responses were analyzed, and then the responses of the doctors were compared with those of the public using t tests. Results: Regarding the sample-wide responses (N=999), 653 (65.4\%) of the respondents believed, in the future, AI in medicine would be necessary, whereas only 447 (44.7\%) expressed an intention to use AI-driven medicine. Additionally, 730 (73.1\%) believed that regulatory legislation was necessary, and 734 (73.5\%) were concerned about where accountability lies. Regarding the comparison between doctors and the public, doctors (mean 3.43, SD 1.00) were more likely than members of the public (mean 3.23, SD 0.92) to express intention to use AI-driven medicine (P\&lt;.001), suggesting that optimism about AI in medicine is greater among doctors compared to the public. Conclusions: Many of the respondents were optimistic about the role of AI in medicine. However, when asked whether they would like to use AI-driven medicine, they tended to give a negative response. This trend suggests that concerns about the lack of regulation and about accountability hindered acceptance. Additionally, the results revealed that doctors were more enthusiastic than members of the public regarding AI-driven medicine. For the successful implementation of AI in medicine, it would be necessary to inform the public and doctors about the relevant laws and to take measures to remove their concerns about them.},

  abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{$<$}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{$<$}.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance–based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31\% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P{$<$}.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to an implementation phase in many fields, including medicine. The combination of improved availability of large datasets, increasing computing power, and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5 years, AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition, caption generation, and speech recognition. Radiology, in particular, is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality, value, and depth of radiology's contribution to patient care and population health, and will revolutionize radiologists' workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice, policy, and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology, educational needs of members, research and development, partnerships, potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of radiologists, and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birthweight is an important indicator during the fetal development process to protect the maternal and infant safety. However, birthweight is difficult to be directly measured, and is usually roughly estimated by the empirical formulas according to the experience of the doctors in clinical practice., METHODS: This study attempts to combine multiple electronic medical records with the B-ultrasonic examination of pregnant women to construct a hybrid birth weight predicting classifier based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The clinical data were collected from 5,759 Chinese pregnant women who have given birth, with more than 57,000 obstetric electronic medical records. We evaluated the prediction by the mean relative error (MRE) and the accuracy rate of different machine learning classifiers at different predicting periods for first delivery and multiple deliveries. Additionally, we evaluated the classification accuracies of different classifiers respectively for the Small-for-Gestational-age (SGA), Large-for-Gestational-Age (LGA) and Appropriate-for-Gestational-Age (AGA) groups., RESULTS: The results show that the accuracy rate of the prediction model using Convolutional Neuron Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear-Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Back Propagation Neural Network(BPNN), and the proposed hybrid-LSTM at the 40th pregnancy week for first delivery were 0.498, 0.662, 0.670, 0.680, 0.705 and 0.793, respectively. Among the groups of less than 39th pregnancy week, the 39th pregnancy week and more than 40th week, the hybrid-LSTM model obtained the best accuracy and almost the least MRE compared with those of machine learning models. Not surprisingly, all the machine learning models performed better than the empirical formula. In the SGA, LGA and AGA group experiments, the average accuracy by the empirical formula, logistic regression (LR), BPNN, CNN, RF and Hybrid-LSTM were 0.780, 0.855, 0.890, 0.906, 0.916 and 0.933, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are helpful for the birthweight prediction and development of guidelines for clinical delivery treatments. It is also useful for the implementation of a decision support system using the temporal machine learning prediction model, as it can assist the clinicians to make correct decisions during the obstetric examinations and remind pregnant women to manage their weight.},

  abstract = {Current research on solar chimneys has focused on developing regression-based empirical models, which might not be correct enough compared to the soft computing tools i.e., techniques of artificial intelligence. Current research has also published the search algorithm-based single-objective optimization of solar chimneys, whereas the latest genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization can be more useful for decision-making purposes. Current research has also not focused on the macro or global impact of the usage of solar chimneys in context with the energy, economic, environmental, social, and political framework of the world. This research fills these gaps by the development of a digital twin model of the solar chimney using a multivariate regression model based on the least square method and an artificial intelligence (AI) method based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and their comparison. A multiobjective optimization study along with the application of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to optimize the geometric dimensions of the solar chimney considering four different climatic zones using an elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to maximize the number of air changes per hour, energy efficiency, and specific environmental influence. The results have shown that the statistical performance indicators like the coefficient of regression, etc., are higher for the MLP-ANN technique as compared to the multivariate regression method, thus, the AI technique is preferred. Comparison of optimization results with the base case condition has shown that the number of air changes can be improved between similar to 71\% and 87\%. The global projection has demonstrated that the integration of solar chimneys in low-income countries with high air conditioners installation rates must be necessary. It is also recommended to use solar chimneys in high income countries for the renovation of the existing built environment to decrease the energy intensity of the building sector.},

  abstract = {The affective content of a movie is often considered to be largely determined by its style and aesthetics. Recently, studies have attempted to estimate affective movie content with computational features, but results have been mixed, one of the main reasons being a lack of data on perceptual stylistic and aesthetic attributes of film, which would provide a ground truth for the features. The distinctions between energetic and tense arousal as well as perceived and felt affect are also often neglected. In this study, we present a data set of ratings by 73 viewers of 83 stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes for a selection of movie clips containing complete scenes taken from mainstream movies. The affective attributes include the temporal progression of perceived and felt valence and arousal within the clips. The data set is aimed to be used to train algorithms that predict viewer assessments based on low-level computational features. With this data set, we performed a baseline study modeling the relation between a large selection of low-level computational features (i.e., visual, auditory, and temporal) and perceptual stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes of movie clips. Two algorithms were compared in a realistic prediction scenario: linear regression and the neural-network-based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Felt and perceived affect as well as stylistic attributes were shown to be equally easy to predict, whereas the prediction of aesthetic attributes failed. The performance of the ELM predictor was overall found to be slightly better than the linear regression. A feature selection experiment illustrated that features from all low-level computational modalities, visual, auditory and temporal, contribute to the prediction of the affect assessments. We have made our assessment data and extracted computational features publicly available.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Infobuttons are clinical decision tools embedded in the electronic health record that attempt to link clinical data with context sensitive knowledge resources. We systematically reviewed technical approaches that contribute to improved infobutton design, implementation and functionality., METHODS: We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from inception to March 1, 2016 for studies describing the use of infobuttons. We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability., RESULTS: We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians' information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations., CONCLUSION: Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage. Further research is needed to investigate user experience improvements to increase infobutton use and effectiveness. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach to understanding and automating goal-directed learning and decision-making. It is designed for problems which include a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. For example, blood glucose (BG) control in diabetes mellitus (DM), where the learning agent and its environment are the controller and the body of the patient respectively. RL algorithms could be used to design a fully closed-loop controller, providing a truly personalized insulin dosage regimen based exclusively on the patient's own data. Objective(s): In this review we aim to evaluate state-of-the-art RL approaches to designing BG control algorithms in DM patients, reporting successfully implemented RL algorithms in closed-loop, insulin infusion, decision support and personalized feedback in the context of DM. Method(s): An exhaustive literature search was performed using different online databases, analyzing the literature from 1990 to 2019. In a first stage, a set of selection criteria were established in order to select the most relevant papers according to the title, keywords and abstract. Research questions were established and answered in a second stage, using the information extracted from the articles selected during the preliminary selection. Result(s): The initial search using title, keywords, and abstracts resulted in a total of 404 articles. After removal of duplicates from the record, 347 articles remained. An independent analysis and screening of the records against our inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Methods section resulted in removal of 296 articles, leaving 51 relevant articles. A full-text assessment was conducted on the remaining relevant articles, which resulted in 29 relevant articles that were critically analyzed. The inter-rater agreement was measured using Cohen Kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Conclusion(s): The advances in health technologies and mobile devices have facilitated the implementation of RL algorithms for optimal glycemic regulation in diabetes. However, there exists few articles in the literature focused on the application of these algorithms to the BG regulation problem. Moreover, such algorithms are designed for control tasks as BG adjustment and their use have increased recently in the diabetes research area, therefore we foresee RL algorithms will be used more frequently for BG control in the coming years. Furthermore, in the literature there is a lack of focus on aspects that influence BG level such as meal intakes and physical activity (PA), which should be included in the control problem. Finally, there exists a need to perform clinical validation of the algorithms.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early detection and efficient management of sepsis are important for improving health care quality, effectiveness, and costs. Due to its high cost and prevalence, sepsis is a major focus area across institutions and many studies have emerged over the past years with different models or novel machine learning techniques in early detection of sepsis or potential mortality associated with sepsis., OBJECTIVE: To understand predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients, either in early detection of onset or mortality., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematized narrative review and identified common and unique characteristics between their approaches and results in studies that used predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients. After reviewing 148 retrieved papers, a total of 31 qualifying papers were analyzed with variances in model, including linear regression (n = 2), logistic regression (n = 5), support vector machines (n = 4), and Markov models (n = 4), as well as population (range: 24-198,833) and feature size (range: 2-285). Many of the studies used local data sets of varying sizes and locations while others used the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data. Additionally, vital signs or laboratory test results were commonly used as features for training and testing purposes; however, a few used more unique features including gene expression data from blood plasma and unstructured text and data from clinician notes., CONCLUSION: Overall, we found variation in the domain of predictive analytics tools for septic patients, from feature and population size to choice of method or algorithm. There are still limitations in transferability and generalizability of the algorithms or methods used. However, it is evident that implementing predictive analytics tools are beneficial in the early detection of sepsis or death related to sepsis. Since most of these studies were retrospective, the translational value in the real-world setting in different wards should be further investigated. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Therefore, time-efficient ASD screening is imperative to help health professionals and to inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. We propose new machine learning framework related to autism screening of adults and adolescents that contain vital features and perform predictive analysis using logistic regression to reveal important information related to autism screening. We also perform an in-depth feature analysis on the two datasets using information gain (IG) and Chi square testing (CHI) to determine the influential features that can be utilized in screening for autism.

  abstract = {Digitalization, especially the use of machine learning and computational intelligence, is considered to dramatically shape medical procedures in the near future. In the field of cancer diagnostics, radiomics, the extraction of multiple quantitative image features and their clustered analysis, is gaining increasing attention to obtain more detailed, reproducible, and meaningful information about the disease entity, its prognosis and the ideal therapeutic option. In this context, automation of diagnostic procedures can improve the entire pipeline, which comprises patient registration, planning and performing an imaging examination at the scanner, image reconstruction, image analysis, and feeding the diagnostic information from various sources into decision support systems. With a focus on cancer diagnostics, this review article reports and discusses how computer-assistance can be integrated into diagnostic procedures and which benefits and challenges arise from it. Besides a strong view on classical imaging modalities like x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET, SPECT and hybrid imaging devices thereof, it is outlined how imaging data can be combined with data deriving from patient anamnesis, clinical chemistry, pathology, and different omics. In this context, the article also discusses IT infrastructures that are required to realize this integration in the clinical routine. Although there are still many challenges to comprehensively implement automated and integrated data analysis in molecular cancer imaging, the authors conclude that we are entering a new era of medical diagnostics and precision medicine.

  abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

New strategies are required to realise their potential. Aims To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people with depression and anxiety. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7). Results Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58\% vs. 35\%), and improved outcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms. Conclusions The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails facilitated outcomes. Further attention to strategies that facilitate adherence, learning, and safety will help realise the potential of self-guided interventions.

This study found the intervention resulted in significant symptom reductions. It also found that automated emails increased treatment completion and clinical improvements in a subsample with elevated anxiety and depression. Aims To examine the clinical outcomes and the effect of automated emails at 12 months post-treatment. Method Participants, who were randomly allocated to a Treatment Plus Automated Emails Group (TEG; n = 100), a standard Treatment Group (TG; n = 106) or delayed-treatment Waitlist Control Group (Control; n = 51), were followed up at 12 months post-treatment. Eighty-one percent, 78\% and 87\% of participants in the TEG, TG and treated Waitlist Control Group provided symptom data at 12-month follow-up, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (GAD-7). Results Significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed over time in both the TEG and TG (Fs {$>$}69, ps {$<$}.001) these were sustained from post-treatment to 12-month follow-up (ps {$>$}.05), and were associated with large effect sizes. No statistically significant differences in symptoms were found between the TEG and TG at post-treatment, 3-month or 12-month follow-up. Previously reported symptom differences between TEG and TG participants with comorbid symptoms were no longer present at 12-month follow-up (ps {$>$}.70). Conclusions The overall benefits of the Wellbeing Course were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Although automated emails facilitated Course completion and reductions in symptoms for participants with comorbid anxiety and depression from pre-post treatment, these differences were no longer observed at 12-month follow-up. The results indicate that automated emails promote more rapid treatment response for people with elevated and comorbid symptoms, but may not improve longer term outcomes.

  abstract = {Mental illness issues are a very common health issue in youths and adults across the world. The usage of real-time data analytics in health care has a great potential to improve and enhance the quality of health care services, including diagnosis and medical prescription. Stress is one of the major health issues these days, which leads to many acute and sometimes incurable diseases to the students of very young age. Stress affects physiological parameters of the human body; due to these, human emotions may also change. This research paper proposes a hybrid model for pervasive stress detection, which deals with imbalance class problems using real-time data analytics and Internet of Things and it also presents a new stress analysis system to detect stressful conditions of the student, and to diagnose whether they are stressed or relaxed by using a designed set of experimental tasks. Regular monitoring of students'/professionals' health, including measurement of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, provides a good understanding of their stress level. Data are acquired by using GSR and ECG sensors for 34 participants while undertaking five different tasks discussed in the proposed experiment. The graphical relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance across various experimental activities highlights the fact as to how physiological parameters of the human body get affected along with the mental status of the students. This article performs accuracy computation by using different machine-learning models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Bagging Classifiers (BAG), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) followed by tuning with the best set of hyper parameters for each model. The proposed hybrid classification model deals with the class imbalance problem by using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. The shrewd ANN-based hybrid model achieves 99.4\% accuracy on the self-generated dataset for the mental state classification of the students, which is best among other classifiers such as LR, SVM, KNN, BAG, RF, GB, and ANN. The prediction result of all 34 participants of the experiment is also classified into four categories: relaxed, stressed, partially stressed, and happy.},

  abstract = {Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), especially fuzzy MCDM process, is the most suitable approach for evaluating strategic decisions. However, in most cases, the Type-1 fuzzy form is insufficient for addressing uncertainty. The Type-2 fuzzy set is a more powerful tool for characterizing uncertainty in complex problems for several domains. The symmetric shape of Gaussian functions better fits most real cases. In many areas, this Gaussian feature serves to describe complex situations in terms of knowledge representation and to resolve critical decision problems. Therefore, a wide usage of Gaussian Type-2 fuzzy sets is expected; however, because of their complexity, very few studies can be found in the literature. The details of Type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets have not been thoroughly studied. The foundation of interval-valued Type-2 (IT2) Gaussian fuzzy sets with finite ranges, which are called Finite Interval Type-2 (FIT2) Gaussian fuzzy numbers, is proposed in this study. Then, arithmetic operations on FIT2 Gaussian fuzzy numbers and a ranking procedure are derived and adapted to the strategic selection process. The extended TODIM method with FIT2 Gaussian fuzzy numbers is integrated into a real economic evaluation of a medical device selection problem. This problem is detailed with technical and economical criteria. In this study, a healthcare device selection problem is analyzed from the perspectives of clinicians, biomedical engineers, and healthcare investors. The case study is characterized through an evaluation process in which different experts' perspectives are considered. Finally, a comparison of the results derived from different multi-criteria solution processes is presented.},

  abstract = {Prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval increases the risk for torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially fatal arrhythmia. The likelihood of TdP is higher in patients with risk factors that include female sex, older age, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, concomitant administration of two or more QTc interval-prolonging medications, among others. Assessment and quantification of risk factors may facilitate prediction of patients at highest risk for developing QTc interval prolongation and TdP. Investigators have utilized the field of predictive analytics, which generates predictions using techniques including data mining, modeling, machine learning, and others, to develop methods of risk quantification and prediction of QTc interval prolongation. Predictive analytics have also been incorporated into clinical decision support (CDS) tools to alert clinicians regarding patients at increased risk of developing QTc interval prolongation. The objectives of this article are to assess the effectiveness of predictive analytics for identification of patients at risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and to discuss the efficacy of incorporation of predictive analytics into CDS tools in clinical practice. A systematic review of English-language articles (human subjects only) was performed, yielding 57 articles, with an additional 4 articles identified from other sources; a total of 10 articles were included in this review. Risk scores for QTc interval prolongation have been developed in various patient populations including those in cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) and in broader populations of hospitalized or health system patients. One group developed a risk score that includes information regarding genetic polymorphisms; this score significantly predicted TdP. Development of QTc interval prolongation risk prediction models and incorporation of these models into CDS tools reduce the risk of QTc interval prolongation in cardiac ICUs and identify health system patients at increased risk for mortality. The impact of these QTc interval prolongation predictive analytics on overall patient safety outcomes, such as TdP and sudden cardiac death relative to the cost of development and implementation, requires further study.

This paper tries to understand why formal function modeling is not practically utilized in industry by analyzing usage cases of function. By observing product development activities in industry, the paper identifies three problems that prevent formal function modeling from wider applications in practices, namely, practitioners' neglect of function modeling, the lack of practically useful function reasoning, and the complexity of the methods and tools of formal function modeling that make them impractical. Finally, the paper proposes strategies to tackle these problems and illustrates some research efforts in this regard.},

Logistic regression (odds ratios, OR) to model the predictors of trust in robot-assisted surgery was calculated through motivational factors, using experience and sociodemographic independent variables. (3) Results: The results obtained indicate that, as the experience of using robots increases, the predictive coefficients related to information, attitude, and perception of robots become more negative. Furthermore, sociodemographic variables played an important predictive role. The effect of experience on trust in robots for surgical interventions was greater among men, people between 40 and 54 years old, and those with higher educational levels.

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the global trends, patterns, and development of interdisciplinary landscapes in AI and cancer research. Methods: An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify research domains emerging from abstract contents. The Jaccard similarity index was utilized to identify the most frequently co-occurring terms. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for classifying papers into corresponding topics. Results: From 1991 to 2018, the number of studies examining the application of AI in cancer care has grown to 3555 papers covering therapeutics, capacities, and factors associated with outcomes. Topics with the highest volume of publications include (1) machine learning, (2) comparative effectiveness evaluation of AI-assisted medical therapies, and (3) AI-based prediction. Noticeably, this classification has revealed topics examining the incremental effectiveness of AI applications, the quality of life, and functioning of patients receiving these innovations. The growing research productivity and expansion of multidisciplinary approaches are largely driven by machine learning, artificial neural networks, and AI in various clinical practices. Conclusions: The research landscapes show that the development of AI in cancer care is focused on not only improving prediction in cancer screening and AI-assisted therapeutics but also on improving other corresponding areas such as precision and personalized medicine and patient-reported outcomes.},

Methods: We obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape. Results: The applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources. Conclusions: The application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is the primary cause of burn-related mortality and morbidity. Traditional indicators of sepsis exhibit poor performance when used in this unique population due to their underlying hypermetabolic and inflammatory response following burn injury. To address this challenge, we developed the Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer (MILO), an automated machine learning (ML) platform, to automatically produce ML models for predicting burn sepsis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 211 adult patients (age {$>$}= 18 years) with severe burn injury ({$>$}= 20\% total body surface area) to generate training and test datasets for ML applications. The MILO approach was compared against an exhaustive "non-automated" ML approach as well as standard statistical methods. For this study, traditional multivariate logistic regression (LR) identified seven predictors of burn sepsis when controlled for age and burn size (OR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.99-4.04, P=0.032). The area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) when using these seven predictors was 0.88. Next, the non-automated ML approach produced an optimal model based on LR using 16 out of the 23 features from the study dataset. Model accuracy was 86\% with ROC-AUC of 0.96. In contrast, MILO identified a k-nearest neighbor-based model using only five features to be the best performer with an accuracy of 90\% and a ROC-AUC of 0.96. Machine learning augments burn sepsis prediction. MILO identified models more quickly, with less required features, and found to be analytically superior to traditional ML approaches. Future studies are needed to clinically validate the performance of MILO-derived ML models for sepsis prediction.},

  abstract = {Groundwater salinization is considered as a major environmental problem in worldwide coastal areas, influencing ecosystems and human health. However, an accurate prediction of salinity concentration in groundwater remains a challenge due to the complexity of groundwater salinization processes and its influencing factors. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting groundwater salinity and identify its influencing factors. We conducted a study for the coastal multi-layer aquifers of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam), using a geodatabase of 216 groundwater samples and 14 conditioning factors. We compared the predictive performances of different ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest Regression (RFR), the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), the CatBoost Regression (CBR), and the Light Gradient Boosting Regression (LGBR) models. The model performance was assessed by using root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results show that the CBR model has the highest performance with both training (R-2 = 0.999, RMSE = 29.90) and testing datasets (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 205.96, AIC = 720.60, and BIC = 751.04). Ten of the 14 influencing factors, including the distance to saline sources, the depth of screen well, the groundwater level, the vertical hydraulic conductivity, the operation time, the well density, the extraction capacity, the thickness of the aquitard, the distance to fault, and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors for groundwater salinity prediction. The results provide insights for policymakers in proposing remediation and management strategies for groundwater salinity issues in the context of excessive groundwater exploitation in coastal lowland regions. Since the human-induced influencing factors have significantly influenced groundwater salinization, urgent actions should be taken into consideration to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the coastal areas of the Mekong River Delta.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are a host of emergent technologies with the potential to improve hospital care in low- and middle-income countries such as Vietnam. Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence-based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government's requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability., OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals., METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Thu Vien Phap Luat, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step., RESULTS: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians' performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system's capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks., CONCLUSIONS: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting.

  abstract = {Background: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. Objective: We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a patient has based on the short textual description of patient’s history of present illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation note. Materials and methods: We clean and process the 1000 records made available through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). Results: Our CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best overall mean micro-F score of 63.144\% for 11 common mental conditions with statistically significant gains (p{$<$}0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904\% mean micro-F1 score. Both models’ improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular prediction for each instance. Conclusions: Although the history of present illness is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis.},

  abstract = {Patents are a type of intellectual property with ownership and monopolistic rights that are publicly accessible published documents, often with illustrations, registered by governments and international organizations. The registration allows people familiar with the domain to understand how to re-create the new and useful invention but restricts the manufacturing unless the owner licenses or enters into a legal agreement to sell ownership of the patent. Patents reward the costly research and development efforts of inventors while spreading new knowledge and accelerating innovation. This research uses artificial intelligence natural language processing, deep learning techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract the essential knowledge of patent documents within a given domain as a means to evaluate their worth and technical advantage. Manual patent abstraction is a time consuming, labor intensive, and subjective process which becomes cost and outcome ineffective as the size of the patent knowledge domain increases. This research develops an intelligent patent summarization methodology using artificial intelligence machine learning approaches to allow patent domains of extremely large sizes to be effectively and objectively summarized, especially for cases where the cost and time requirements of manual summarization is infeasible. The system learns to automatically summarize patent documents with natural language texts for any given technical domain. The machine learning solution identifies technical key terminologies (words, phrases, and sentences) in the context of the semantic relationships among training patents and corresponding summaries as the core of the summarization system. To ensure the high performance of the proposed methodology, ROUGE metrics are used to evaluate precision, recall, accuracy, and consistency of knowledge generated by the summarization system. The Smart machinery technologies domain, under the subdomains of control intelligence, sensor intelligence and intelligent decision-making provide the case studies for the patent summarization system training. The cases use 1708 training pairs of patents and summaries while testing uses 30 randomly selected patents. The case implementation and verification have shown the summary reports achieve 90\% and 84\% average precision and recall ratios respectively.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat depression, but the rates, timing, and baseline predictors of remission in “real world” patients are not established. The authors’ primary objectives in this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of citalopram, an SSRI, using measurement-based care in actual practice, and to identify predictors of symptom remission in outpatients with major depressive disorder. METHOD: This clinical study included outpatients with major depressive disorder who were treated in 23 psychiatric and 18 primary care “real world” settings. The patients received flexible doses of citalopram prescribed by clinicians for up to 14 weeks. The clinicians were assisted by a clinical research coordinator in the application of measurement-based care, which included the routine measurement of symptoms and side effects at each treatment visit and the use of a treatment manual that described when and how to modify medication doses based on these measures. Remission was defined as an exit score of ≤7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (primary outcome) or a score of ≤5 on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) (secondary outcome). Response was defined as a reduction of ≥50\% in baseline QIDS-SR score. RESULTS: Nearly 80\% of the 2,876 outpatients in the analyzed sample had chronic or recurrent major depression; most also had a number of comorbid general medical and psychiatric conditions. The mean exit citalopram dose was 41.8 mg/day. Remission rates were 28\% (HAM-D) and 33\% (QIDS-SR). The response rate was 47\% (QIDS-SR). Patients in primary and psychiatric care settings did not differ in remission or response rates. A substantial portion of participants who achieved either response or remission at study exit did so at or after 8 weeks of treatment. Participants who were Caucasian, female, employed, or had higher levels of education or income had higher HAM-D remission rates; longer index episodes, more concurrent psychiatric disorders (especially anxiety disorders or drug abuse), more general medical disorders, and lower baseline function and quality of life were associated with lower HAM-D remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: The response and remission rates in this highly generalizable sample with substantial axis I and axis III comorbidity closely resemble those seen in 8-week efficacy trials. The systematic use of easily implemented measurement-based care procedures may have assisted in achieving these results.},

  abstract = {Background: Besides anti-inflammatory medication, physical exercise represents a cornerstone of modern treatment for patients with axial spondyloarthritis (AS). Digital health apps (DHAs) such as the yoga app YogiTherapy could remotely empower patients to autonomously and correctly perform exercises. Objective: This study aimed to design and develop a smartphone-based app, YogiTherapy, for patients with AS. To gain additional insights into the usability of the graphical user interface (GUI) for further development of the app, this study focused exclusively on evaluating users' interaction with the GUI. Methods: The development of the app and the user experience study took place between October 2020 and March 2021. The DHA was designed by engineering students, rheumatologists, and patients with AS. After the initial development process, a pilot version of the app was evaluated by 5 patients and 5 rheumatologists. The participants had to interact with the app's GUI and complete 5 navigation tasks within the app. Subsequently, the completion rate and experience questionnaire (attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty) were completed by the patients. Results: The results of the posttest questionnaires showed that most patients were already familiar with digital apps (4/5, 80\%). The task completion rates of the usability test were 100\% (5/5) for the tasks T1 and T2, which included selecting and starting a yoga lesson and navigating to an information page. Rheumatologists indicated that they were even more experienced with digital devices (2/5, 40\% experts; 3/5, 60\% intermediates). In this case, they scored task completion rates of 100\% (5/5) for all 5 usability tasks T1 to T5. The mean results from the User Experience Questionnaire range from -3 (most negative) to +3 (most positive). According to rheumatologists' evaluations, attractiveness (mean 2.267, SD 0.401) and stimulation (mean 2.250, SD 0.354) achieved the best mean results compared with dependability (mean 2.000, SD 0.395). Patients rated attractiveness at a mean of 2.167 (SD 0.565) and stimulation at a mean of 1.950 (SD 0.873). The lowest mean score was reported for perspicuity (mean 1.250, SD 1.425). Conclusions: The newly developed and tested DHA YogiTherapy demonstrated moderate usability among rheumatologists and patients with rheumatic diseases. The app can be used by patients with AS as a complementary treatment. The initial evaluation of the GUI identified significant usability problems that need to be addressed before the start of a clinical evaluation. Prospective trials are also needed in the second step to prove the clinical benefits of the app.},

The technology acceptance model (TAM) concept was used to explore learning effectiveness and satisfaction. A total of 36 Senior One students from a senior high school in Kaohsiung were selected as the research subjects in two classes per week for 13 weeks. Questionnaires and qualitative interviews were used to understand the correlation between students' self-efficacy, anxiety, outcomes, and learning satisfaction with the AIOT course during the flipped learning process. The study used SmartPLS3 to analyze the measurement model and structural model, and bootstrapping to conduct the path analysis and validate the research hypotheses. Because this research provides students with relevant online teaching videos for linking and browsing in the textbooks, and the video time should not be too long, in the teaching process, small-scale online learning courses are adopted for flipped teaching, which promptly arouses students' interest and enhances their learning participation. Through the sharing of homework with each other, its content deficiencies were modified, students' anxiety in learning was reduced, and the effect of learning and thinking together was achieved; in the teaching mode, theoretical content was combined with physical and practical courses to implement cross-disciplinary. To learn, the principle of 4D double diamond design to make "reciprocal corrections" between curriculum planning and teaching implementation as the teaching model framework was used. The results of this study show "self-efficacy" has a significant positive effect on the "perceived usefulness" and "perceived ease of use" of users. "Learning anxiety" does not significantly predict the "perceived ease of use" or "perceived usefulness" of flipped learning using online e-learning. The "perceived ease of use" and "perceived usefulness" have positive impacts on the prediction of "behavioral intention" in flipped teaching using online digital teaching materials. The "perceived ease of use" has a positive and high impact on "perceived usefulness". "Learning engagement" positively affects students' actual "behavioral intention" towards learning.

Recent advances in machine learning algorithms and accessibility to big data sources have created the ability for software to solve highly specialized problems outside of health care, such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and game playing (chess and Go), at superhuman efficiency previously not thought possible. To date, high-order cognitive problems in cardiovascular research such as differential diagnosis, treatment options, and clinical risk stratification have been difficult to address at scale with artificial intelligence. The practical application of artificial intelligence in the underlying operational processes in the delivery of cardiac care may be more amenable where adoption has great potential to fundamentally transform care delivery while maintaining the core quality and service that our patients demand. In this article, we provide an overview on how these artificial intelligence platforms can be implemented to improve the operational delivery of care for patients with cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual's mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals' mental states.

  abstract = {Fall risk assessment is essential to predict and prevent falls in geriatric populations, especially patients with life-long conditions like neurological disorders. Inertial sensor-based pervasive gait analysis systems have become viable means to facilitate continuous fall risk assessment in non-hospital settings. However, a gait analysis system is not sufficient to detect the characteristics leading to increased fall risk, and powerful inference models are required to detect the underlying factors specific to fall risk. Machine learning models and especially the recently proposed deep learning methods offer the needed predictive power. Deep neural networks have the potential to produce models that can operate directly on the raw data, thus alleviating the need for feature engineering. However, the domain knowledge inherent in the well-established spatio-temporal gait parameters are still valuable to help a model achieve high inference accuracies. In this study, we explore deep learning methods, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, for the problem of fall risk assessment. We utilize sequences of spatio-temporal gait parameters extracted by an inertial sensor-based gait analysis system as input features. To quantify the performance of the proposed approach, we compare it with more traditional machine learning methods. The proposed LSTM model, trained with a gait dataset collected from 60 neurological disorder patients, achieves a superior classification accuracy of 92.1\% on a separate test dataset collected from 16 patients. This study serves as one of the first attempts to employ deep learning approaches in this domain and the results demonstrate their potential.},

The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.},

  abstract = {Vocal fold disorders such as laryngitis, vocal nodules, and vocal polyps may cause hoarseness, breathing and swallowing difficulties due to vocal fold malfunction. Despite the fact that state of the art medical imaging techniques help physicians to obtain more detailed information, difficulty in differentiating minor anomalies of vocal folds encourages physicians to research new strategies and technologies to aid the diagnostic process. Recent studies on vocal fold disorders note the potential role of the vascular structure of vocal folds in differential diagnosis of anomalies. However, standards of clinical usage of the blood vessels have not been well established yet due to the lack of objective and comprehensive evaluation of the vascular structure. In this paper, we present a novel approach that categorizes vocal folds into healthy, nodule, polyp, sulcus vocalis, and laryngitis classes exploiting visible blood vessels on the superior surface of vocal folds and shapes of vocal fold edges by using image processing techniques and machine learning methods. We first detected the vocal folds on videolaryngostroboscopy images by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors. Then we examined the shape of vocal fold edges in order to provide features such as size and splay portion of mass lesions. We developed a new vessel centerline extraction procedure that is specialized to the vascular structure of vocal folds. Extracted vessel centerlines were evaluated in order to get vascular features of vocal folds, such as the amount of vessels in the longitudinal and transverse form. During the last step, categorization of vocal folds was performed by a novel binary decision tree architecture, which evaluates features of the vocal fold edge shape and vascular structure. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated by using laryngeal images of 70 patients. Sensitivity of 86\%, 94\%, 80\%, 73\%, and 76\% were obtained for healthy, polyp, nodule, laryngitis, and sulcus vocalis classes, respectively. These results indicate that visible vessels of vocal folds can act as a prognostic marker for vocal fold pathologies, as well as the vocal fold shape features, and may play a critical role in more effective diagnosis.

  abstract = {Objective: To develop an automated method of applying the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system utilizing machine learning on electronic health record (EHR) data (TOAST-AI). Background(s): Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide, and optimal management depends on recognizing stroke subtype. However, traditional stroke subtyping is laborious and requires clinical expertise. Since stroke subtypes have not been classified in most large-scale data repositories, automated subtyping would empower efforts to examine subtype determinants and prognosis. Design/Methods: We utilized the EHR data of 1,598 patients with strokes manually subtyped according to TOAST in the Massachusetts General Hospital Ischemic Stroke Registry (2002- 2010). In addition to demographics and risk factors, we developed and utilized several novel stroke-specific discriminatory features such as stroke localization, appearance, and vessel stenosis. These features were developed using regular expressions applied on an external dataset of 459,702 radiology reports. We then utilized these EHR features to train a random forest model to discriminate stroke subtypes by TOAST criteria. Result(s): The analysis sample comprised 360 Definite Cardioembolic (DefCE), 259 Possible Cardioembolic (PosCE), 371 Large Artery Atherosclerosis (LAA), 174 Small Artery Occlusion (SAA), and 278 Undetermined (Undet) strokes. The random forest model showed moderate-to-good classification performance (C-statistic for each subtype: DefCE = 0.93, PosCE = 0.83, LAA = 0.79, SAA = 0.86, and Undet = 0.81). Of the more than fifty features included in the model, those demonstrating greatest influence on performance included atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, lacunar syndrome by neuroradiology report, PR-interval, and severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Conclusion(s): Accurate and efficient stroke subtyping using automated algorithms utilizing EHR data is feasible. Future work is warranted to externally validate our model, apply it in large datasets to facilitate investigation of subtype-specific risk factors, and explore implementation for clinical decision support.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an ensemble stacked generalization (ESG) approach for better prediction of electric vehicles (EVs) energy consumption. ESG is a weighted combination of multiple base regression models to one meta-regressor, which enhances the model prediction and decreases the model variance over a single regressor model. For the current study, we develop ESG by combining three individual base machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to predict the EVs' energy consumption. Tackling the challenge of predicting EVs' energy consumption, the data were collected from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, combining the digital elevation map with long-term GPS tracking data. EVs energy consumption in terms of energy efficiency (kWh/km) was estimated using several important variables such as average trip speed (km/h), trip distance, nighttime lighting, air conditioner (A/C), heater usage ratio, and road gradient. Several statistical evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The prediction results show that ESG is more robust in predicting EVs' energy consumption and outperformed other models by yielding more acceptable values for proposed evaluation metrics. The results further demonstrate that the accuracy of predictive models for EVs energy consumption can be reasonably accomplished by adopting stacking techniques. The finding of this study could provide essential guidance to decision-makers and practitioners for planned development and optimal placing of EV charging infrastructures in urban areas.},

While these prediction models often produce promising results, a deployment in clinical settings is rarely pursued., OBJECTIVES: In this study, we demonstrate how prediction tools can be integrated generically into a clinical setting and provide an exemplary use case for predicting relapse risk in melanoma patients., METHODS: To make the decision support architecture independent of the electronic health record (EHR) and transferable to different hospital environments, it was based on the widely used Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) rather than on a proprietary EHR data structure. The usability of our exemplary implementation was evaluated by means of conducting user interviews including the thinking-aloud protocol and the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire., RESULTS: An extract-transform-load process was developed to extract relevant clinical and molecular data from their original sources and map them to OMOP. Further, the OMOP WebAPI was adapted to retrieve all data for a single patient and transfer them into the decision support Web application for enabling physicians to easily consult the prediction service including monitoring of transferred data. The evaluation of the application resulted in a SUS score of 86.7., CONCLUSION: This work proposes an EHR-independent means of integrating prediction models for deployment in clinical settings, utilizing the OMOP CDM. The usability evaluation revealed that the application is generally suitable for routine use while also illustrating small aspects for improvement. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment.Conclusion:Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.},

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.},

In this paper, we focus on the epistemological issues arising from the development and implementation of a class of AI for clinical practice, namely clinical decision support systems (CDSS). We will first provide an overview of the epistemic tasks of medical professionals, and then analyse which of these tasks can be supported by CDSS, while also explaining why some of them should remain the territory of human experts. Clinical decision making involves a reasoning process in which clinicians combine different types of information into a coherent and adequate 'picture of the patient' that enables them to draw explainable and justifiable conclusions for which they bear epistemological responsibility. Therefore, we suggest that it is more appropriate to think of a CDSS as clinical reasoning support systems (CRSS). Developing CRSS that support clinicians' reasoning process therefore requires that: (a) CRSSs are developed on the basis of relevant and well-processed data; and (b) the system facilitates an interaction with the clinician. Therefore, medical experts must collaborate closely with AI experts developing the CRSS. In addition, responsible use of an CRSS requires that the data generated by the CRSS is empirically justified through an empirical link with the individual patient. In practice, this means that the system indicates what factors contributed to arriving at an advice, allowing the user (clinician) to evaluate whether these factors are medically plausible and applicable to the patient. Finally, we defend that proper implementation of CRSS allows combining human and artificial intelligence into hybrid intelligence, were both perform clearly delineated and complementary empirical tasks. Whereas CRSSs can assist with statistical reasoning and finding patterns in complex data, it is the clinicians' task to interpret, integrate and contextualize. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in incorporating clinical decision support (CDS) into electronic healthcare records (EHR). Successful implementation of CDS systems depends on acceptance of them by healthcare workers. We used a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods starting from Qsort methodology to explore expectations and perceptions of practicing physicians on the use of CDS incorporated in EHR., METHODS: The study was performed in a large tertiary care academic hospital. We used a mixed approach with a Q-sort based classification of pre-defined reactions to clinical case vignettes combined with a thinking-aloud approach, taking into account COREQ recommendations The open source software of Ken-Q Analysis version 1.0.6. was used for the quantitative analysis, using principal components and a Varimax rotation. For the qualitative analysis, a thematic analysis based on the four main themes was performed based on the audiotapes and field notes., RESULTS: Thirty physicians were interviewed (7 in training, 8 junior staff and 15 senior staff; 16 females). Nearly all respondents were strongly averse towards interruptive messages, especially when these also were obstructive. Obstructive interruption was considered to be acceptable only when it increases safety, is adjustable to user expertise level and/or allows deviations when the end-user explains why a deviation is desirable in the case at issue. Transparency was deemed an essential feature, which seems to boil down to providing sufficient clarification on the factors underlying the recommendations of the CDS, so that these can be compared against the physicians' existing knowledge, beliefs and convictions., CONCLUSION: Avoidance of disruptive workflows and transparency of the underlying decision processes are important points to consider when developing CDS systems incorporated in EHR.

  abstract = {Background and Aims: The reported associated mortality risks of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are variable. Although the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (K-DIGO) improved harmonisation of the definition, there is remaining variability in the actual implementation of this AKI definition, with variable use of the urinary output (UO) criterion, and different interpretations of the baseline serum creatinine (Screa). This hampers progress of our understanding of the clinical concept AKI and leads to confusion and unclarity when interpreting models to predict AKI associated outcomes. With the advent of big data and artificial intelligence based decision algorithms, this problem will only become more of interest, as the user will not know what exactly the construct AKI in the application used means. Therefore, we intended to explore the impact of different interpretations of the Screa and the UO criterium as presented in the K-DIGO definition on the associated ICU mortality risk of AKI stage 2 in the ICU. Method(s): We included all patients of an electronic health data system applied in a tertiary ICU between 2013 and 2017. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated, and gender, age, weight and mortality at ICU and in hospital were extracted. All serum creatinine (sCrea) values during ICU stay and hospitalisation were extracted, as were UO data, with their time stamps. In addition, all Screa data up to 1 year before ICU admission were retrieved from a dataset external to ICU. AKI was defined according to KDIGO stage 2, using different possible interpretations of the Screa and/or the UO criterion. For the evolution of Screa as compared to a baseline value, we either used a value directly available to ICU staff (def 1), a presumed eGFR of 75ml/min (def 2), the first available value after admission to ICU (def 3), the lowest value during the current hospitalisation before ICU admission (def 4), the lowest value before the hospitalisation episode as found in an external dataset (def 5). For the UO criterion, we used either (in line with K-DIGO stage 2) a UO below 6ml/kg during a 12 hour block (def 6) or a UO below 0.5ml/kg/hour during each of 12 consecutive one hour intervals (def 7). Definition 8 and 9 identified patients who complied with at least one out of the Screa criteria 1-5 (def 8) or out of the UO criteria (def 9). Definition 10 identified patients who complied both with at least one Screa and one UO criterium. Result(s): Our dataset comprised 16433 admissions (34.7\% female, age 60.7+/-16.4 years). Overall, 8.1\% of patients died in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The SOFA score at admission was 6.9+/-4.1. The mortality risk associated with AKI according to the stage 2 definition of K-DIGO varied according to the interpretation of the diagnostic criteria (table). Most important, associated mortality risk was comparable whether a UO (RR 2.31, 95\% CI 1.90-2.81) or a Screa (RR 2.00, 95\% CI 1.57-2.55) criterium was used, and was highest in patients who complied with both at least one UO and one Screa criterium (RR 7.28, 95\% CI 6.12-8.65). Conclusion(s): Unclarity on the actual interpretation of the Screa and UO criteria used in the K-DIGO definition of AKI leads to substantial differences in AKI associated mortality risk. Omitting the UO criterium leads to substantial underestimation of associated risk (Figure Presented).},

  abstract = {Background Technological progress in artificial intelligence has led to the increasing popularity of virtual assistants, i.e., embodied or disembodied conversational agents that allow chatting with a technical system in a natural language. However, only little comprehensive research is conducted about patients' perceptions and possible applications of virtual assistant in healthcare with cancer patients. This research aims to investigate the key acceptance factors and value-adding use cases of a virtual assistant for patients diagnosed with cancer. Methods Qualitative interviews with eight former patients and four doctors of a Dutch radiotherapy institute were conducted to determine what acceptance factors they find most important for a virtual assistant and gain insights into value-adding applications. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was used to structure perceptions and was inductively modified as a result of the interviews. The subsequent research model was triangulated via an online survey with 127 respondents diagnosed with cancer. A structural equation model was used to determine the relevance of acceptance factors. Through a multigroup analysis, differences between sample subgroups were compared. Results The interviews found support for all factors of the UTAUT: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. Additionally, self-efficacy, trust, and resistance to change, were added as an extension of the UTAUT. Former patients found a virtual assistant helpful in receiving information about logistic questions, treatment procedures, side effects, or scheduling appointments. The quantitative study found that the constructs performance expectancy (ss = 0.399), effort expectancy (ss = 0.258), social influence (ss = 0.114), and trust (ss = 0.210) significantly influenced behavioral intention to use a virtual assistant, explaining 80\% of its variance. Self-efficacy (ss = 0.792) acts as antecedent of effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and resistance to change were not found to have a significant relationship with user intention. Conclusions Performance and effort expectancy are the leading determinants of virtual assistant acceptance. The latter is dependent on a patient's self-efficacy. Therefore, including patients during the development and introduction of a VA in cancer treatment is important. The high relevance of trust indicates the need for a reliable, secure service that should be promoted as such. Social influence suggests using doctors in endorsing the VA.},

However, reproducibility of histological typing is not high because of the absence of strict typing criteria, variations in the application of the typing criteria and the usually limited illustration of the relevant criteria. The aim of this study was to develop an expert system based on highly structured histological typing criteria, integrated with high-quality microscope images to illustrate the typing criteria. This system should be useful as a decision support system in the diagnosis of breast cancers and should increase the reproducibility of histological typing. Criteria for typing were extracted from textbooks and, based on experience, these criteria were structured and implemented in the Relation Oriented Inference System (ROIS), in which information can be structured by defining relations. Illustrative black and white images were digitized and integrated into the shell. The performance of the resulting decision support system was evaluated by a group of six pathologists using a set of slides covering the spectrum of the most frequently occurring histological types of invasive breast cancer. The pathologists first assessed histological type according to standard morphological procedures. The cases were then reassessed with the decision support system available for consultation. The use of the decision support system appeared to influence the previously assessed histological type in about half of the cases. Using the decision support system, histological typing was more uniform and more in accord with a 'gold standard' set by two experts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In this modern era, deep architectures have shown a significant performance on computer vision problems. Instead of developing a new model from scratch, the pre-trained convolutional neural network models are available to obtain the appropriate features from input samples using the transfer-learning technique. This work utilizes the transfer-learning approach for feature extraction and classification performed using the proposed modified third-tam Backpropagation (BP) algorithm. This proposed algorithm contains Inertia as a third factor in the weight updation rule expanded in the form of the Legendre polynomial to overcome the limitations of the traditional Backpropagation algorithm.

  abstract = {Treatment decisions are becoming more and more complex for physicians. The amount of data and parameters of the patient and tumor that possibly affect the outcome is still increasing. Clinical trials are still the standard reference for innovation in treatment, but there is not always consensus in the field. Using the computational power of predictions models for treatment outcome may be very useful to assist in clinical decision making and to deal with this increasing data complexity. These models are specialized in finding patterns in the data, in such a way that only the relevant input data will be associated with the output. A large variety of data sources is required to optimally predict the outcome, i.e. predict the outcome with sufficient accuracy. Successful applications of these models are expected to facilitate individualized medicine and improve healthcare outcome in general. There are various methods to develop the described models. Traditional statistical methods like for example logistic regression for binary data and Cox regression for survival data are widely used in medical literature. Another field which deals with similar classification problems is the machine learning field. This field has its origins in the artificial intelligence and is another approach to statistics; machine learning models try to find patterns in data and are designed to learn from examples. They can actually be trained to perform a specific task, like for example predicting time-to-survival for cancer patients. The teaching lecture will involve a step-by-step practical guide for the process of development of decision making models. The concepts involved are data collection, data preprocessing, data transformation, predictor selection, model training, performance evaluation and validation strategies. Successful examples of clinical decision making models will be presented and a tutorial on how to use and interpret them is provided. Clinical decision making using prediction models is currently gaining interest in the radiotherapy field. Disseminating knowledge and full transparency about clinical decision making is however still one of the keys to increase acceptance for this concept in the community and to implement it in clinical practice.},

The main problem in using Artificial Intelligence is that researchers and practitioners are not able to know how the predictions are generated. This is currently an open issue because results' explainability is advantageous in understanding the reasoning behind the model, both for patients than for implementing a feedback mechanism for medical specialists using decision support systems. Methods : Addressing transparency issues related to the Artificial Intelligence field, the innovative technique of Formal methods use a mathematical logic reasoning to produce an automatic, quick and reliable diagnosis. In this paper we analyze results given by the adoption of Formal methods for the diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease: specifically, we want to analyse and understand, in a more medical way, the meaning of some radiomic features to connect them with clinical or radiological evidences. Results : In particular, the usage of Formal methods allows the authors to do statistical analysis on the feature value distributions, to do pattern recognition on disease models, to generalize the model of a disease and to reach high performances of results and interpretation of them. A further step for explainability can be accounted by the localization and selection of the most important slices in a multi-slice approach. Conclusions : In conclusion, we confirmed the clinical significance of some First order features as Skewness and Kurtosis. On the other hand, we suggest to decline the use of the Minimum feature because of its intrinsic connection with the Computational Tomography exam of the lung.},

Patients who were assigned level 1 or 2A evidence for oncogenic gene variants by an artificial intelligence offering (IBM Watson for Genomics [WfG]) and NPOP staff were selected. Antineoplastic drug prescriptions and provider notes were reviewed. Reasons for withholding targeted treatments were categorized., RESULTS: Of 1,749 patients with NSCLC who successfully underwent NGS gene panel testing, 112 (6.4\%) patients were assigned level 1 and/or 2A evidence for available targeted treatments by WfG and NPOP staff. All highly actionable gene variants were within ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, MET, RET, and ROS1. Of these, 36 (32.1\%) patients were not prescribed targeted agents. The three most common reasons were (1) patient did not carry a diagnosis of metastatic disease (33.3\%), (2) treating provider did not comment on the NGS results (25.0\%), and (3) provider felt that patient could not tolerate therapy (19.4\%). No patients were denied access to level 1 or 2A targeted drugs because of rejection of a nonformulary drug request., CONCLUSION: A substantial minority of patients with NSCLC bearing highly actionable gene variants are not prescribed targeted agents. Further provider- and pathologist-directed educational efforts and implementation of health informatics systems to provide real-time decision support for test ordering and interpretation are needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) gene panels are often completed to guide therapeutic decisions for patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with highly-actionable gene variants may experience improved therapeutic treatments and reduced toxicities with use of targeted agents. Ensuring appropriate prescription of targeted therapies is therefore of high importance. We sought to identify barriers to targeted agent use within the Veterans Health Affairs' (VHA) National Precision Oncology Program (NPOP). Method(s): A retrospective evaluation examined the cohort of NSCLC patients who underwent NGS multi-gene panels through NPOP between July 2015 and February 2019. A level of evidence for drug actionability was assigned to each observed oncogenic gene variant using an artificial intelligence offering (IBM Watson for Genomics: WfG). WfG level 1 and 2A evidence was reviewed by NPOP staff to exclude gene variants that did not conform to NPOP level 1 and 2A definitions. Anti-neoplastic drug prescriptions and oncology provider notes were obtained for all included patients from the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse. Review of clinical notes of patients who did not receive targeted agents was performed to categorize the reason(s). Result(s): Of 1764 NSCLC patients who successfully underwent NGS gene panel testing, 156 (8.9\%) received therapeutic level 1 (7.3\%) or 2A (1.6\%) options for targeted agents based on WfG evidence analysis. In total, 117 (6.6\%) patients had NPOP level 1 and 2A gene variants, all within ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, MET, and RET. Of these, 49 (41.2\%) patients were not prescribed available targeted agents. The three most common reasons were: (1) treating provider did not comment on NGS results (30.7\%), (2) patient did not carry a diagnosis of advanced stage disease (18.4\%), and (3) patient had begun an alternative systemic therapy prior to completion of sequencing (16.3\%). No patient was denied access to a level 1 or 2A targeted drug due to utilization-management review. Conclusion(s): A substantial minority of patients with advanced NSCLC bearing highlyactionable gene variants are not prescribed available targeted agents. Further provider-and pathologistdirected educational effort are needed, as well as implementation of health informatics systems to provide near real-time decision support for test ordering and interpretation.},

  abstract = {Edge computing is a fast-growing and much needed technology in healthcare. The problem of implementing artificial intelligence on edge devices is the complexity and high resource intensity of the most known neural network data analysis methods and algorithms. The difficulty of implementing these methods on low-power microcontrollers with small memory size calls for the development of new effective algorithms for neural networks. This study presents a new method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The method effectively solves classification problems and calculates risk factors for the presence of a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on cardiotocogram data obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. The classification accuracy reaches \textasciitilde 91\% with the\textasciitilde 3-10 kB of RAM used on the Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly available database of the Israeli Ministry of Health, a service concept for COVID-19 express testing is provided. A classification accuracy of \textasciitilde 95\% is achieved, and\textasciitilde 0.6 kB of RAM is used. In all examples, the model is tested using standard classification quality metrics: precision, recall, and F1-measure. The LogNNet architecture allows the implementation of artificial intelligence on medical peripherals of the Internet of Things with low RAM resources and can be used in clinical decision support systems.},

  abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.}

  abstract = {Electronic medical record (EMR) systems can deliver many benefits to healthcare organizations and the patients they serve. However, one of the biggest stumbling blocks in garnering these benefits is the limited adoption and use by doctors. We employ the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical foundation and adapt the theory to the context of EMR system adoption and use by doctors. Specifically, we suggest that age will be the only significant moderator, and gender, voluntariness and experience will not play significant moderating roles. We tested our model in a longitudinal study over a 7-month period in a hospital implementing a new EMR system. We collected 3 waves of survey data from 141 doctors and used system logs to measure use. While the original UTAUT only predicted about 20\% of the variance in intention, the modified UTAUT predicted 44\%. Both models were comparable in their prediction of use. In addition to contributing to healthcare IT and UTAUT research, we hope this work will serve as a foundation for future work that integrates UTAUT with other theoretical perspectives.},

  abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems (IS) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the IS literature on UTAUT from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of UTAUT and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined UTAUT and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to UTAUT, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of UTAUT using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing UTAUT extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future UTAUT-related research using the proposed framework.},

As a first step, some critical issues that relate to AI tools in general, humans in the context of AI tools, and AI tools in the context of operations management are identified. A discussion of how these issues could hinder employee adoption and use of AI tools is presented. Building on this discussion, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is used as a theoretical basis to propose individual characteristics, technology characteristics, environmental characteristics and interventions as viable research directions that could not only contribute to the adoption literature, particularly as it relates to AI tools, but also, if pursued, such research could help organizations positively influence the adoption of AI tools.},

  abstract = {Background: Microservices are an architectural approach of growing use, and the optimal granularity of a microservice directly affects the application's quality attributes and usage of computational resources. Determining microservice granularity is an open research topic. Methodology: We conducted a systematic literature review to analyze literature that addresses the definition of microservice granularity. We searched in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and Scopus. The research questions were: Which approaches have been proposed to define microservice granularity and determine the microservices' size? Which metrics are used to evaluate microservice granularity? Which quality attributes are addressed when researching microservice granularity? Results: We found 326 papers and selected 29 after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality attributes most often addressed are runtime properties (e.g., scalability and performance), not development properties (e.g., maintainability). Most proposed metrics were about the product, both static (coupling, cohesion, complexity, source code) and runtime (performance, and usage of computational resources), and a few were about the development team and process. The most used techniques for defining microservices granularity were machine learning (clustering), semantic similarity, genetic programming, and domain engineering. Most papers were concerned with migration from monoliths to microservices; and a few addressed green-field development, but none address improvement of granularity in existing microservice-based systems. Conclusions: Methodologically speaking, microservice granularity research is at a Wild West stage: no standard definition, no clear development-operation trade-offs, and scarce conceptual reuse (e.g., few methods seem applicable or replicable in projects other than their initial proposal). These gaps in granularity research offer clear options to investigate on continuous improvement of the development and operation of microservice-based systems.},

Designing a diagnostic system, which is cost-efficient and convenient to operate on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones would enhance the clinical usage of chest CT scans and provide swift, mobile, and accessible diagnostic capabilities. This work proposes developing a novel Android application that detects COVID-19 infection from chest CT scans using a highly efficient and accurate deep learning algorithm. It further creates an attention heatmap, augmented on the segmented lung parenchyma region in the chest CT scans which shows the regions of infection in the lungs through an algorithm developed as a part of this work, and verified through radiologists. We propose a novel selection approach combined with multi-threading for a faster generation of heatmaps on a Mobile Device, which reduces the processing time by about 93\%. The neural network trained to detect COVID-19 in this work is tested with a F1 score and accuracy, both of 99.58\% and sensitivity of 99.69\%, which is better than most of the results in the domain of COVID diagnosis from CT scans. This work will be beneficial in high-volume practices and help doctors triage patients for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 quickly and efficiently.},

There is mounting evidence that the technology fueled by ML has the potential to detect and substantially improve treatment of complex mental disorders such as depression. We developed a framework capable of detecting depression with minimal human intervention: artificial intelligence mental evaluation (AiME). This framework consists of a short human-computer interactive evaluation that utilizes artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, and can predict whether the participant is depressed or not with satisfactory performance. Because of its ease of use, this technology can offer a viable tool for mental health professionals to identify symptoms of depression, thus enabling a faster preventative intervention. Furthermore, it may alleviate the challenge of observing and interpreting highly nuanced physiological and behavioral biomarkers of depression by providing a more objective evaluation.

Self-management strategies can result in improved health outcomes and reduce unscheduled care and improve disease control. However, adherence assessment suffers from difficulties on attaining a high grade of trustworthiness given that patient self-reports of high-adherence rates are known to be unreliable. Objective Aiming to increase patient adherence to medication and allow for remote monitoring by health professionals, a mobile gamified application was developed where a therapeutic plan provides insight for creating a patient-oriented self-management system. To allow a reliable adherence measurement, the application includes a novel approach for objective verification of inhaler usage based on real-time video capture of the inhaler's dosage counters. Methods This approach uses template matching image processing techniques, an off-the-shelf machine learning framework, and was developed to be reusable within other applications. The proposed approach was validated by 24 participants with a set of 12 inhalers models. Results Performed tests resulted in the correct value identification for the dosage counter in 79\% of the registration events with all inhalers and over 90\% for the three most widely used inhalers in Portugal. These results show the potential of exploring mobile-embedded capabilities for acquiring additional evidence regarding inhaler adherence. Conclusion This system helps to bridge the gap between the patient and the health professional. By empowering the first with a tool for disease self-management and medication adherence and providing the later with additional relevant data, it paves the way to a better-informed disease management decision.},

National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them., SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities., AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination., AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions., GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making., AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.

The ever increasing usage of Machine Learning techniques is the clearest example of such trend. This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in prediction accuracy and a reduced time to obtain the results. However, these methods present a major drawback: it is very difficult to understand on what grounds the algorithm took the decision. To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations. Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is crucial. As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the explanations returned.},

  abstract = {Objective: Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of infections in critically ill patients should be started as soon as possible, as delay in treatment may reduce a patient's prognostic outlook considerably. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in patients in intensive care units who are mechanically ventilated and is almost always preceded by colonisation of the respiratory tract by the causative microorganisms. It is very difficult to clinically diagnose VAP and, therefore, some form of computer-based decision support might be helpful for the clinician. Materials and methods: As diagnosing and treating VAP involves reasoning with uncertainty, we have used a Bayesian network as the primary tool. for building a decision-support system. The effects of usage of antibiotics on the colonisation of the respiratory tract by various pathogens and the subsequent antibiotic choices in case of VAP were modelled using the notion of causal independence. In particular, the conditional probability distribution of the random variable that represents the overall coverage of pathogens by antibiotics was modelled in terms of the conjunctive effect of the seven different pathogens, usually referred to as the noisy-AND model. In this paper, we investigate different coverage models, as well as generalisations of the noisy-AND, called noisy-threshold models, and test them on clinical data of intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are mechanically ventilated. Results: Some of the constructed noisy-threshold models offered further improvement of the performance of the Bayesian network in covering present causative pathogens by advising appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Conclusions: By reconsidering the modelling of interactions between the random variables in a Bayesian network using the theory of causal independence, it is possible to refine its performance. This was clearly shown for our Bayesian network concerning VAP, indicating that only specific noisy-threshold models might be appropriate for the modelling of the interaction between pathogens and antimicrobial treatment with respect to susceptibility. The results obtained also provide evidence that the noisy-OR and noisy-AND might not always be the best functions to model interactions among random variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As recent advancements have improved the portability of modern X-ray systems, this study represents an early evaluation of the safety, image quality and yield of using an ultra-portable X-ray system for active case finding (ACF). We reported operational and radiological performance characteristics and compared image quality between the ultra-portable and two reference systems. Image quality was rated by three human readers and by an artificial intelligence (AI) software. We deployed the ultra-portable X-ray alongside the reference system for community-based ACF and described TB care cascades for each system. The ultra-portable system operated within advertised specifications and radiologic tolerances, except on X-ray capture capacity, which was 58\% lower than the reported maximum of 100 exposures per charge. The mean image quality rating from radiologists for the ultra-portable system was significantly lower than the reference (3.71 vs. 3.99, p {$<$} 0.001). However, we detected no significant differences in TB abnormality scores using the AI software (p = 0.571), nor in any of the steps along the TB care cascade during our ACF campaign. Despite some shortcomings, ultra-portable X-ray systems have significant potential to improve case detection and equitable access to high-quality TB care.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is preceded by a lengthy 'preclinical' stage spanning many years, during which subtle brain changes occur in the absence of overt cognitive symptoms. Predicting when the onset of disease symptoms will occur is an unsolved challenge in individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In individuals with autosomal dominant genetic Alzheimer's disease, the age of symptom onset is similar across generations, allowing the prediction of individual onset times with some accuracy. We extend this concept to persons with a parental history of sporadic Alzheimer's disease to test whether an individual's symptom onset age can be informed by the onset age of their affected parent, and whether this estimated onset age can be predicted using only MRI. Structural and functional MRIs were acquired from 255 ageing cognitively healthy subjects with a parental history of sporadic Alzheimer's disease from the PREVENT-AD cohort. Years to estimated symptom onset was calculated as participant age minus age of parental symptom onset. Grey matter volume was extracted from T-1-weighted images and whole-brain resting state functional connectivity was evaluated using degree count. Both modalities were summarized using a 444-region cortical-subcortical atlas. The entire sample was divided into training (n = 138) and testing (n = 68) sets. Within the training set, individuals closer to or beyond their parent's symptom onset demonstrated reduced grey matter volume and altered functional connectivity, specifically in regions known to be vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning was used to identify a weighted set of imaging features trained to predict years to estimated symptom onset. This feature set alone significantly predicted years to estimated symptom onset in the unseen testing data. This model, using only neuroimaging features, significantly outperformed a similar model instead trained with cognitive, genetic, imaging and demographic features used in a traditional clinical setting. We next tested if these brain properties could be generalized to predict time to clinical progression in a subgroup of 26 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, who eventually converted either to mild cognitive impairment or to Alzheimer's dementia. The feature set trained on years to estimated symptom onset in the PREVENT-AD predicted variance in time to clinical conversion in this separate longitudinal dataset. Adjusting for participant age did not impact any of the results. These findings demonstrate that years to estimated symptom onset or similar measures can be predicted from brain features and may help estimate presymptomatic disease progression in at-risk individuals.},

  abstract = {Intelligent systems such as technologies related to artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, etc. open new insights into data and expand the concept of work in myriad domains. These technologies, while potentially useful, face high barriers to widespread adoption and acceptance by industries and citizens alike. The complexity and multi-dimensionality inherent in intelligent systems often renders traditional validation efforts (e.g., traceability analysis) impossible. In addition, contexts where predictions or computer-generated recommendations have real-world consequences, such as in medical prognosis, financial investing, or military applications introduce new risks and a host of moral and ethical concerns that can further hinder the widespread adoption of intelligent systems. Naturally, such reluctance by would-be users limits the potential of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems. This article reviews the challenges to technology acceptance through the lens of system transparency and user trust, and extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) structure with issues germane to intelligent systems. We examine several prospective transparency frameworks that could be adopted and used by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners involved in systems development. Our intention is to assist practitioners in the design of more transparent systems with a specific eye towards enhancing trust and acceptance in intelligent systems. Further, as a result of our review, we suggest that the well-known TAM should be expanded in the context of intelligent systems to include trust and transparency as key elements of the model. Finally, we conclude with a research agenda that might offer empirical evidence showing how transparency might enhance acceptance and use of intelligent systems.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Screening tests have been widely assessed in terms of clinical and cost effectiveness. Test Papanicolaou remains the cornerstone in cervical cancer screening but guidelines suggest that each option is assessed according to RCT data. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a technique that compares relative costs and outcomes of alternative interventions used for the same health outcome. It facilitates the comparison of different technologies. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) represents the average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect. ICER focuses on more expensive/effective interventions. The aim of our study was to develop and assess what would allow a more accurate way of determining women that should really proceed to further investigation during an organized screening process. Material(s) and Method(s): The data were selected by nationwide colposcopy units 1251 women consented to participate. For the DSS, a combinatorial approach of high throughput technologies were used (Molecular biology techniques, Bioinformatics, Computational Modelling and Artificial Intelligence). Cumulative risk scenarios, produced as outputs, were accessed in terms of cost effectiveness. Costs of each test (unit cost) and transportation cost calculated through a probabilistic allocation. Positive predictive value (PPV) and Youden's Index were determined in order to represent effectiveness. The study had certain limitations including the lack of follow-up data on women so as to evaluate the long term effectiveness. Moreover, certain costs were not incorporated into the analysis due to lack of follow-up and/or difficulty in evaluation. Result(s): According to the analysis, when willingness to pay is under 1.5 euro per PPV unit, test-pap is a cost effective choice for screening. According to Youden's Index test-pap is a cost effective alternative even when society's willingness to pay is approximately 16 euro/unit. Conclusion(s): Molecular tests are associated with increased effectiveness but also high costs, thus broad implementation in general population is discouraged. On the other hand, high cost could be justified in certain sub-groups with significant social interest (high risk women, populations with limited access to services).},

The usage of blockchain technology has been increasingly used in different fields, and healthcare services are now using blockchain for better patient delivery, detecting disease, and other aspects. The scope of the proposed study is that this study has exploited the function of a blockchain-enabled big data network to support medical professionals in giving better treatment modalities and delivering better patient care. The application of a new generation of smart block chains such as Ethereum and NEM is now offering better services and features in creating blockchain-based healthcare data management and hence support healthcare centers, medical practitioners, nurses, radiologists, and patients for better healthcare management. The application of blockchain technology in big data networks supports adding more value as it results in enhanced data quality, accessibility, and support in creating better security and safety of data and information, which is highly essential in the medical industry. Blockchain technology enables big data technologies enabled in supporting medical practitioners in addressing various healthcare ailments; one of the major diseases impacting many people around the world is diabetes. Patients with such ailments tend to generate more data and information related to the disease and health-related aspects. Hence, this information requires being maintained and analyzed, so that superior healthcare services can be provided. This study is more involved in the investigation of blockchain technology through a big data network enabled in offering better care for elderly individuals who have been affected due to diabetes, the researchers propose to choose a questionnaire method to collect the data from nearly 169 respondents, and these data were then analyzed using SPSS data package. The analyst used percentage analysis, correlation analysis, and chi-square test to analyze the data which has been collated by the researchers.

Research suggests a tendency to use self-care treatment options such as over-the-counter (OTC) complementary medications among prostate cancer patients. The current trend in patient-driven recording of health data in an online Personal Health Record (PHR) presents an opportunity to develop new data-driven approaches for improving prostate cancer patient care. However, the ability of current online solutions to share patients' data for better decision support is limited. An informatics approach may improve online sharing of self- care interventions among these patients. It can also provide better evidence to support decisions made during their self- managed care. Aims To identify requirements for an online system and describe a new case-based reasoning (CBR) method for improving self-care of advanced prostate cancer patients in an online PHR environment. Method A non-identifying online survey was conducted to understand self-care patterns among prostate cancer patients and to identify requirements for an online information system. The pilot study was carried out between August 2010 and December 2010. A case-base of 52 patients was developed. Results The data analysis showed self-care patterns among the prostate cancer patients. Selenium (55\%) was the common complementary supplement used by the patients. Paracetamol (about 45\%) was the commonly used OTC by the patients. Conclusion The results of this study specified requirements for an online case-based reasoning information system. The outcomes of this study are being incorporated in design of the proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven patient journey browser system. A basic version of the proposed system is currently being considered for implementation.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for {$>$}= 2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9 {$>$}= 11) at baseline and adherence {$>$}= 8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9 {$>$}= 11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1\% and 59.1\% accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.},

We describe the results of a nationwide survey of cardiovascular professionals regarding telehealth perspectives. Materials \& methods: A 31-question survey was sent early in the pandemic to assess the impact of COVID-19 on telehealth adoption \& reimbursement. Results: A total of 342 clinicians across 42 states participated. 77\% were using telehealth, with the majority initiating usage 2 months after the COVID-19 shutdown. A variety of video-based systems were used. Telehealth integration requirements differed, with electronic medical record integration being mandated in more urban than rural practices (70 vs 59\%; p {$<$} 0.005). Many implementation barriers surfaced, with over 75\% of respondents emphasizing reimbursement uncertainty and concerns for telehealth generalizability given the complexity of cardiovascular diseases. Conclusion: Substantial variation exists in telehealth practices. Further studies and legislation are needed to improve access, reimbursement and the quality of telehealth-based cardiovascular care. Plain language summary As the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning, the American College of Cardiology administered a survey to cardiology professionals across the USA regarding their preparedness for telehealth and video-visits. The results demonstrated rapid adoption of video based telehealth services, however revealed uncertainty for how to best use these services in different practice settings. Many providers expressed concerns about how these visits will be compensated, but fortunately federal agencies have dramatically changed the way telehealth is reimbursed as the pandemic has progressed. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of telehealth on healthcare inequality, however we hope that rather it serves to increase healthcare access to all.

  abstract = {Unsupervised machine learning methods are used to identify structural changes using the melting point transition in classical molecular dynamics simulations as an example application of the approach. Dimensionality reduction and clustering methods are applied to instantaneous radial distributions of atomic configurations from classical molecular dynamics simulations of metallic systems over a large temperature range. Principal component analysis is used to dramatically reduce the dimensionality of the feature space across the samples using an orthogonal linear transformation that preserves the statistical variance of the data under the condition that the new feature space is linearly independent. From there, k-means clustering is used to partition the samples into solid and liquid phases through a criterion motivated by the geometry of the reduced feature space of the samples, allowing for an estimation of the melting point transition. This pattern criterion is conceptually similar to how humans interpret the data but with far greater throughput, as the shapes of the radial distributions are different for each phase and easily distinguishable by humans. The transition temperature estimates derived from this machine learning approach produce comparable results to other methods on similarly small system sizes. These results show that machine learning approaches can be applied to structural changes in physical systems.},

An interesting question is whether it is possible to use a machine learning approach, in particular a neural network, for solving the many-body problem. In this paper, we present a neural network solver for the single impurity Anderson model, the paradigm of an interacting quantum problem in small clusters. We demonstrate that the neural-network-based solver provides quantitative accurate results for the spectral function as compared to the exact diagonalization method. This opens the possibility of utilizing the neural network approach as an impurity solver for other many-body numerical approaches, such as the dynamical mean field theory.},

The network is composed of two main sub-networks. The generator network learns to generate convincing Ising configurations and the discriminator network learns to discriminate between 'real' and 'fake' configurations with an additional categorical assignment prediction provided by an auxiliary network. Some of the predicted categorical assignments show agreement with the expected physical phases in the Ising model, the ferromagnetic spin-up and spin down phases as well as the high temperature weak external field phase. Additionally, configurations associated with the crossover phenomena are predicted by the model. The classification probabilities allow for a robust method of estimating the critical temperature in the vanishing field case, showing exceptional agreement with the known physics. This work indicates that a representation learning approach using an adversarial neural network can be used to identify categories that strongly resemble physical phases with no a priori information beyond raw physical configurations and the physical conditions they are subject to. Proper implementation of finite size scaling is essential for a complete machine learning approach in order to bring it in line with established statistical mechanics, which is worthwhile for future study.},

Genotyped adult patients (n = 894, 65.5\% women, age 18-75 years) diagnosed with mild-to-moderate MDD and treated with guided Internet-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) at the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Stockholm were included (2008-2016). Predictor types were demographic, clinical, process (e.g., time to complete online questionnaires), and genetic (polygenic risk scores). Outcome was remission status post ICBT (cut-off {$<$}= 10 on MADRS-S). Data were split into train (60\%) and validation (40\%) given ICBT start date. Predictor selection employed human expertise followed by recursive feature elimination. Model derivation was internally validated through cross-validation. The final random forest model was externally validated against a (i) null, (ii) logit, (iii) XGBoost, and \{iv) blended meta-ensemble model on the hold-out validation set. Feature selection retained 45 predictors representing all four predictor types. With unseen validation data, the final random forest model proved reasonably accurate at classifying post ICBT remission (Accuracy 0.656 [0.604, 0.705], P vs null model = 0.004; AUC 0.687 [0.631, 0.743]), slightly better vs logit (bootstrap D = 1.730, P = 0.084) but not vs XGBoost (D = 0.463, P = 0.643). Transparency analysis showed model usage of all predictor types at both the group and individual patient level. A new, multi-modal classifier for predicting MDD remission status after ICBT treatment in routine psychiatric care was derived and empirically validated. The multi-modal approach to predicting remission may inform tailored treatment, and deserves further investigation to attain clinical usefulness.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescents have high rates of nonfatal suicide attempts, but clinically practical risk prediction remains a challenge. Screening can be time consuming to implement at scale, if it is done at all. Computational algorithms may predict suicide risk using only routinely collected clinical data. We used a machine learning approach validated on longitudinal clinical data in adults to address this challenge in adolescents., METHODS: This is a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. Data were collected from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative from January 1998 to December 2015 and included 974 adolescents with nonfatal suicide attempts and multiple control comparisons: 496 adolescents with other self-injury (OSI), 7,059 adolescents with depressive symptoms, and 25,081 adolescent general hospital controls. Candidate predictors included diagnostic, demographic, medication, and socioeconomic factors. Outcome was determined by multiexpert review of electronic health records. Random forests were validated with optimism adjustment at multiple time points (from 1 week to 2 years). Recalibration was done via isotonic regression. Evaluation metrics included discrimination (AUC, sensitivity/specificity, precision/recall) and calibration (calibration plots, slope/intercept, Brier score)., RESULTS: Computational models performed well and did not require face-to-face screening. Performance improved as suicide attempts became more imminent. Discrimination was good in comparison with OSI controls (AUC = 0.83 [0.82-0.84] at 720 days; AUC = 0.85 [0.84-0.87] at 7 days) and depressed controls (AUC = 0.87 [95\% CI 0.85-0.90] at 720 days; 0.90 [0.85-0.94] at 7 days) and best in comparison with general hospital controls (AUC 0.94 [0.92-0.96] at 720 days; 0.97 [0.95-0.98] at 7 days). Random forests significantly outperformed logistic regression in every comparison. Recalibration improved performance as much as ninefold - clinical recommendations with poorly calibrated predictions can lead to decision errors., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning on longitudinal clinical data may provide a scalable approach to broaden screening for risk of nonfatal suicide attempts in adolescents.

The findings reveal that these five signals significantly increase healthcare practitioners' engagement, which subsequently leads to more favourable attitudes, greater satisfaction, and higher usage intentions with AI technology. Moreover, 'techno-overload' as a primary 'techno-stressor' moderates the mediating effect of engagement on the relationship between AI justice and behavioural and attitudinal outcomes. When healthcare practitioners perceive AI technology as adding extra workload, such techno-overload will undermine the importance of the justice signal and subsequently affect their attitudes, satisfaction, and usage intentions with AI technology.},

Support vector machines with various kernel functions may have different performances, as the kernels belong to two different types, the local kernels and the global kernels. So the composite kernel, which can bring more stable results and good precision in classification and regression, is an inevitable choice. To reduce the computational complexity of the kernel machine's online modeling, an unbiased least squares support vector regression model with composite kernel is proposed. The bias item of LSSVR is eliminated by improving the form of structure risk in this model, and then the calculating method of the regression coefficients is greatly simplified. Simultaneously, through introducing the composite kernel to the LSSVM, the model can easily adapt to the irregular variation of the chaotic time series. Considering the real-time performance, an online learning algorithm based on Cholesky factorization is designed according to the characteristic of extended kernel function matrix. Experimental results indicate that the unbiased composite kernel LSSVR is effective and suitable for online time series with both the steep variations and the smooth variations, as it can well track the dynamic character of the series with good prediction precisions, better generalization and stability. The algorithm can also save much computation time comparing to those methods using matrix inversion, although there is a little more loss in time than that with the usage of single kernels.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the quality of clinical order practice patterns machine-learned from clinician cohorts stratified by patient mortality outcomes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inpatient electronic health records from 2010 to 2013 were extracted from a tertiary academic hospital. Clinicians (n=1822) were stratified into low-mortality (21.8\%, n=397) and high-mortality (6.0\%, n=110) extremes using a two-sided P-value score quantifying deviation of observed vs. expected 30-day patient mortality rates. Three patient cohorts were assembled: patients seen by low-mortality clinicians, high-mortality clinicians, and an unfiltered crowd of all clinicians (n=1046, 1046, and 5230 post-propensity score matching, respectively). Predicted order lists were automatically generated from recommender system algorithms trained on each patient cohort and evaluated against (i) real-world practice patterns reflected in patient cases with better-than-expected mortality outcomes and (ii) reference standards derived from clinical practice guidelines., RESULTS: Across six common admission diagnoses, order lists learned from the crowd demonstrated the greatest alignment with guideline references (AUROC range=0.86-0.91), performing on par or better than those learned from low-mortality clinicians (0.79-0.84, P{$<$}10-5) or manually-authored hospital order sets (0.65-0.77, P{$<$}10-3). The same trend was observed in evaluating model predictions against better-than-expected patient cases, with the crowd model (AUROC mean=0.91) outperforming the low-mortality model (0.87, P{$<$}10-16) and order set benchmarks (0.78, P{$<$}10-35)., DISCUSSION: Whether machine-learning models are trained on all clinicians or a subset of experts illustrates a bias-variance tradeoff in data usage. Defining robust metrics to assess quality based on internal (e.g. practice patterns from better-than-expected patient cases) or external reference standards (e.g. clinical practice guidelines) is critical to assess decision support content., CONCLUSION: Learning relevant decision support content from all clinicians is as, if not more, robust than learning from a select subgroup of clinicians favored by patient outcomes.

To develop a PPD prediction model, using EHRs from Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital between 2015-17, 9,980 episodes of pregnancy were identified. Six machine learning algorithms, including L2-regularized Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random forest were constructed. Our model's best prediction performance achieved an AUC of 0.79. Race, obesity, anxiety, depression, different types of pain, antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy were among the significant predictors. Our results suggest a potential for applying machine learning to EHR data to predict PPD and inform healthcare delivery.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study assessesA whether neural networks trained on electronic health record (EHR) data can anticipate what individual clinical orders and existing institutional order set templates clinicians will use more accurately than existing decision support tools. Materials and Methods: We process 57 624 patients worth of clinical event EHR data from 2008 to 2014. We train a feed-forward neural network (ClinicNet) and logistic regression applied to the traditional problem structure of predicting individual clinical items as well as our proposed workflow of predicting existing institutional order set template usage. Results: ClinicNet predicts individual clinical orders (precision = 0.32, recall = 0.47) better than existing institutional order sets (precision = 0.15, recall = 0.46). The ClinicNet model predicts clinician usage of existing institutional order sets (avg. precision = 0.31) with higher average precision than a baseline of order set usage frequencies (avg. precision = 0.20) or a logistic regression model (avg. precision = 0.12). Discussion: Machine learning methods can predict clinical decision-making patterns with greater accuracy and less manual effort than existing static order set templates. This can streamline existing clinical workflows, but may not fit if historical clinical ordering practices are incorrect. For this reason, manually authored content such as order set templates remain valuable for the purposeful design of care pathways. ClinicNet's capability of predicting such personalized order set templates illustrates the potential of combining both top-down and bottomup approaches to delivering clinical decision support content. Conclusion: ClinicNet illustrates the capability for machine learning methods applied to the EHR to anticipate both individual clinical orders and existing order set templates, which has the potential to improve upon current standards of practice in clinical order entry.},

  abstract = {Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of pediatric acquired heart disease. Coronary artery abnormalities are the main complication of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease patients with intravenous immunoglobulin resistance are at a greater risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities. Several scoring models have been established to predict resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin, but clinicians usually do not apply those models in patients because of their poor performance. To find a better model, we retrospectively collected data including 753 observations and 82 variables. A total of 644 observations were included in the analysis, and 124 of the patients observed were intravenous immunoglobulin resistant (19.25\%). We considered 7 different linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (L1 and L1 regularized), decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and lightGBM, to predict the class of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance (binary classification). Data from patients who were discharged before Sep 2018 were included in the training set (n = 497), while all the data collected after 9/1/2018 were included in the test set (n = 147). We used the area under the ROC curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the performances of each model. The gradient GBM had the best performance (area under the ROC curve 0.7423, accuracy 0.8844, sensitivity 0.3043, specificity 0.9919). Additionally, the feature importance was evaluated with SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values, and the clinical utility was assessed with decision curve analysis. We also compared our model with the Kobayashi score, Egami score, Formosa score and Kawamura score. Our machine learning model outperformed all of the aforementioned four scoring models. Our study demonstrates a novel and robust machine learning method to predict intravenous immunoglobulin resistance in Kawasaki disease patients. We believe this approach could be implemented in an electronic health record system as a form of clinical decision support in the near future.},

However, integration of global covariance pooling into deep CNNs brings two challenges: (1) robust covariance estimation given deep features of high dimension and small sample size; (2) appropriate usage of geometry of covariances. To address these challenges, we propose a global Matrix Power Normalized COVariance (MPN-COV) Pooling. Our MPN-COV conforms to a robust covariance estimator, very suitable for scenario of high dimension and small sample size. It can also be regarded as Power-Euclidean metric between covariances, effectively exploiting their geometry. Furthermore, a global Gaussian embedding network is proposed to incorporate first-order statistics into MPN-COV. For fast training of MPN-COV networks, we implement an iterative matrix square root normalization, avoiding GPU unfriendly eigen-decomposition inherent in MPN-COV. Additionally, progressive 1 x 1 convolutions and group convolution are introduced to compress covariance representations. The proposed methods are highly modular, readily plugged into existing deep CNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale object classification, scene categorization, fine-grained visual recognition and texture classification, showing our methods outperform the counterparts and obtain state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {This research consisted of two studies to investigate how the Chinese rural educational system supported students' online learning and to determine the factors that influenced students' online learning quality (satisfaction and cognitive and social presence) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1, based on interviews with three curriculum officers, seven principals and 30 course teachers, found that great efforts were made to realize digital equity and education for all students. The necessity of providing resources and support to teachers and students (facilitating conditions) was recognized, along with the importance of teachers' online course design and organization and the facilitation of discourse (teaching presence and social presence). Based on the findings of Study 1 and the literature review, a conceptual model of facilitating conditions and teaching presence reported to influence students' online learning quality was generated. In Study 2, 1,409 students from three rural primary schools were surveyed to test the conceptual model. The results indicated that facilitating conditions influenced students' online learning quality through enhanced technology self-efficacy and perceived usefulness. Teaching presence directly and positively predicted students' online learning quality. This research highlights the importance of creating a learning community and providing technology access and support to ensure online learning opportunities and quality for rural students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Chinese students from rural or migrant schools have fewer opportunities to access computers and the Internet, lower frequencies of online activity and technology self-efficacy and less training and parental and teacher support. Providing support and resources to encourage and facilitate technology use among teachers and students in rural and underdeveloped schools is of great importance. Identifying the factors that contribute to online learning quality among rural school students to tackle the transition to online learning is necessary. What this paper adds The rural government and schools have made great efforts to ensure digital equity and education for all students, despite family conditions. Facilitating purposeful interactions and providing timely feedback is critical for effective learning in online teaching. Facilitating conditions represented by available support and resources and teaching presence influence students' online learning quality in rural areas. Implications for practice and/or policy Providing digital equipment and resources to all students is the first step towards distance learning. Providing opportunities to improve teachers' digital competency is critical for providing quality online instruction. Providing students timely assistance and useful and learner-friendly technologies to enhance their satisfaction and social and cognitive presence is necessary. Online instructors should create a friendly online learning environment, facilitate active discussion and purposeful reflection and create opportunities to promote students' open communication, group cohesion and meaning construction.},

  abstract = {Owing to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there has been increasing concern about how to promote the use of AI technologies in school settings to enhance students' learning performance. Teachers' intention to adopt AI tools in their classes plays a crucial role in this regard. Therefore, it is important to explore factors affecting teachers' intention to incorporate AI technologies or applications into course designs in higher education. In this study, a structural equation modeling approach was employed to investigate teachers' continuance intention to teach with AI. In the proposed model, 10 hypotheses regarding anxiety (AN), self-efficacy (SE), attitude towards Al (ATU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU) were tested, and this study explored how these factors worked together to influence teachers' continuance intention. A total of 311 teachers in higher education participated in the study. Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the five endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 70.4\% of the changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of BI. The total effect of ATU was 0.793, followed by SE, with a total effect of 0.554. As a result, the intentions of teachers to learn to use AI-based applications in their teaching can be predicted by ATU, SE, PEU, PU and AN. Among them, teachers' SE positively influenced teachers' PEU and ATU towards adopting AI-based applications, and also influenced PU through PEU. In addition, the relationship between teachers' SE and AN was negatively correlated, which indicated that enhancing teachers' SE could reduce their AN towards using AI-based applications in their teaching. Accordingly, implications and suggestions for researchers and school teachers are provided.},

PhenoPad is an intelligent clinical note-taking interface that captures free-form notes and standard phenotypic information via a variety of modalities, including speech and natural language processing techniques, handwriting recognition, and more. The output is unobtrusively presented on mobile devices to clinicians for real-time validation and can be automatically transformed into digital formats that would be compatible with integration into electronic health record systems. Semi-structured interviews and trials in clinical settings rendered positive feedback from both clinicians and patients, demonstrating that AI-enabled clinical note-taking under our design improves ease and breadth of information captured during clinical visits without compromising patient-clinician interactions.

A multi-step process of machine learning approaches was performed to develop and validate the prognostic and predictive potential of the GCSC-related score (GCScore). The high GCScore subgroup was not only associated with stem cell characteristics, but also with a potential immune escape mechanism. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrated the upregulated infiltration of CD206(+) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the invasive margin region, which in turn maintained the stem cell properties of tumor cells. Finally, we proposed that the GCScore showed a robust capacity for prediction for immunotherapy, and investigated potential therapeutic targets and compounds for patients with a high GCScore. The results indicate that the proposed GCScore can be a promising predictor of prognosis and responses to immunotherapy, which provides new strategies for the precision treatment of GCSCs.},

However, data protection regulations prohibit data centralisation for analysis purposes because of potential privacy risks like the accidental disclosure of data to third parties. Therefore, alternative data usage policies, which comply with present privacy guidelines, are of particular interest. Objective We aim to enable analyses on sensitive patient data by simultaneously complying with local data protection regulations using an approach called the Personal Health Train (PHT), which is a paradigm that utilises distributed analytics (DA) methods. The main principle of the PHT is that the analytical task is brought to the data provider and the data instances remain in their original location. Methods In this work, we present our implementation of the PHT paradigm, which preserves the sovereignty and autonomy of the data providers and operates with a limited number of communication channels. We further conduct a DA use case on data stored in three different and distributed data providers. Results We show that our infrastructure enables the training of data models based on distributed data sources. Conclusion Our work presents the capabilities of DA infrastructures in the health care sector, which lower the regulatory obstacles of sharing patient data. We further demonstrate its ability to fuel medical science by making distributed data sets available for scientists or health care practitioners.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Large multi-domain, multi-resolution timeseries datasets, prevalent in applications from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decision support in intensive care, are particularly challenging to distribute for review, analysis, and annotation by experts due to their size, bandwidth limitations, and the need for specialized software to process them. Yet these datasets are foundational to AI-augmented decision support in data-rich clinical environments. The ability to interactively reveal useful information and prepare it for training AI models is required to reap benefits of using such data in practice. Objectives. We present an open-source, versatile, scalable, portable, web-based interactive tool for AI researchers and clinicians to interactively analyze large multivariate time series datasets. Methods. We built an open-source web-based tool for viewing, analyzing, and annotating large, multi-domain time series datasets [1], and applied it to electronic health record and telemetry data. The tool handles arbitrarily large amounts of data and performs efficiently over standard internet connections. It optimizes usage of computer memory and user query response vs. amount of data storage. Multi-resolution representations are computed upon loading the data, enabling browsing it at interactive speeds. Files are stored in interoperable HDF5 [2]-based AUData [3] or CCDEF [4] formats. Efficiencies of design and data management enable the tool to run on common computer hardware. A clinically intuitive web-based graphical user interface is portable and can be used on a local computer or by remote clients on any operating system with a web browser and network connection. Results. The tool serves three main functions: review, analysis, and annotation. For review, it presents time series graphically using a customizable user interface allowing for rapidly panning and zooming to any timescale desired. For analysis, the tool has a well-documented application programming interface through which analysts can manage projects and files, run analyses, browse results, and create pattern sets and annotation assignments. An extendable library of analytic functions includes configurable exceedance detection and signal quality assessment functions. The tool is currently used to support team-based clinical data annotation for training AI models in applications including bedside artifactual alert adjudication, forecasting cardio- respiratory insufficiency, and phenotyping response to stress and treatment in intensive care medicine. Conclusion. The Auton Universal Viewer (AUViewer) [5] is an opensource tool designed to accelerate reviewing, analyzing, and annotating large multi-domain multi-resolution time series data, thus making data accessible, interoperable, and reusable [6].

Anxious or trauma-exposed brains are characterized by dysregulated neural activations within regions of this fear network. In this study, we examined how the functional MRI activations of 10 brain regions commonly activated during fear conditioning and extinction might distinguish anxious or trauma-exposed brains from controls. To achieve this, activations during four phases of a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in 304 participants with or without a psychiatric diagnosis were studied. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using task-specific brain activations, we reliably distinguished the anxious and trauma-exposed brains from controls. The performance of models decreased significantly when we trained our CNN using activations from task-irrelevant brain regions or from a brain network that is irrelevant to fear. Our results suggest that neuroimaging data analytics of task-induced brain activations within the fear network might provide novel prospects for development of brain-based psychiatric diagnosis.},

Methods FLIm was integrated into transoral robotic surgery to acquire optical data on six HNSCCUP patients' oropharyngeal tissues. An additional 55-patient FLIm dataset, comprising conventional primary tumors, trained a machine learning classifier; the output predicted the presence and location of HNSCCUP for the six patients. Validation was performed using histopathology. Results Among the six HNSCCUP patients, p16+ occult primary was surgically identified in three patients, whereas three patients ultimately had no identifiable primary site in the oropharynx. FLIm correctly detected HNSCCUP in all three patients (ROC-AUC: 0.90 +/- 0.06), and correctly predicted benign oropharyngeal tissue for the remaining three patients. The mean sensitivity was 95\% +/- 3.5\%, and specificity 89\% +/- 12.7\%. Conclusions FLIm may be a useful diagnostic adjunct for detecting HNSCCUP.},

  abstract = {Background The literature paints a complex picture of the association between mortality risk and ICU strain. In this study, we sought to determine if there is an association between mortality risk in intensive care units (ICU) and occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, as a proxy for strain. Methods A national retrospective observational cohort study of 89 English hospital trusts (i.e. groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units). Seven thousand one hundred thirty-three adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2 April and 1 December, 2020 (inclusive), with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria. A Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible), bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation index, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded chronic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, liver disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, neurological disease, renal disease). Results One hundred thirty-five thousand six hundred patient days were observed, with a mortality rate of 19.4 per 1000 patient days. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy ({$>$} 85\% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 to 85\%) [OR 1.23 (95\% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.08 to 1.39)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy ({$<$} 45\% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.83 (95\% PCI 0.75 to 0.94)]. Conclusion Increasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Further research is required to establish if this is a causal relationship or whether it reflects strain on other operational factors such as staff. If causal, the result highlights the importance of strategies to keep ICU occupancy low to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.},

The introduction of elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and systems which are using AI makes this already complex topic even more challenging. The introduction of so-called dynamic AI or dynamic machine learning (ML) algorithms in this respect represents a turning point. Unlike conventional medical devices, the development of systems using dynamic AI is not yet complete at the beginning of the clinical application. The aim of a dynamic AI system is to continuously improve through practical use and by the processing of usage data. This continuous evolution, along with the lack of transparency regarding internal work processes, could make it difficult to understand the underlying rationale for the assessments made by the algorithms. This aspect affects the acceptance of the technology both by clinicians and patients and furthermore questions the autonomy of patients and clinicians in the course of the treatment process. A way out of this ethical and regulatory dilemma must urgently be found and will require extreme efforts from all stakeholders. At present, no consensual solution is apparent. What is quite certain, however, is that users, i.e. in concrete terms surgeons, must play a much more active role than they have done in the past when dealing with AI-based medical devices and should prepare themselves to actively accompany the software life cycle of AI technologies.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers. Objective: The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system. Methods: To accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature. Results: The environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI. Conclusions: Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

  abstract = {Background Visual data are particularly amenable for machine learning techniques. With clinical photography established for skin surveillance and documentation purposes as well as progress checks, dermatology is an ideal field for the development and application of emerging machine learning health care applications (ML-HCAs). To date, several ML-HCAs have detected malignant skin lesions on par with experts or found overlooked visual patterns that correlate with certain dermatological diseases. However, it is well established that ML-HCAs come with ethical and social implications. Objectives Currently, there is a lack of research that establishes model design, training, usage and regulation of such technologies sufficient to ensure ethically and socially responsible development and clinical translation, specifically within the field of dermatology. With this paper, we aim to give an overview of currently discussed ethical issues relating to dermatological ML-HCAs. Methods On the basis of a thematic, keyword-based literature search, we performed an ethical analysis against established frameworks of biomedical ethics. We combined our results with current, relevant normative machine learning ethics literature to identify the status quo of the ethics of ML-HCAs in dermatology. We describe the benefits and risks of dermatological ML-HCAs that are currently being developed for clinical purposes. Results The potential benefits range from better patient outcomes to better knowledge accessibility to decreasing health care disparities, that is, standards of care between different population groups. The risks associated with ML-HCAs range from confidentiality issues to individual patient outcomes as well as the exacerbation of prevalent health care disparities. We discuss the practical implications for all stages of dermatological ML-HCA development. Conclusion We found that ML-HCAs present stakeholder-specific risks for patients, health care professionals and society, which need to be considered separately. The discipline lacks sufficient biomedical ethics research that could standardize the approach to ML-HCA model design, training, use and regulation of such technologies.},

DESIGN: A pragmatic pre- A nd post-intervention study conducted over the same 10-month period in 2 consecutive years. SETTING: Four-hospital community-academic health system. PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted to a medical-surgical ward. INTERVENTIONS: During the baseline period, clinicians were blinded to eCART scores. During the intervention period, scores were presented to providers. Scores greater than or equal to 95th percentile were designated high risk prompting a physician assessment for ICU admission. Scores between the 89th and 95th percentiles were designated intermediate risk, triggering a nurse-directed workflow that included measuring vital signs every 2 hours and contacting a physician to review the treatment plan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was all-cause inhospital mortality. Secondary measures included vital sign assessment within 2 hours, ICU transfer rate, and time to ICU transfer. A total of 60,261 patients were admitted during the study period, of which 6,681 (11.1\%) met inclusion criteria (baseline period n = 3,191, intervention period n = 3,490). The intervention period was associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality for the main cohort (8.8\% vs 13.9\%; p {$<$} 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95\% CI, 0.52-0.71]). A significant decrease in mortality was also seen for the average-risk cohort not subject to the intervention (0.49\% vs 0.26\%; p {$<$} 0.05; adjusted OR, 0.53 [95\% CI, 0.41-0.74]). In subgroup analysis, the benefit was seen in both high-(17.9\% vs 23.9\%; p = 0.001) and intermediate-risk (2.0\% vs 4.0 \%; p = 0.005) patients. The intervention period was also associated with a significant increase in ICU transfers, decrease in time to ICU transfer, and increase in vital sign reassessment within 2 hours. CONCLUSION(S): Implementation of a machine learning early warning score-driven protocol was associated with reduced inhospital mortality, likely driven by earlier and more frequent ICU transfer.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published clinical datasets are important part of medical research. By combining results of multiple studies, meta-analysis is able to increase confidence in its conclusions, validate particular study results, and sometimes lead to new findings. Extensive theory has been built on how to aggregate results from multiple studies and arrive to the statistically valid conclusions. Surprisingly, very little has been done to adopt advanced machine learning methods to support meta-analysis., METHODS: In this paper we describe a novel machine learning methodology that is capable of inducing accurate and easy to understand attributional rules from aggregated data. Thus, the methodology can be used to support traditional meta-analysis in systematic reviews. Most machine learning applications give primary attention to predictive accuracy of the learned knowledge, and lesser attention to its understandability. Here we employed attributional rules, the special form of rules that are relatively easy to interpret for medical experts who are not necessarily trained in statistics and meta-analysis., RESULTS: The methodology has been implemented and initially tested on a set of publicly available clinical data describing patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective of this application was to determine rules describing combinations of clinical parameters used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis, and to develop rules for predicting whether particular patients are likely to develop secondary complications of MS. The aggregated clinical data was retrieved from 20 separate hospital cohorts that included 12 groups of patients with present liver disease symptoms and 8 control groups of healthy subjects. The total of 152 attributes were used, most of which were measured, however, in different studies. Twenty most common attributes were selected for the rule learning process. By applying the developed rule learning methodology we arrived at several different possible rulesets that can be used to predict three considered complications of MS, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), simple steatosis (SS), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).},

  abstract = {Introduction: Human IVF technology may require a sequence of fresh and frozen embryo transfer cycles to achieve conception and live birth. Given the finite, often limiting number of high-quality fertilized oocytes retrieved from patients, the multistep decision of how many and which embryos to transfer on each cycle becomes crucial for shortening time to pregnancy while avoiding clinical complications associated with multiple pregnancy. We hypothesize that a multistep, look-ahead approach can identify the optimal embryo transfer strategy and improve IVF outcome. Method(s): Using dynamic programming, we developed an online decisionsupport tool that surveys all possible embryo transfer combinations at each step as defined by the given cohort of a patient's embryos, and scores the expected action outcome (EAO). For each possible action (transfer one, two or three embryos), the EAO scores the potential to conceive combined with penalties due to multiple pregnancy and time to pregnancy by integrating the future actions allowed by all possible strategies. The potential to conceive depends on the assessments of embryo quality and endometrial receptivity - the latter is computationally adjusted in real time based on the outcome of previous transfers. Embeyo quality can be assessed using various methods chosen by the user. Here we present machine learning and automated deep learning algorithms that predict the potential to reach important developmental milestones: blastulation, implantation, avoiding 1st trimester miscarriage and live birth. Finally, EAO scoring also allows a physician evaluation of embryo freezing effects and related patient-specific medical risks. Result(s): The medical utility of our decision-support tool is demonstrated retrospectively using an expansive database of IVF treatments collected from five medical centers. It includes time-lapse videos, maternal information, embryo transfer statistics, chemical and clinical pregnancy measurements, miscarriage and live birth outcome for {$>$}20,000 embryos and 5,400 transfer cycles. For each medical center we identify a distinctive embryo-transfer policy applied to all patients, rather than a patient-specific strategy. We retrospectively quantify the distances between the transfer decisions made by the physicians and the optimal actions defined by the decision-support tool. A negative correlation between these distances and implantation outcome will support accuracy and clinical utility. Conclusion(s): The multistep embryo transfer decision-making process can be projected onto a graph and solved analytically using dynamic programming. Clinical adoption of established computational tools has the potential to implement a personalized-care approach, shorten time to pregnancy, minimize health risks and improve live-birth rates.},

  abstract = {Introduction There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.},

Methods and Materials: A single center retrospective study was performed in Tin Shui Wai Hospital. PDR in CLN from 11/2020 to 03/2021 after the application of ENDO-AID (AI group) was compared to the cases from 12/2019 to 11/2020 before the application of the practice (non-Al group). Procedures were performed by a single endoscopist with experience in performing {$>$} 3,000 CLN. Variables, such as patients' demographic data, indications, incidence of PDR, Boston Bowel Preparation Scale BBPS, withdrawal time, post CLN complication rate between the 2 groups, were compared. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed by using the Chi-Square test (Fisher exact test if appropriate) and Mann-Whitney test respectively. Results were considered to be significant if p-value {$<$} 0.05. Results: Total 234 patients were recruited. 115 patients (49.1\%) were in the non-AI group while 119 patients (50.9\%) were in the AI group. The mean age of the non-AI was higher than the AI group (65.3 vs 59.2, p{$<$} 0.001*), otherwise, there was no significant difference in sex (p = 0.05), percentage of smokers (20.8\% vs 27.7\%, p = 0.22), past medical history of IBD (0 vs 0, p = 1.0), family history of colorectal cancer (9 vs 9, p = 0.94), indications for CLN (e.g. follow up CLN for polyp/ cancer, per-rectal bleeding, altered bowel habit etc. p {$>$} 0.05), BBPS (7.88 vs 8.04, p = 0.217), withdrawal time (7.65 min vs 7.48 min, p = 0.935), completion rate (95.6\% vs 98.3\%, p = 0.27) and complication rate (0\% in both groups,p=1.0) between groups. In the contrary, PDR was significantly higher in the AI group than the non-AI group (64.7\% vs 46.0\%, p = 0.003*). Besides, adenoma detection rate was also found significantly higher in the AI group than the non-AI group (52.9\% vs 37.4\%, p = 0.017*). Conclusions: AI CLN can improve the PDR.},

  abstract = {Introduction Current international guidelines recommend ECG monitoring after an ischaemic stroke to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in order to prevent stroke recurrence. However, optimal strategies to detect AF and the downstream management to prevent stroke recurrence remain to be established. The objective of the study was to explore the use of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in patients with a history of stroke. Methods and analysis This prospective, randomised, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication aimed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term home-based ECG monitoring for AF detection and stroke prevention in a 24-month period. Patients aged {$>$}18 years with a history of ischaemic stroke will be stratified according to the time from the index ischaemic stroke: {$<$}1, 1-3 and {$>$}3 years and then randomised in 1:1 to (1) home-based AF screening and (2) control. The home-based AF screening system comprises (1) a handheld single-lead ECG recorder (Comfit Healthcare Devices, Hong Kong SAR, China) and (2) a patient-facing smartphone application specially designed for the study. Patients randomised to the home-based AF group will record a 30 s single-lead ECG using a specially designed handheld ECG device every morning or when symptomatic. All remotely obtained data will be automatically transmitted in real-time through the study smartphone application to a secured cloud hosting and analysed using an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system. When a diagnosis of AF is made with the system, the patients will be called back for a formal cardiology consultation within 1 week. The primary endpoint is the time to first detection of AF at 24 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include recurrent stroke or transient ischaemic attack, initiation of long-term anticoagulation therapy, hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death and all-cause death. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of The University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong West Cluster, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong SAR, China. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.},

When applied appropriately, machine learning tools can augment clinical care provided to patients. However, even if a model has impressive performance characteristics, prospectively evaluating and effectively implementing models into clinical care remains difficult. The primary objective of this paper is to recount our experiences and challenges in comparing a novel machine learning-based clinical decision support tool to legacy, non-machine learning tools addressing potential safety events in the hospitals and to summarize the obstacles which prevented evaluation of clinical efficacy of tools prior to widespread institutional use. We collected and compared safety events data, specifically patient falls and pressure injuries, between the standard of care approach and machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support (CDS). Our assessment was limited to performance of the model rather than the workflow due to challenges in directly comparing both approaches. We did note a modest improvement in falls with ML-based CDS; however, it was not possible to determine that overall improvement was due to model characteristics.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n=309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity, and related differentially to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline rsEEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent TMS/EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has projected that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third-leading cause of mortality and the seventh-leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life, and higher mortality. Accurate early detection of acute exacerbations will enable early management and reduce mortality., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction system using lifestyle data, environmental factors, and patient symptoms for the early detection of AECOPD in the upcoming 7 days., METHODS: This prospective study was performed at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients with COPD that did not have a pacemaker and were not pregnant were invited for enrollment. Data on lifestyle, temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter were collected using wearable devices (Fitbit Versa), a home air quality-sensing device (EDIMAX Airbox), and a smartphone app. AECOPD episodes were evaluated via standardized questionnaires. With these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of machine learning models, including random forest, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, and adaptive boosting, and a deep neural network model., RESULTS: The continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and indoor environment factors was implemented by integrating home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and wearable devices. All data from 67 COPD patients were collected prospectively during a mean 4-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 25 AECOPD episodes. For 7-day AECOPD prediction, the proposed AECOPD predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92.1\%, sensitivity of 94\%, and specificity of 90.4\%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the model in predicting AECOPD was greater than 0.9. The most important variables in the model were daily steps walked, stairs climbed, and daily distance moved., CONCLUSIONS: Using wearable devices, home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and supervised prediction algorithms, we achieved excellent power to predict whether a patient would experience AECOPD within the upcoming 7 days. The AECOPD prediction system provided an effective way to collect lifestyle and environmental data, and yielded reliable predictions of future AECOPD events. Compared with previous studies, we have comprehensively improved the performance of the AECOPD prediction model by adding objective lifestyle and environmental data. This model could yield more accurate prediction results for COPD patients than using only questionnaire data.

The proposed innovative mediated-moderation model includes second-order factors derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM) (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment), the attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction (ARCS) model, and cognitive load (mental load and mental effort) to explain the continuous learning intention of STEAM education. Results A teaching material was designed for the STEAM activity, and an empirical experiment was subsequently conducted. The empirical experiment of STEAM activities with our design teaching material (micro:bit with artificial intelligence-based concept) was conducted at a university and an elementary school; a total of 145 questionnaire survey data were collected after the activities. University student participants were 20-24 years old and the elementary school student participants were at the K5-K6 level. The results showed that perceived usability directly influenced learning intention and strengthened the relationship between learning attitudes and intention. The ARCS plays a critical moderating role that positively influenced perceived usability and strengthened its effects on learning attitudes. Regarding the mediating effects, cognitive load negatively influenced perceived usability. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed that critical factors affect students' learning attitudes and intentions regarding STEAM education. The theoretical and educational implications of these findings were proposed to future instructors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) are designed to solve knowledge-intensive tasks for supporting decision-making processes. Although many approaches for designing CDSS have been proposed, due to high implementation costs, as well as the lack of interoperability features, current solutions are not well-established across different institutions. Recently, the use of standardized formalisms for knowledge representation as terminologies as well as the integration of semantically enriched clinical information models, as openEHR Archetypes, and their reuse within CDSS are theoretically considered as key factors for reusable CDSS., OBJECTIVE: We aim at developing and evaluating an openEHR based approach to achieve interoperability in CDSS by designing and implementing an exemplary system for automated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) detection in pediatric intensive care., METHODS: We designed an interoperable concept, which enables an easy integration of the CDSS across different institutions, by using openEHR Archetypes, terminology bindings and the Archetype Query Language (AQL). The practicability of the approach was tested by (1) implementing a prototype, which is based on an openEHR based data repository of the Hannover Medical School (HaMSTR), and (2) conducting a first pilot study., RESULTS: We successfully designed and implemented a CDSS with interoperable knowledge bases and interfaces by reusing internationally agreed-upon Archetypes, incorporating LOINC terminology and creating AQL queries, which allowed retrieving dynamic facts in a standardized and unambiguous form. The technical capabilities of the system were evaluated by testing the prototype on 16 randomly selected patients with 129 days of stay, and comparing the results with the assessment of clinical experts (leading to a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.94 and a Cohen's kappa of 0.92)., CONCLUSIONS: We found the use of openEHR Archetypes and AQL a feasible approach to bridge the interoperability gap between local infrastructures and CDSS. The designed concept was successfully transferred into a clinically evaluated openEHR based CDSS. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first openEHR based CDSS, which is technically reliable and capable in a real context, and facilitates clinical decision-support for a complex task. Further activities will comprise enrichments of the knowledge base, the reasoning processes and cross-institutional evaluations. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The design of computerized systems able to support automated detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research., OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches., METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers., RESULTS: The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80\% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50\% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62\% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33\%. Sepsis is covered in 67\% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4\%, whereas 27\% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories "algorithm used" and "support type" are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38\%) and diagnosis coding (29\%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31\%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90\%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in routine settings are missing in nearly all articles., CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives.

  abstract = {The technology for evaluating patient-provider interactions in psychotherapy–observational coding–has not changed in 70 years. It is labor-intensive, error prone, and expensive, limiting its use in evaluating psychotherapy in the real world. Engineering solutions from speech and language processing provide new methods for the automatic evaluation of provider ratings from session recordings. The primary data are 200 Motivational Interviewing (MI) sessions from a study on MI training methods with observer ratings of counselor empathy. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) was used to transcribe sessions, and the resulting words were used in a text-based predictive model of empathy. Two supporting datasets trained the speech processing tasks including ASR (1200 transcripts from heterogeneous psychotherapy sessions and 153 transcripts and session recordings from 5 MI clinical trials). The accuracy of computationally-derived empathy ratings were evaluated against human ratings for each provider. Computationally-derived empathy scores and classifications (high vs. low) were highly accurate against human-based codes and classifications, with a correlation of 0.65 and F-score (a weighted average of sensitivity and specificity) of 0.86, respectively. Empathy prediction using human transcription as input (as opposed to ASR) resulted in a slight increase in prediction accuracies, suggesting that the fully automatic system with ASR is relatively robust. Using speech and language processing methods, it is possible to generate accurate predictions of provider performance in psychotherapy from audio recordings alone. This technology can support large-scale evaluation of psychotherapy for dissemination and process studies.},

Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring.

Given the developing nature of NMT tools, this can pose safety risks to multicultural communities with limited bilingual skills, low education, and low health literacy. Research is needed to scrutinise the reliability, credibility, usability of automatically translated patient health information.Objective: We aimed to develop high-performing Bayesian machine learning classifiers to assist clinical professionals and healthcare workers in assessing the quality and usability of NMT on depressive disorders. The tool did not require any prior knowledge from frontline health and medical professionals of the target language used by patients.Methods: We used Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to increase generalisability and clinical interpretability of classifiers. It is a typical sparse Bayesian classifier less prone to overfitting with small training datasets. We optimised RVM by leveraging automatic recursive feature elimination and expert feature refinement from the perspective of health linguistics. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the Bayesian classifier under different probability cut-offs in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios against clinical thresholds for diagnostic tests. Finally, we illustrated interpretation of RVM tool in clinic using Bayes' nomogram.Results: After automatic and expert-based feature optimisation, the best-performing RVM classifier (RVM\_DUFS12) gained the highest AUC (0.8872) among 52 competing models with distinct optimised, normalised features sets. It also had statistically higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other models. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the best-performing model using Bayes' nomogram: it had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 4.62 (95\% C.I.: 2.53, 8.43), and the associated posterior probability (odds) was 83\% (5.0) (95\% C.I.: 73\%, 90\%), meaning that approximately 10 in 12 English texts with positive test are likely to contain information that would cause clinically significant conceptual errors if translated by Google; it had a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.18 (95\% C.I.: 0.10,0.35) and associated posterior probability (odds) was 16\% (0.2) (95\% C.I: 10\%, 27\%), meaning that about 10 in 12 English texts with negative test can be safely translated using Google.},

Nine focus groups were done to collect in-depth insights and comprehensive viewpoints respectively from Chinese families, local device providers, and public healthcare organisations. The qualitative data collected was analysed by using a thematic analysis approach. The results showed a set of 16 crucial barriers related to diverse technological, managerial, clinical, financial, legal and personal aspects. amongst these, lack of collaboration between WMD providers and public health organizations was identified to be the most critical barrier. This challenge was triggered by a range of clinical, financial, legal, managerial, and technical reasons, and would substantially prevent large-scale deployment and usage of AI-enabled wearable medical devices in the Chinese context},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Depressive disorder is one of the major public health problems among the elderly. An effective depression risk prediction model can provide insights on the disease progression and potentially inform timely targeted interventions. Therefore, research on predicting the onset of depressive disorder for elderly adults considering the sequential progression patterns is critically needed., OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for the individualized prediction of depressive disorder with a 22-year longitudinal survey data among elderly people in the United States., METHODS: We obtain the 22-year longitudinal survey data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, which consists of information on 20,000 elderly people in the United States from 1992 to 2014. To capture temporal and high-order interactions among risk factors, the proposed deep learning model utilizes a recurrent neural network framework with a multitask structure. The C-statistic and the mean absolute error are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model and a set of baseline models., RESULTS: The experiments with the 22-year longitudinal survey data indicate that (a) machine learning models can provide an accurate prediction of the onset of depressive disorder for elderly individuals; (b) the temporal patterns of risk factors are associated with the onset of depressive disorder; and (c) the proposed multitask deep learning model exhibits superior performance as compared with baseline models., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the capability of deep learning-based prediction models in capturing temporal and high-order interactions among risk factors, which are usually ignored by traditional regression models. This research sheds light on the use of machine learning models to predict the onset of depressive disorder among elderly people. Practically, the proposed methods can be implemented as a decision support system to help clinicians make decisions and inform actionable intervention strategies for elderly people.

Methods and Materials. 128 patients with cervical cancer were treated with definitive pelvic radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy followed by image-guided brachytherapy. The elastic-net models with integrating DVH parameters and baseline clinical factors, only DVH parameters and only baseline clinical factors were constructed in 5-folds cross-validations for 100 iteration bootstrapping, and then were compared using concordance index (C-index) criteria. Finally, the selected important factors were used to build multivariable Cox-pH models for OS and also shown in nomograms for clinical usage. Results. The median OS occurred was 25.78 months with 25 (19.53\%) deaths. The elastic-net models integrating clinical and DVH factors had the best prediction performances (C-index 0.76 in the train set and C-index 0.74 in the test set). Three important factors were selected, including baseline hemoglobin level as the protective factor, primary tumor volume (GTV\_P) volume, and body V5 as the risk factors. The final multivariable Cox-pH models were constructed using these important factors and had prediction performance (C-index: 0.78, 95\%CI: 0.73-0.81). Conclusions. This is the first attempt to establish elastic-net models to study the contributions of DVH parameters for predicting OS in patients with cervical cancer. These results can facilitate individualized tailoring of radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients.},

A total of 385 valid questionnaires are collected through quantitative research, and the relationships among the five variables in the model are reanalyzed and revalidated. Results show that the "legal use" variable in the original extended model is not a direct key variable for consumers to accept AI robot lawyers, but it has a direct effect on "perceived ease of use" and "perceived usefulness" variables. AI robots still need to respond actively to attain legitimacy. AI robot lawyers with national legal certification and good user interface design provide humans a sense of trust. AI robot lawyers based on the development of extended intelligence theory can form a closely coordinated working model with humans. In addition, consumers indicate that the normalized use of AI robots could be a trend in the legal industry in the future, and the types of legal profession that robots can replace will not be affected by gender differences. Practitioners using AI robot lawyers need to establish a complete liability risk control system. This study further optimizes the integrity of RLTAM and provides a reference for developers in designing AI robots in the future.},

Cell-of-origin (COO) classification of DLBCL is required in routine practice by the World Health Organization classification for biological and therapeutic insights. Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training setwas robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30\% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL.},

The use of IoT technology in modern healthcare environments is convenient for doctors and patients as it can be used in real-time monitoring of patients, proper administration of patient information, and healthcare management. However, the usage of IoT in the healthcare domain will become a nightmare if patient information is not securely maintained while transferring over an insecure network or storing at the administrator end. In this manuscript, the authors have developed a secure IoT healthcare monitoring system using the Blockchain-based XOR Elliptic Curve Cryptography (BC-XORECC) technique to avoid various vulnerable attacks. Initially, the work has established an authentication process for patient details by generating tokens, keys, and tags using Length Ceaser Cipher-based Pearson Hashing Algorithm (LCC-PHA), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Fishers Yates Shuffled Based Adelson-Velskii and Landis (FYS-AVL) tree. The authentications prevent unauthorized users from accessing or misuse the data. After that, a secure data transfer is performed using BC-XORECC, which acts faster by maintaining high data privacy and blocking the path for the attackers. Finally, the Linear Spline Kernel-Based Recurrent Neural Network (LSK-RNN) classification monitors the patient's health status. The whole developed framework brings out a secure data transfer without data loss or data breaches and remains efficient for health care monitoring via IoT. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves a faster encryption and decryption time, classifies the patient's health status with an accuracy of 89\%, and remains robust compared with the existing state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract = {Screening and timely diagnosis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are currently an important challenge in studies of children’s ethology for increasing community mental health. Nevertheless, most studies on ADHD employed self-report questionnaires in which the reliability is questionable. A few of the studies for diagnosing the ADHD, which used the EEG signals, was not able to enhance the accuracy due to the use of stand-alone classifiers. Therefore, in this paper, we provided a novel analysis framework by combining a set of fuzzy inference system (FIS), called the mixture of expert fuzzy models (MEFM), which have high potential for diagnosing the ADHD children. Within this framework, we developed the MEFM utilizing features extracted from the continuous wavelet transform scalograms of EEG signals obtained from five different channels (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3 and C4). Then, we tuned the internal parameters of the MEFM employing the genetic algorithm. We, also, evaluated the MEFM classifier applying the tenfold cross-validation method and compared this classifier with stand-alone FIS and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results of MEFM classifier due to collective decision-making of the gating network exhibited a significant improvement (99.01\% accuracy) compare to stand-alone classifiers (98.07, 97.81\% and 88.25 for RBF-SVM, stand-alone fuzzy inference system (SFIS), linear-SVM). These results also illustrate that the MEFM classifier (due to distributed structure in comparison with the SFIS classifier) extremely reduced the number of fuzzy rules. Therefore, this new fuzzy combination (among the classifiers developed by several EEG channel) not only is a novelty in the fuzzy theory, but also considers being a better alternative for identifying and screening children with ADHD.},

Recently, neuroimaging-based classifiers for ASD and typically developed (TD) individuals were developed to identify the abnormality of functional connections (FCs). Due to over-fitting and interferential effects of varying measurement conditions and demographic distributions, no classifiers have been strictly validated for independent cohorts. Here we overcome these difficulties by developing a novel machine-learning algorithm that identifies a small number of FCs that separates ASD versus TD. The classifier achieves high accuracy for a Japanese discovery cohort and demonstrates a remarkable degree of generalization for two independent validation cohorts in the USA and Japan. The developed ASD classifier does not distinguish individuals with major depressive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder from their controls but moderately distinguishes patients with schizophrenia from their controls. The results leave open the viable possibility of exploring neuroimaging-based dimensions quantifying the multiple-disorder spectrum.},

The current gold standard for NASH diagnosis and staging is based on histological evaluation, which is largely semi-quantitative and subjective. To address the need for an automated and objective approach to NASH detection, we combined Raman micro-spectroscopy and machine learning techniques to develop a classification model based on a well-established NASH mouse model, using spectrum pre-processing, biochemical component analysis (BCA) and logistic regression. By employing a selected pool of biochemical components, we identified biochemical changes specific to NASH and show that classification model is capable of accurately detecting NASH (AUC=0.85-0.87) in mice. The unique biochemical fingerprint generated in this study may serve as a useful criterion to be leveraged for further validation in clinical samples. [GRAPHICS] .},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a hot topic in machine learning and data processing. Recently, a constrained version, non-smooth NMF (NsNMF), shows a great potential in learning meaningful sparse representation of the observed data. However, it suffers from a slow linear convergence rate, discouraging its applications to large-scale data representation. In this paper, a fast NsNMF (FNsNMF) algorithm is proposed to speed up NsNMF. In the proposed method, it first shows that the cost function of the derived sub-problem is convex and the corresponding gradient is Lipschitz continuous. Then, the optimization to this function is replaced by solving a proximal function, which is designed based on the Lipschitz constant and can be solved through utilizing a constructed fast convergent sequence. Due to the usage of the proximal function and its efficient optimization, our method can achieve a nonlinear convergence rate, much faster than NsNMF. Simulations in both computer generated data and the real-world data show the advantages of our algorithm over the compared methods.},

However, the status of kidney health care needs to be strengthened globally and research evidence in nephrology is relatively limited. The unmet needs in nephrology leave ample space for imagination regarding leveraging big data and artificial intelligence (AI). Big data has potential to drive medical innovation, reduce medical costs and improve health care quality. Compared with other specialties such as cardiology, the scopes of utilizing big data in nephrology need to be enhanced. We reviewed the studies on the application of big data in nephrology, such as disease surveillance, risk prediction and clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and proposed several potential directions of utilizing big data and AI. The efforts including building a CKD surveillance system and collaborative network, implementing a real-world cohort in a cost-effective manner, strengthening the application and transformation of AI and CDSS, and stimulating the activeness of medical imaging in nephrology, could be considered. In the era of big data, a nephrologist would be stronger and smarter if he or she could get intelligent assistance from knowledge or big data-driven CDSS.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMFU) with kinematic recording, this study examined the brain activation and functional connectivity associated with writing to dictation of Chinese characters, contrasted with drawing circles, in 33 healthy adults. It was found that writing Chinese characters recruited activation in the bilateral precentral gyrus, superior/medial frontal gyrus, fusiform gyms, cerebellum and the left precuneus that were associated with the central and peripheral processes of writing. Functional connectivity related to Chinese writing was observed between the left precuneus and both the left pre/postcentral gyrus and the bilateral cerebellum that likely supports motor processing, whereas functional connectivity observed between the right fusiform gyrus and both the bilateral inferior/middle occipital gyms and the right middle frontal gyrus likely supports orthographic processing. Moreover, the functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyms and left superior frontal gyrus reflected the interaction between linguistic and motor processes, supporting the interactive hypothesis concerning the relationship between central and peripheral processes of writing. These findings illustrate the neural mechanisms of Chinese writing, extending our knowledge of the cognitive processing required for this form of human communication.},

Compared to females, males showed increased activation in the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (Exner's area), a region thought to support the conversion between orthographic and graphomotor codes. Functional connectivity between Exner's area and the right cerebellum was greater in males than in females. Furthermore, sex differences in brain activity related to handwriting were independent of language material. This study identifies a novel neural signature of sex differences in a hallmark of human behavior, and highlights the importance of considering sex as a factor in scientific research and clinical applications involving handwriting.},

  abstract = {Light-emitting Diode (LED) lamps have been widely used due to versatility and energy efficiency. However, LEDs are nonlinear loads, the massive usage will inject harmonics into the lighting system, which has influenced the power quality. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is an important parameter to evaluate the power quality, but the prediction of THD for LEDs is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by designing harmonic characteristics detection experiment and using artificial intelligence algorithm. Firstly, LED lamps with different driving circuits were tested, the relevant data of each harmonic were sampled and analyzed. Then, a THD prediction method based on an improved AdaBoost algorithm is proposed. In this method, a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model is established, and its parameters are optimized by Mind Evolution Algorithm (MEA) to improve the search ability of GRNN. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is utilized to integrate multiple MEA-GRNN individuals to form a strong predictor, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To avoid the integration failure caused by improper selection of threshold value, a sigmoid adaptive factor is added to improve the accuracy of AdaBoost algorithm. Finally, the Ada-MEA-GRNN model is trained and simulated with the LED harmonic data collected by the experiment. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is better than BP and GRNN, which can reach 95.48\%. Meanwhile, even if the input dimension is reduced, the error is still small.},

However, the separator plate can restrict the natural movement of the patient's upper lip and generate unpleasant pressure on the patient's philtrum. The present study was intended to measure nasalance scores without touching the philtrum for better comfort during speech assessment and therapy. Methods: Nasalance scores of 10 males and 10 females having no speech disorders were measured under 4 levels (0, 5, 10, and 15 mm) of the gap between the plate and the philtrum (denoted as plate-to-philtrum gap) using Nasometer II 6450 for nasal (Nasal Sentences) and oral (Zoo Passage) stimuli. Regression formulas were established to examine the relationships between nasalance score and plate-to-philtrum gap for the stimuli. To provide nasalance scores equivalent to those measured for the contact condition, compensation factors for the 5 mm plate-to-philtrum gap measurement condition were identified for the stimuli. Results: The nasalance scores were significantly different between the 4 different plate-to-philtrum gaps for the stimuli. Compensation factors for the Nasal Sentences and the Zoo Passage were identified as 1.17 and 0.71, respectively. Conclusions: The 5 mm plate-to-philtrum gap condition after multiplying the compensation factors can provide equivalent nasalance scores to the conventional contact measurement condition which may provide better comfort in speech assessment and therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public’s acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people’s intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care–related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model’s path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R2=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; PP=.03), and resistance bias (beta=–.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=–.095; P=.0497) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. Conclusions: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products.},

  abstract = {Background Information retrieval (IR) help clinicians answer questions posed to large collections of electronic medical records (EMRs), such as how best to identify a patient's cancer stage. One of the more promising approaches to IR for EMRs is to expand a keyword query with similar terms (e.g., augmenting cancer with mets). However, there is a large range of clinical chart review tasks, such that fixed sets of similar terms is insufficient. Current language models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings, do not capture the full non-textual context of a task. In this study, we present new methods that provide similar terms dynamically by adjusting with the context of the chart review task. Methods We introduce a vector space for medical-context in which each word is represented by a vector that captures the word's usage in different medical contexts (e.g., how frequently cancer is used when ordering a prescription versus describing family history) beyond the context learned from the surrounding text. These vectors are transformed into a vector space for customizing the set of similar terms selected for different chart review tasks. We evaluate the vector space model with multiple chart review tasks, in which supervised machine learning models learn to predict the preferred terms of clinically knowledgeable reviewers. To quantify the usefulness of the predicted similar terms to a baseline of standard word2vec embeddings, we measure (1) the prediction performance of the medical-context vector space model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and (2) the labeling effort required to train the models. Results The vector space outperformed the baseline word2vec embeddings in all three chart review tasks with an average AUROC of 0.80 versus 0.66, respectively. Additionally, the medical-context vector space significantly reduced the number of labels required to learn and predict the preferred similar terms of reviewers. Specifically, the labeling effort was reduced to 10\% of the entire dataset in all three tasks. Conclusions The set of preferred similar terms that are relevant to a chart review task can be learned by leveraging the medical context of the task.},

Adopting the TAM model, the study surveyed tourists in the form of a questionnaire and obtained its data from 410 participants. The research investigated tourists' attitudes towards sharing tourism products and the impact of sharing products in tourism services. In the SEM model test and analysis, we found that: (1) sharing tourism products is acceptable to tourists; (2) sharing tourism products brings tourists good travel experiences and improves the quality of tourism services in scenic spots; and (3) tourists can have their special needs and concerns met by sharing tourism products. These prove that tourist sharing products are a scientific and effective way for the tourism industry to improve the travel experience of tourists and to optimize the tourism service industry, and that the sharing concept is in agreeance with the climate of current economic development and the diversified needs of consumers. This research focuses on the promotion of the sharing concept in seaside tourism services. In future research, we can also try to improve the user experience, assist service management, and build a healthy economic ecological model with the application of the sharing concept in different service models and business venues.},

The systems fulfilling this architecture will be able to store electronic health records of the patients using OWL ontologies, share patient records among different hospitals and provide physicians expertise to assist them in making decisions. The system is intelligent because it is rule-based, makes use of rule-based reasoning and has the ability to learn and evolve itself. The learning capability is provided by extracting rules from previously given decisions by the physicians and then adding the extracted rules to the system. The proposed system is novel and original in all of these aspects. As a case study, a system is implemented conforming to SAMS architecture for use by dentists in the dental domain. The use of the developed system is described with a scenario. For evaluation, the developed dental information system will be used and tried by a group of dentists. The development of this system proves the applicability of SAMS architecture. By getting decision support from a system derived from this architecture, the cognitive gap between experienced and inexperienced physicians can be compensated. Thus, patient satisfaction can be achieved, inexperienced physicians are supported in decision making and the personnel can improve their knowledge. A physician can diagnose a case, which he/she has never diagnosed before, using this system. With the help of this system, it will be possible to store general domain knowledge in this system and the personnel's need to medical guideline documents will be reduced.},

  abstract = {Background: Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), caused by the infection of high-risk human papillomavirus, is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide. Methods: RNA expression data, including those from the Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus, and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases, were used to identify the expression of RNAs in normal and tumor tissue. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the immune-related long non-coding RNAs (IRLs) and hypoxia-related genes (IRHs) that can influence the activity of the immune system. Prognosis models of immune-related RNAs (IRRs) were used to construct a coexpression network of the immune system. We identified the role of IRRs in immunotherapy by correlation analysis with immune checkpoint genes (ICGs). We then validated the expression data by integrating two single-cell sequencing data sets of CSCC to identify the key immune features. Results: In total, six immune-related gene (IRG), four IRL, and five IRH signatures that can significantly influence the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) were selected using machine learning methods. The expression level of ICGs was significantly upregulated in GZMB(+)CD8(+) T-cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor tissues. TGFBI(+) TAMs are a kind of blood-derived monocyte-derived M0-like TAM linked to hypoxia and a poor prognosis. IFI30(+) M1-like TAMs participate in the process of immune-regulation and showed a role in the promotion of CD8(+) T-cells and Type 1 T helper (Th1)/Th2 cells in the coexpression network, together with several IRLs, IRGs, and ICGs. Conclusions: CD16(+) monocyte-derived IFI30(+) TAMs participated in our coexpression network to regulate the TIME, showing the potential to be a novel immunotherapy target. The enrichment of M0-like TAMs was associated with a worse prognosis in the high-risk score group with IRH signatures. Remarkably, M0-like TAMs in tumor tissues overexpressed TGFB1 and were associated with several well-known tumor-proliferation pathways.},

  abstract = {Background: The acceptance of wearable intelligent medical devices and the factors influencing behavioral intention to use them have been scarcely studied. This study aimed to increase the current understanding of wearable intelligent medical devices and investigate the factors influencing their acceptance. Methods: Integrating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and the theory of perceived risk, and based on the features of wearable intelligent medical devices, we proposed a modified unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to identify factors influencing the acceptance of these devices. Using data collected from 2,192 respondents in China from an online survey, we used structural equation modeling to test the measurement and structural models. Results: The findings suggested that facilitating conditions (path coefficient =0.942, P{$<$}0.001) were critical to the use of wearable intelligent medical devices. Behavioral intention significantly mediated the effects of perceived risk, perceived cost, health expectation, perceived ease of use, and social influence on user behavior (path coefficient =0.210, P{$<$}0.001). Health expectation (path coefficient =0.860, P{$<$}0.001), perceived ease of use (path coefficient =0.289, P{$<$}0.001), and social influence (path coefficient =0.153, P{$<$}0.001) were found to play essential roles in predicting behavioral intention. Perceived cost (path coefficient =0.034, P{$<$}0.05) and perceived risk (path coefficient =-0.031, P{$<$}0.05) had no significant effect on behavioral intention. People with underlying diseases had lower health expectations and perceived costs. Conclusions: The modified unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model in our research is a reliable model to evaluate the user acceptance of wearable intelligent medical devices.

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. Method(s): We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. Result(s): We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation. Conclusion(s): This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.Copyright © Jiamin Yin, Kee Yuan Ngiam, Hock Hai Teo.

  abstract = {Myelin imaging is a form of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that measures myelin content and can potentially allow demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) to be detected earlier. Although focal lesions are the most visible signs of MS pathology on conventional MRI, it has been shown that even tissues that appear normal may exhibit decreased myelin content as revealed by myelin-specific images (i.e., myelin maps). Current methods for analyzing myelin maps typically use global or regional mean myelin measurements to detect abnormalities, but ignore finer spatial patterns that may be characteristic of MS. In this paper, we present a machine learning method to automatically learn, from multimodal MR images, latent spatial features that can potentially improve the detection of MS pathology at early stage. More specifically, 3D image patches are extracted from myelin maps and the corresponding T1-weighted (T1w) MRIs, and are used to learn a latent joint myelin-T1w feature representation via unsupervised deep learning. Using a data set of images from MS patients and healthy controls, a common set of patches are selected via a voxel-wise t-test performed between the two groups. In each MS image, any patches overlapping with focal lesions are excluded, and a feature imputation method is used to fill in the missing values. A feature selection process (LASSO) is then utilized to construct a sparse representation. The resulting normal-appearing features are used to train a random forest classifier. Using the myelin and T1w images of 55 relapse-remitting MS patients and 44 healthy controls in an 11-fold cross-validation experiment, the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 87.9\% (SD = 8.4\%), which is higher and more consistent across folds than those attained by regional mean myelin (73.7\%, SD = 13.7\%) and T1w measurements (66.7\%, SD = 10.6\%), or deep-learned features in either the myelin (83.8\%, SD = 11.0\%) or T1w (70.1\%, SD = 13.6\%) images alone, suggesting that the proposed method has strong potential for identifying image features that are more sensitive and specific to MS pathology in normal-appearing brain tissues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is recognized as a technology that enhances clinical efficacy and safety. However, its full potential has not been realized, mainly due to clinical data standards and noninteroperable platforms., OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce the common data model-based intelligent algorithm network environment (CANE) platform that supports the implementation and deployment of a CDSS., METHODS: CDSS reasoning engines, usually represented as R or Python objects, are deployed into the CANE platform and converted into C\# objects. When a clinician requests CANE-based decision support in the electronic health record (EHR) system, patients' information is transformed into Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format and transmitted to the CANE server inside the hospital firewall. Upon receiving the necessary data, the CANE system's modules perform the following tasks: (1) the preprocessing module converts the FHIRs into the input data required by the specific reasoning engine, (2) the reasoning engine module operates the target algorithms, (3) the integration module communicates with the other institutions' CANE systems to request and transmit a summary report to aid in decision support, and (4) creates a user interface by integrating the summary report and the results calculated by the reasoning engine., RESULTS: We developed a CANE system such that any algorithm implemented in the system can be directly called through the RESTful application programming interface when it is integrated with an EHR system. Eight algorithms were developed and deployed in the CANE system. Using a knowledge-based algorithm, physicians can screen patients who are prone to sepsis and obtain treatment guides for patients with sepsis with the CANE system. Further, using a nonknowledge-based algorithm, the CANE system supports emergency physicians' clinical decisions about optimum resource allocation by predicting a patient's acuity and prognosis during triage., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a common data model-based platform that adheres to medical informatics standards and could aid artificial intelligence model deployment using R or Python.

Less is known about their robustness against real-world variations, and clinicians may incorrectly assume that a model with an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or related performance metric is ready for clinical use. Here, we systematically assessed the performance of dermatologist-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on real-world non-curated images by applying computational "stress tests". Our goal was to create a proxy environment in which to comprehensively test the generalizability of off-the-shelf CNNs developed without training or evaluation protocols specific to individual clinics. We found inconsistent predictions on images captured repeatedly in the same setting or subjected to simple transformations (e.g., rotation). Such transformations resulted in false positive or negative predictions for 6.5-22\% of skin lesions across test datasets. Our findings indicate that models meeting conventionally reported metrics need further validation with computational stress tests to assess clinic readiness.},

  abstract = {BackgroundFor cancer of unknown primary (CUP), non-selective empiric chemotherapy is usually used. However, patients suffering from CUP are generally assumed to have a dismal prognosis with median overall survival of less than 1 year. Therefore, clinicians eagerly await the establishment of effective strategies for diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, the remarkable advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have enabled the wide usage of DNA/RNA sequencing to comprehensively analyze the molecular information of individual tumors and identify potential targets for patients' diagnosis and treatment. Here, we describe a patient of CUP who was successfully diagnosed and treated with targeted therapy directed by comprehensive molecular profiling. Case PresentationA 61-year-old Asian woman with a painless, slow-growing mass lesion in the mesosternum underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and was found to have malignant metastatic tumors in the mesosternum. Conventional pathological examination of metastatic lesions could not conclude the primary origin of the tumors. The patient was diagnosed with CUP at first. Then, comprehensive molecular profiling was employed to identify the tumor origin and genetic alterations. A gene expression-based tissue origin assay was performed using a tissue biopsy sample. The test result suggested that the lesion tumors might be breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, liquid biopsy-based circulating tumor DNA profiling detected an ERBB2 copy number amplification. Subsequent surgery and additional postoperative pathology analysis confirmed that the primary tumor site was indeed located in the right outer upper quadrant of the breast. After local surgical resection, the patient received 8 cycles of Docetaxel + Carboplatin + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab (TCbHP) chemotherapy with subsequent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted maintenance therapy. Currently, the patient is on regular follow-up and has achieved disease control for up to 6 months. ConclusionOur findings suggest that molecular identification of the tumor origin and the detection of actionable molecular alterations may offer promise for improved diagnostic accuracy and important therapeutic implications for patients with the CUP syndrome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information captured in the free text image reports., METHODS: In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings including 'gold-standard' setting-where gold-standard concepts were used-and end-to-end setting., RESULTS: For concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The end-to-end system, BERT\_general\_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa architecture, RoBERTa\_general\_e2e, also achieved the same performance as BERT\_general\_e2e in strict scores., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. Our results show that it's necessary to pretrain transformer models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using general English text perform better. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

Therefore, to benefit autism patients by enhancing their access to treatments such as early intervention, we aim to develop a robust machine learning-based system for autism detection by using Natural Language Processing techniques based on information extracted from medical forms of potential ASD patients. Our detecting framework involves converting semi-structured and unstructured medical forms into digital format, preprocessing, learning document representation, and finally, classification. Testing results are evaluated against the ground truth set by expert clinicians and the proposed system achieve a 83.4\% accuracy and 91.1\% recall, which is very promising.

On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.},

This paper introduces the new framework for HIS evaluation that incorporates comprehensive dimensions and measures of HIS and provides a technological, human and organizational fit. Methods Literature review on HIS and IS evaluation studies and pilot testing of developed framework. The framework was used to evaluate a Fundus Imaging System (FIS) of a primary care organization in the UK. The case study was conducted through observation, interview and document analysis. Results The main findings show that having the right user attitude and skills base together with good leadership, IT-friendly environment and good communication can have positive influence on the system adoption. Conclusions Comprehensive, specific evaluation factors, dimensions and measures in the new framework (HOT-fit) are applicable in HIS evaluation. The use of such a framework is argued to be useful not only for comprehensive evaluation of the particular FIS system under investigation, but potentially also for any Health Information System in general.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards AI and to provide information about their opinions to use of AI in dentistry. Methods A 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 ± 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69\% response rate. Of these, about 48.40\% had basic knowledge about AI technologies and 10.6\% stated that they had no information sources about AI. 85.70\% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by AI but 28.60\% did not agree that AI could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60\% and 79.80\% of agreed on topics about AI to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively. Conclusions Although participants have insufficient knowledge of AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge in this field. Participants shared an optimistic views and thought that AI will have a positive impact on dental future practice. Follow-up surveys and multinational studies should be conducted to further explore these issues.},

  abstract = {Quantitative image analysis has deep roots in the usage of positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical and research settings to address a wide variety of diseases. It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states, in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet, quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging, the limitations of the instrumentation used, and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover, there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metric(s) that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features (radiomics) from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large. In this report, we summarize recent developments and future tendencies in quantitative PET imaging and present example applications in clinical decision support to illustrate its potential in the context of clinical oncology.

  abstract = {Background: Rapid growth of the integration of technology and psychotherapeutic interventions has been noted, but no clear quantification of this growth has been done. Aims: This bibliometric analysis seeks to quantify the growth, trends, and applications of technology in psychotherapeutic interventions over the last 40 years. Methods: Searches were conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) database for all existing technologypsychotherapy-related publications from 1981 to October 2020. Search terms were refined using a systematic screening strategy, based upon Cochrane protocol, generating 52 technology terms. Analyses across 40 years and by decade from 1981 to 2020 were conducted. Results: A total of 13,934 peer-reviewed articles were identified. Yearly publication rate has increased from one in 1981 to 1902 by October 2020. The growth rate of publications across decades consistently tripled in size (762.50\% from the 1980s to 1990s, 539.71\% from the 1990s to 2000s, and 337.24\% from the 2000s to 2010s). The author, country, journal, and institution with the most publications were Andersson, G., USA, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Karolinska Institute, respectively. The most frequent technology search term across all four decades was "internet*." The trends in percentages of peer-reviewed publications within each decade showed: 1) a declining trend for the term "computer," 2) an upward trend for the combined terms, "internet," "online," and "web," 3) and a steady but smaller proportion of publications for other terms ("cell phone," "phone/telephone," "technology," "video," "virtual reality or VR," "apps," "digital," "machine learning," "electronic," "robo," and "telehealth"). Discussion: The rapid growth and trends identified in technology and psychotherapy publications can inform related policies addressing the role of technology in mental health. Moreover, pattern analyses may provide direction for a standard nomenclature to address terminology usage inconsistencies across the field.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Glucose management in the hospital is difficult due to non-static factors such as antihyperglycemic and steroid doses, renal function, infection, surgical status, and diet. Given these complex and dynamic factors, machine learning approaches can be leveraged for prediction of glucose trends in the hospital to mitigate and prevent suboptimal hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic outcomes. Our aim was to review the clinical evidence for the role of machine learning-based models in predicting hospitalized patients' glucose trajectory., RECENT FINDINGS: The published literature on machine learning algorithms has varied in terms of population studied, outcomes of interest, and validation methods. There have been tools developed that utilize data from both continuous glucose monitors and large electronic health records (EHRs). With increasing sample sizes, inclusion of a greater number of predictor variables, and use of more advanced machine learning algorithms, there has been a trend in recent years towards increasing predictive accuracy for glycemic outcomes in the hospital setting. While current models predicting glucose trajectory offer promising results, they have not been tested prospectively in the clinical setting. Accurate machine learning algorithms have been developed and validated for prediction of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital. Further work is needed in implementation/integration of machine learning models into EHR systems, with prospective studies to evaluate effectiveness and safety of such clinical decision support on glycemic and other clinical outcomes.

Providers could benefit from a clinical decision support tool that predicts the trajectory of a patient's BG reading. The purpose of our study was to predict the category of a patient's next BG reading based on electronic medical record (EMR) data. Method(s): EMR data from 184,361 admissions, containing 4,538,418 BG readings from five hospitals in the Johns Hopkins Health System were collected over a 4.5 year period. The outcome was category of next BG reading: hypoglycemic (BG {$<$}=70 mg/dl), controlled (BG 71-180 mg/dl), or hyperglycemic (BG {$>$}180 mg/dl). A Logit Boost machine learning algorithm that included a broad range of clinical predictors was used to predict the outcome and validated internally (within one hospital) and externally (between different hospitals). Result(s): Our machine learning model achieved 86.2\% (95\% CI: 86.1\%-86.2\%) accuracy on internal validation and 80.4\%-83.2\% on external validation. On internal validation, the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for a prediction of controlled, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic were 2.4, 12.3, and 47.4 respectively; the negative likelihood ratio (-LR) for a prediction of controlled, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic were 0.09, 0.38, and 0.99 on internal validation. From a safety standpoint, only 0.23\% of hyperglycemic observations were predicted to be hypoglycemic on internal validation. On external validation, the +LR for prediction of controlled, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic were 2.2-2.8, 6.3-8.5, and 23.1-62.7; the -LR for a prediction of controlled, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic were 0.13-0.16, 0.32-0.42, and 0.98-0.99. Conclusion(s): A machine learning algorithm accurately predicts the category of a patient's next BG reading. Further studies should determine the success of implementing this model into the EMR to decrease the rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients.},

This approach is also gaining momentum in various stem cells research activities, specifically for stem cells characterization and differentiation pattern. The adoption of similar computational approaches to study and assess biosafety and bioefficacy risks of stem cells for clinical application is the next progression. In particular where tumorigenicity has been one of the major concerns in stem cells therapy. There are many factors influencing tumorigenicity in stem cells which may be difficult to capture under conventional laboratory settings. In addition, given the possible multifactorial etiology of tumorigenicity, defining a one-size-fits-all strategy to test such risk in stem cells might not be feasible and may compromise stem cells safety and effectiveness in therapy. Given the increase in biological datasets (which is no longer limited to genomic data) and the advancement of health informatics powered by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, there exists a potential for practical application in biosafety and bioefficacy of stem cells therapy. Here, we identified relevant machine learning approaches and suggested protocols intended for stem cells research focusing on the possibility of its usage for stem cells biosafety and bioefficacy assessment. Ultimately, generating models that may assist healthcare professionals to make a better-informed decision in stem cell therapy.},

However, missing data are common in EHR-derived datasets, which can introduce significant uncertainty, if not invalidating the use of a predictive model. Machine learning (ML)-based imputation methods have shown promise in various domains for the task of estimating values and reducing uncertainty to the point that a predictive model can be employed. We introduce Autopopulus, a novel framework that enables the design and evaluation of various autoencoder architectures for efficient imputation on large datasets. Autopopulus implements existing autoencoder methods as well as a new technique that outputs a range of estimated values (rather than point estimates), and demonstrates a workflow that helps users make an informed decision on an appropriate imputation method. To further illustrate Autopopulus' utility, we use it to identify not only which imputation methods can most accurately impute on a large clinical dataset, but to also identify the imputation methods that enable downstream predictive models to achieve the best performance for prediction of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.},

Recently, pharmacogenetic biomarkers entered in prescribing guidelines, giving clinicians the possibility to use this additional tool to guide prescription and improve therapeutic outcomes. This marked an important step towards precision psychiatry, which aim is to integrate biological and environmental information to personalise treatments. Only genetic variants in cytochrome enzymes are endorsed by prescribing guidelines, but in the future polygenic predictors of treatment outcomes may be translated into the clinic. The integration of genetics with other relevant information (e.g., concomitant diseases and treatments, drug plasma levels) could be managed in a standardised way through ad hoc software. The overcoming of the current obstacles (e.g., staff training, genotyping and informatics facilities) can lead to a broad implementation of precision psychiatry and represent a revolution for psychiatric care.},

Method(s): Experts' rules and statistical/machine learning algorithms for interpreting HIV drug resistance, along with their program implementations, were retrieved from PubMed and other on-line resources to be critically reviewed in terms of technical approach, performance, usability, update, and evolution (i.e. inclusion of novel drugs or expansion to other viral agents). Result(s): Several drug resistance prediction algorithms for the nucleotide/nucleoside/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitors as well as coreceptor antagonists are currently available, routinely used, and have been validated thoroughly in independent studies. Computer tools that combine single-drug genotypic/phenotypic resistance interpretation and optimize combination antiretroviral therapy have been also developed and implemented as web applications. Most of the systems have been updated timely to incorporate new drugs and few have recently been expanded to meet a similar need in the Hepatitis C area. Prototype systems aiming at predicting virological response from both virus and patient indicators have been recently developed but they are not yet being routinely used.

Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of AI projects. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists’ acceptance of AI contouring technology in a Chinese context. Methods: A model of AI-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model’s path effects, significance, and fitness. Results: The overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy (β=.155; P=.01), social influence (β=.365; P\&lt;.001), and facilitating conditions (β=.459; P\&lt;.001). Effort expectancy (β=.055; P=.45), perceived risk (β=−.048; P=.35), and resistance bias (β=−.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention. Conclusions: The physicians’ overall perceptions of an AI-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh UTAUT model applied to AI technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pediatric supratentorial tumors such as embryonal tumors, high-grade gliomas, and ependymomas are difficult to distinguish by histopathology and imaging because of overlapping features. We applied machine learning to uncover MR imaging?based radiomics phenotypes that can differentiate these tumor types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective cohort of 231 patients from 7 participating institutions had 50 embryonal tumors, 127 high-grade gliomas, and 54 ependymomas. For each tumor volume, we extracted 900 Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative?based PyRadiomics features from T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. A reduced feature set was obtained by sparse regression analysis and was used as input for 6 candidate classifier models. Training and test sets were randomly allocated from the total cohort in a 75:25 ratio. RESULTS: The final classifier model for embryonal tumor-versus-high-grade gliomas identified 23 features with an area under the curve of 0.98; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 0.85, 0.91, 0.79, 0.94, and 0.89, respectively. The classifier for embryonal tumor-versus-ependymomas identified 4 features with an area under the curve of 0.82; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 0.93, 0.69, 0.76, 0.90, and 0.81, respectively. The classifier for high-grade gliomas-versus-ependymomas identified 35 features with an area under the curve of 0.96; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 0.82, 0.94, 0.82, 0.94, and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-institutional study, we identified distinct radiomic phenotypes that distinguish pediatric supratentorial tumors, high-grade gliomas, and ependymomas with high accuracy. Incorporation of this technique in diagnostic algorithms can improve diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning.},

  abstract = {The understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders with neurobiological and clinical heterogeneity could benefit from the identification of disease subtypes on the basis of data acquired with established neuroimaging technologies. Here, we report the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of robust and distinct functional-connectivity patterns, prominently within the frontoparietal-control and default-mode networks. We identified the disease subtypes by analysing, via unsupervised and supervised machine learning, the power-envelope-based connectivity of signals reconstructed from high-density resting-state electroencephalography in four datasets from patients with PTSD and MDD, and show that the subtypes are transferable across independent datasets recorded under different conditions. The subtype whose functional connectivity differed most from those of healthy controls was less responsive to psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and failed to respond to an antidepressant medication for MDD. By contrast, both subtypes responded equally well to two different forms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for MDD. Our data-driven approach may constitute a generalizable solution for connectome-based diagnosis., The analysis of functional-connectivity patterns in resting-state electroencephalography data via machine learning led to the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinicoradiologic differentiation between benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) has important management implications. OBJECTIVE To develop and evaluate machine-learning approaches to differentiate benign from malignant PNSTs. METHODS We identified PNSTs treated at 3 institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomics features from gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Training and test sets were selected randomly in a 70:30 ratio. A total of 900 image features were automatically extracted using the PyRadiomics package from Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Clinical data including age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome presence, spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were also incorporated. Features were selected using sparse regression analysis and retained features were further refined by gradient boost modeling to optimize the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of radiomics-based classifiers with and without clinical features and compared performance against human readers. RESULTS A total of 95 malignant and 171 benign PNSTs were included. The final classifier model included 21 imaging and clinical features. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.676, 0.882, and 0.845, respectively, were achieved on the test set. Using imaging and clinical features, human experts collectively achieved sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.786, 0.431, and 0.624, respectively. The AUC of the classifier was statistically better than expert humans (P = .002). Expert humans were not statistically better than the no-information rate, whereas the classifier was (P = .001). CONCLUSION Radiomics-based machine learning using routine MRI sequences and clinical features can aid in evaluation of PNSTs. Further improvement may be achieved by incorporating additional imaging sequences and clinical variables into future models.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Yang and Yin are two main concepts responsible for harmonious balance reflecting health conditions based on Chinese medicine theory. Of note, deficiency of either Yang or Yin is associated with disease susceptibility. In this study, we aim to clarify the molecular feature of Yang and Yin deficiency by reanalyzing a transcriptomic data set retrieved from the GEO database using R-based machine learning analyses, which lays a foundation for medical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of unbalanced Yang or Yin. Methods. Besides conventional methods for target mining, we took the advantage of spatial transcriptomic analysis using R-based machine learning approaches to elucidate molecular profiles of Yin and Yang deficiency by reanalyzing an RNA-Seq data set (GSE87474) in the GEO focusing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The add-on functions in R including GEOquery, DESeq2, WGCNA (target identification with a scale-free topological assumption), Scatterplot3d, Tidyverse, and UpsetR were used. For information in the selected GEO data set, PBMCs representing 20,740 expressed genes were collected from subjects with Yang or Yin deficiency (n = 12 each), based on Chinese medicine-related diagnostic criteria. Results. The symptomatic gene targets for Yang deficiency (KAT2B, NFKB2, CREBBP, GTF2H3) or Yin deficiency (JUNB, JUND, NGLY1, TNF, RAF1, PPP1R15A) were potentially discovered. CREBBP was identified as a shared key contributive gene regulating either the Yang or Yin deficiency group. The intrinsic molecular characteristics of these specific genes could link with clinical observations of Yang/Yin deficiency, in which Yang deficiency is associated with immune dysfunction tendency and energy deregulation, while Yin deficiency mainly contains oxidative stress, dysfunction of the immune system, and abnormal lipid/protein metabolism. Conclusion. Our study provides representative gene targets and modules for supporting clinical traits of Yang or Yin deficiency in Chinese medicine theory, which is beneficial for promoting the modernization of Chinese medicine theory. Besides, R-based machine learning approaches adopted in this study might be further applied for investigating the underlying genetic polymorphisms related to Chinese medicine theory.},

While subtotal tumor resection is known to confer worse prognosis, MRI-based EP risk-profiling is unexplored. We aimed to apply machine learning strategies to link MRI-based biomarkers of high-risk EP and also to distinguish PFA from PFB. Methods We extracted 1800 quantitative features from presurgical T2-weighted (T2-MRI) and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-MRI) imaging of 157 EP patients. We implemented nested cross-validation to identify features for risk score calculations and apply a Cox model for survival analysis. We conducted additional feature selection for PFA versus PFB and examined performance across three candidate classifiers. Results For all EP patients with GTR, we identified four T2-MRI-based features and stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with 5-year overall survival rates of 62\% and 100\%, respectively (P {$<$} .0001). Among presumed PFA patients with GTR, four T1-MRI and five T2-MRI features predicted divergence of high- and low-risk groups, with 5-year overall survival rates of 62.7\% and 96.7\%, respectively (P = .002). T1-MRI-based features showed the best performance distinguishing PFA from PFB with an AUC of 0.86. Conclusions We present machine learning strategies to identify MRI phenotypes that distinguish PFA from PFB, as well as high- and low-risk PFA. We also describe quantitative image predictors of aggressive EP tumors that might assist risk-profiling after surgery. Future studies could examine translating radiomics as an adjunct to EP risk assessment when considering therapy strategies or trial candidacy.},

  abstract = {Background: Radiogenomics of pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) offers an opportunity for MB risk stratification, which may aid therapeutic decision making, family counseling, and selection of patient groups suitable for targeted genetic analysis. Purpose: To develop machine learning strategies that identify the four clinically significant MB molecular subgroups. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, consecutive pediatric patients with newly diagnosed MB at MRI at 12 international pediatric sites between July 1997 and May 2020 were identified. There were 1800 features extracted from T2- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative MRI scans. A two-stage sequential classifier was designed-one that first identifies non-wingless (WNT) and non-sonic hedgehog (SHH) MB and then differentiates therapeutically relevant WNT from SHH. Further, a classifier that distinguishes high-risk group 3 from group 4 MB was developed. An independent, binary subgroup analysis was conducted to uncover radiomics features unique to infantile versus childhood SHH subgroups. The best-performing models from six candidate classifiers were selected, and performance was measured on holdout test sets. CIs were obtained by bootstrapping the test sets for 2000 random samples. Model accuracy score was compared with the no-information rate using the Wald test. Results: The study cohort comprised 263 patients (mean age +/- SD at diagnosis, 87 months +/- 60; 166 boys). A two-stage classifier outperformed a single-stage multiclass classifier. The combined, sequential classifier achieved a microaveraged F1 score of 88\% and a binary F1 score of 95\% specifically for WNT. A group 3 versus group 4 classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 98\%. Of the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative features, texture and first-order intensity features were most contributory across the molecular subgroups. Conclusion: An MRI-based machine learning decision path allowed identification of the four clinically relevant molecular pediatric medulloblastoma subgroups.(C) RSNA, 2022},

  abstract = {Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequent complications of critical illness. We aimed to explore the predictors of renal function recovery and the short-term reversibility after AKI by comparing logistic regression with four machine learning models. Methods We reviewed patients who were diagnosed with AKI in the MIMIC-IV database between 2008 and 2019. Recovery from AKI within 72 h of the initiating event was typically recognized as the short-term reversal of AKI. Conventional logistic regression and four different machine algorithms (XGBoost algorithm model, Bayesian networks [BNs], random forest [RF] model, and support vector machine [SVM] model) were used to develop and validate prediction models. The performance measures were compared through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC), calibration curves, and 10-fold cross-validation. Results A total of 12,321 critically ill adult AKI patients were included in our analysis cohort. The renal function recovery rate after AKI was 67.9\%. The maximum and minimum serum creatinine (SCr) within 24 h of AKI diagnosis, the minimum SCr within 24 and 12 h, and antibiotics usage duration were independently associated with renal function recovery after AKI. Among the 8364 recovered patients, the maximum SCr within 24 h of AKI diagnosis, the minimum Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, the maximum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within 24 h, vasopressin and vancomycin usage, and the maximum lactate within 24 h were the top six predictors for short-term reversibility of AKI. The RF model presented the best performance for predicting both renal functional recovery (AU-ROC [0.8295 +/- 0.01]) and early recovery (AU-ROC [0.7683 +/- 0.03]) compared with the conventional logistic regression model. Conclusions The maximum SCr within 24 h of AKI diagnosis was a common independent predictor of renal function recovery and the short-term reversibility of AKI. The RF machine learning algorithms showed a superior ability to predict the prognosis of AKI patients in the ICU compared with the traditional regression models. These models may prove to be clinically helpful and can assist clinicians in providing timely interventions, potentially leading to improved prognoses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a scientific discipline, which develops the related theories from the long-term clinical practices. The large-scale clinical data are the core empirical knowledge source for TCM research. This paper introduces a clinical data warehouse (CDW) system, which incorporates the structured electronic medical record (SEMR) data for medical knowledge discovery and TCM clinical decision support (CDS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed the clinical reference information model (RIM) and physical data model to manage the various information entities and their relationships in TCM clinical data. An extraction-transformation-loading (ETL) tool is implemented to integrate and normalize the clinical data from different operational data sources. The CDW includes online analytical processing (OLAP) and complex network analysis (CNA) components to explore the various clinical relationships. Furthermore, the data mining and CNA methods are used to discover the valuable clinical knowledge from the data., RESULTS: The CDW has integrated 20,000 TCM inpatient data and 20,000 outpatient data, which contains manifestations (e.g. symptoms, physical examinations and laboratory test results), diagnoses and prescriptions as the main information components. We propose a practical solution to accomplish the large-scale clinical data integration and preprocessing tasks. Meanwhile, we have developed over 400 OLAP reports to enable the multidimensional analysis of clinical data and the case-based CDS. We have successfully conducted several interesting data mining applications. Particularly, we use various classification methods, namely support vector machine, decision tree and Bayesian network, to discover the knowledge of syndrome differentiation. Furthermore, we have applied association rule and CNA to extract the useful acupuncture point and herb combination patterns from the clinical prescriptions., CONCLUSION: A CDW system consisting of TCM clinical RIM, ETL, OLAP and data mining as the core components has been developed to facilitate the tasks of TCM knowledge discovery and CDS. We have conducted several OLAP and data mining tasks to explore the empirical knowledge from the TCM clinical data. The CDW platform would be a promising infrastructure to make full use of the TCM clinical data for scientific hypothesis generation, and promote the development of TCM from individualized empirical knowledge to large-scale evidence-based medicine.

To achieve this, multidimensional detection of SARS-CoV-2 related parameters including virus loads, immune response, and inflammation factors is crucial. Herein, by using metal-tagged antibodies as reporting probes, we developed a multiplex metal-detection based assay (MMDA) method as a general multiplex assay strategy for biofluids. This strategy provides extremely high multiplexing capability (theoretically over 100) compared with other reported biofluid assay methods. As a proof-of-concept, MMDA was used for serologic profiling of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The MMDA exhibits significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By integrating the high dimensional data exploration/visualization tool (tSNE) and machine learning algorithms with in-depth analysis of multiplex data, we classified COVID-19 patients into different subgroups based on their distinct antibody landscape. We unbiasedly identified anti-SARS-CoV-2-nucleocapsid IgG and IgA as the most potently induced types of antibodies for COVID-19 diagnosis, and anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike IgA as a biomarker for disease severity stratification. MMDA represents a more accurate method for the diagnosis and disease severity stratification of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for biomarker discovery of other diseases.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the problem of long execution time of traditional legal text classification, this paper designs a legal text classification method based on machine learning. Based on the combination of support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes classifier in machine learning, the feature value of legal text is filtered, the legal text classification matrix is established, and the legal text classification results are accessed directly through embedded system to realize the legal text classification. The experimental results show that the implementation time of the design method is more than twice as fast as that of the control group, which can solve the problem of long implementation time of the traditional method. AI and machine learning have the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare. However, creating decision support systems based on machine learning requires more than just a technological undertaking. As a result, bioethical standards must be considered. As AI and machine learning progress, bioethical frameworks must be adapted to solve the difficulties that these growing systems may bring, and the creation of these automated systems also has to be tailored to embrace bioethical concepts.Copyright © 2021 ThinkBiotech LLC.

  abstract = {Background: Approximately 1 in 5 patients feel unsatisfied after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Prognostic tools may aid in the patient selection process and reduce the proportion of patients who experience unsatisfactory surgery. This study uses the prognostic tool SMART Choice (Patient Prognostic Tool for Total Knee Arthroplasty) to predict patient improvement after TKA. The tool aims to be used by the patient without clinician input and does not require clinical data such as X-ray findings or blood results. The objective of this study is to evaluate the SMART Choice tool on patient decision making, particularly willingness for surgery. We hypothesise that the use of the SMART Choice tool will influence willingness to undergo surgery, especially when used earlier in the patient TKA journey. Method(s): This is a multicentred, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Participants will be recruited from the St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne (SVHM) Orthopaedic Clinic, and the client base of HCF, Australia (private health insurance company). Patients over 45 years of age who have been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and considering TKA are eligible for participation. Participants will be randomised to either use the SMART Choice tool or treatment as usual. The SMART Choice tool provides users with a prediction for improvement or deterioration / no change after surgery based on utility score change calculated from the Veterans-RAND 12 (VR-12) survey. The primary outcome of the study is patient willingness for TKA surgery. The secondary outcomes include evaluating the optimal timing for tool use and using decision quality questionnaires to understand the patient experience when using the tool. Participants will be followed up for 6 months from the time of recruitment. Discussion(s): The SMART Choice tool has the potential to improve patient decision making for TKA. Although many prognostic tools have been developed for other areas of surgery, most are confined within academic bodies of work. This study will be one of the first to evaluate the impact of a prognostic tool on patient decision making using a prospective clinical trial, an important step in transitioning the tool for use in clinical practice.

This model consists of two parts, a classifier and an intuitive representation of discriminative pattern of brain function between patients and normal controls. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of brain function at resting-state, is used here as a feature of classification. Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) is performed on the features of training samples and a linear classifier is generated. Our initial experimental results show a successful classification rate of 85\%, using leave-one-out cross validation. The classifier is also compared with linear support vector machine (SVM) and Batch Perceptron. Our classifier outperforms the alternatives significantly. Fisher brain, the optimal projective-direction vector in FDA, is used to represent the discriminative pattern. Some abnormal brain regions identified by Fisher brain, like prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are well consistent with that reported in neuroimaging studies on ADHD. Moreover, some less reported but highly discriminative regions are also identified. We conclude that the discriminative model has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD.},

  abstract = {Background: Data coordination across multiple health care facilities has become increasingly important for many emerging health care applications. Distrust has been recognized as a key barrier to the success of such applications. Leveraging blockchain technology could provide potential solutions tobuild trust between data providers and receivers by taking advantage of blockchain properties such as security, immutability, anonymity, decentralization, and smart contracts. Many health technologies have empirically proven that blockchain designs fit well with the needs of health care applications with certain degrees of success. However, there is a lack of robust architecture to provide a practical framework for developers to implement applications and test the performance of stability, efficiency, and scalability using standard blockchain designs. A generalized blockchain model is needed for the health care community to adopt blockchain technology and develop applications in a timely fashion. Objective: This study aimed at building a generalized blockchain architecture that provides data coordination functions, including data requests, permission granting, data exchange, and usage tracking, for a wide spectrum of health care application developments. Methods: An augmented, 3-layered blockchain architecture was built on a private blockchain network. The 3 layers, from bottom to top, are as follows: (1) incorporation of fundamental blockchain settings and smart contract design for data collection; (2) interactions between the blockchain and health care application development environment using Nodejs and web3 js; and (3) a flexible development platform that supports web technologies such as HTML, https, and various programing languages. Two example applications, health information exchange (HIE) and clinical trial recruitment, were developed in our design to demonstrate the feasibility of the layered architecture. Case studies were conducted to test the performance in terms of stability, efficiency, and scalability of the blockchain system. Results: A total of 331,142 simulated HIE requests from accounts of 40,000 patients were successfully validated through this layered blockchain architecture with an average exchange time of 11.271 (SD 2.208) seconds. We also simulated a clinical trial recruitment scenario with the same set of patients and various recruitment criteria to match potential subjects using the same architecture. Potential subjects successfully received the clinical trial recruitment information and granted permission to the trial sponsors to access their health records with an average time of 3.07 seconds. Conclusions: This study proposes a generalized layered blockchain architecture that offers health technology community blockchain features for application development without requiring developers to have extensive experience with blockchain technology. The case studies tested the performance of our design and empirically proved the feasibility of the architecture in 2 relevant health application domains.},

The system is composed of distributed Web services, which implement machine-learning solutions dedicated to constructing the decision models directly from the datasets impaired by the high percentage of missing values of the attributes and imbalanced class distribution. The issue of the imbalanced data is solved by the application of a cost-sensitive support vector machine and the problem of missing values of attributes is handled by proposing the novel ensemble-based approach that splits the incomplete data space into complete subspaces that are further used to construct base learners. We evaluate the quality of the SOSDS components using three ontological datasets.},

  abstract = {Language production provides important markers of neurological health. One feature of impairments of language and cognition, such as those that occur in stroke aphasia or Alzheimer's disease, is an overuse of high frequency, "familiar" expressions. We used computerized analysis to profile narrative speech samples from speakers with variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Analysis was performed on language samples from 29 speakers with semantic variant PPA (svPPA), 25 speakers with logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), 34 speakers with non-fluent variant PPA (nfvPPA), 14 speakers with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and 20 older normal controls (NCs). We used frequency and collocation strength measures to determine use of familiar words and word combinations. We also computed word counts, content word ratio and a combination ratio, a measure of the degree to which the individual produces connected language. All dementia subtypes differed significantly from NCs. The most discriminating variables were word count, combination ratio, and content word ratio, each of which distinguished at least one dementia group from NCs. All participants with PPA, but not participants with bvFTD, produced significantly more frequent forms at the level of content words, word combinations, or both. Each dementia group differed from the others on at least one variable, and language production variables correlated with established behavioral measures of disease progression. A machine learning classifier, using narrative speech variables, achieved 90\% accuracy when classifying samples as NC or dementia, and 59.4\% accuracy when matching samples to their diagnostic group. Automated quantification of spontaneous speech in both language-led and non-language led dementias, is feasible. It allows extraction of syndromic profiles that complement those derived from standardized tests, warranting further evaluation as candidate biomarkers. Inclusion of frequency-based language variables benefits profiling and classification. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.},
