The algorithm was introduced in three phases: (a)                             as a “pop-up” widget on ancillary monitors,                                 (b) as a marked examination in reading worklists,                             and (c) as a marked examination for reprioritization                             based on the presence of the flag. A statistical approach, which was                             based on a queuing theory, was implemented to assess the impact of each                             intervention on queue-adjusted wait and turnaround time compared with                             historical controls.ResultsNotification with a widget or flagging the examination had no effect on                             queue-adjusted image wait (P {\textgreater} .99) or turnaround                             time (P = .6). However, a reduction in                             queue-adjusted wait time was observed between negative (15.45 minutes;                             95\% CI: 15.07, 15.38) and positive (12.02 minutes; 95\% CI: 11.06, 12.97;                                 P {\textless} .0001) artificial                             intelligence–detected ICH examinations with reprioritization.

	abstract = {Purpose: Recently developed machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated strong performance in the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, their generalizability is often limited by geographic bias of studies. The aim of this study was to validate a commercially available deep learning-based tool in the detection of both ICH and LVO across multiple hospital sites and vendors throughout the U.S.Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective and multicenter study using anonymized data from two institutions. Eight hundred fourteen non-contrast CT cases and 378 CT angiography cases were analyzed to evaluate ICH and LVO, respectively. The tool's ability to detect and quantify ICH, LVO, and their various subtypes was assessed among multiple CT vendors and hospitals across the United States. Ground truth was based off imaging interpretations from two board-certified neuroradiologists.Results: There were 255 positive and 559 negative ICH cases. Accuracy was 95.6\%, sensitivity was 91.4\%, and specificity was 97.5\% for the ICH tool. ICH was further stratified into the following subtypes: intraparenchymal, intraventricular, epidural/subdural, and subarachnoid with true positive rates of 92.9, 100, 94.3, and 89.9\%, respectively. ICH true positive rates by volume [small ({\textless}5 mL), medium (5–25 mL), and large ({\textgreater}25 mL)] were 71.8, 100, and 100\%, respectively. There were 156 positive and 222 negative LVO cases. The LVO tool demonstrated an accuracy of 98.1\%, sensitivity of 98.1\%, and specificity of 98.2\%. A subset of 55 randomly selected cases were also assessed for LVO detection at various sites, including the distal internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery M1 segment, proximal middle cerebral artery M2 segment, and distal middle cerebral artery M2 segment with an accuracy of 97.0\%, sensitivity of 94.3\%, and specificity of 97.4\%.Conclusion: Deep learning tools can be effective in the detection of both ICH and LVO across a wide variety of hospital systems. While some limitations were identified, specifically in the detection of small ICH and distal M2 occlusion, this study highlights a deep learning tool that can assist radiologists in the detection of emergent findings in a variety of practice settings.},

	abstract = {Owing to improvements in image recognition via deep learning, machine-learning algorithms could eventually be applied to automated medical diagnoses that can guide clinical decision-making. However, these algorithms remain a ‘black box’ in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98\% and specificity of 95\%) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92\% and specificity of 95\%). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. In this review, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithms versus health care professionals (HCPs) in classifying diseases from medical imaging.      Methods: We searched (Pre-)Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and arXiv from 01 January 2012 until 31 May 2018. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of DL models and HCPs, for any pre-specified condition based on medical imaging material, were included. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables at the reported thresholds to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample validation were included in a meta-analysis.      Results: 24 studies, from a starting number of 19889, compared DL models with HCPs. 22 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy. The mean sensitivity for DL models was 78\% (range 13 - 100\%), and mean specificity was 86\% (range 51 - 100\%). An out-of-sample external validation was performed by 5 studies and were therefore included in the meta-analysis. We found a pooled sensitivity of 86\% (95\% CI: 84 - 88\%) for DL models and 93\% (95\% CI: 87 - 97\%) for HCPs, and a pooled specificity of 88\% (95\% CI: 84 - 92\%) for DL models and 87\% (95\% CI: 84 - 89\%) for HCPs.     Conclusion: Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be similar to health care professionals. A major finding was the poor reporting and potential biases arising from study design that limited reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards which address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.Funding Statement: The authors state: "None"Declaration of Interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form online (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.Ethics Approval Statement: The authors state: "Not required."

Computed tomography angiography is recommended as the standard diagnosis tool; yet, interpretation can be time-consuming and challenging. We present a specific deep-learning-based model trained on 1,177 digital subtraction angiography verified bone-removal computed tomography angiography cases. The model has good tolerance to image quality and is tested with different manufacturers. Simulated real-world studies are conducted in consecutive internal and external cohorts, in which it achieves an improved patient-level sensitivity and lesion-level sensitivity compared to that of radiologists and expert neurosurgeons. A specific cohort of suspected acute ischemic stroke is employed and it is found that 99.0\% predicted-negative cases can be trusted with high confidence, leading to a potential reduction in human workload. A prospective study is warranted to determine whether the algorithm could improve patients’ care in comparison to clinicians’ assessment.},

This study aimed to detect cerebral hemorrhages and their locations in images using a deep learning model applying explainable deep learning. Normal brain images with no hemorrhages and images with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages according to computed tomography (CT) (n = 200) were analyzed. A ResNet deep learning model, including image processing, was utilized. The visual explanation from a heatmap was made at the hemorrhage location using a gradient-class activation map (Grad-CAM). To evaluate the performance of the deep learning system, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. A hemorrhage prediction system for images of normal brains and brains with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages was built. The Grad-CAM representation indicated the location of the hemorrhages in these images. In the prediction results, accurate predictions of the hemorrhage areas were made and visualizations of the corresponding locations overlapped in the images within (− 4, 1) pixel difference. The evaluation of the system performance showed an accuracy of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.86. These results constitue a proof of concept for the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect cerebral hemorrhages and visualize their locations in medical images, which will allow rapid diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support have been developed for clinical settings such as radiology, but little work evaluates the potential impact of such systems. In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.},

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.},

              Background
              Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
            
            
              Main body
              Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36\% female, 29\% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8\% (95\% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3\%–88.8\%) and NPV was 98.3\% (90.6\%–100\%). For the 31.8\% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4\% (91.6\%–100\%) and specificity was 78.9\% (67.6\%–87.7\%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6\% (63/122) (95\% CI 42.4\%, 60.8\%), and specificity would fall to 18.5\% (56/303) (95\% CI 14.3\%, 23.3\%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91\% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources.},

	abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).},

	abstract = {BackgroundThis paper aims to synthesise the literature on machine learning (ML) and big data applications for mental health, highlighting current research and applications in practice.MethodsWe employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field.},

In supervised machine learning, a mathematical function is constructed via automated analysis of training data, which consists of input features (such as retinal images) and output labels (such as the grade of macular edema). With large training data sets and minimal human guidance, a computer learns to generalize from the information contained in the training data. The result is a mathematical function, a model, that can be used to map a new record to the corresponding diagnosis, such as an image to grade macular edema.

The authors complement their own work with the experience of 21 machine learning products that address problems across clinical domains and across geographic populations. Four phases of translation emerge: design and develop, evaluate and validate, diffuse and scale, and continuing monitoring and maintenance. The review highlights the varying approaches taken across each phase by teams building machine learning products and presents a discussion of challenges and opportunities. The translational path and associated findings are instructive to researchers and developers building machine learning products, policy makers regulating machine learning products, and health system leaders who are considering adopting a machine learning product.},

To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jad.2018.08.073},
	abstract = {Background
No previous study has comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning algorithms in mood disorders populations. Herein, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate previous studies of machine learning-devised models that predict therapeutic outcomes in mood disorders populations.
Methods
We searched Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed from inception to February 8, 2018 for relevant studies that included adults with bipolar or unipolar depression; assessed therapeutic outcomes with a pharmacological, neuromodulatory, or manual-based psychotherapeutic intervention for depression; applied a machine learning algorithm; and reported predictors of therapeutic response. A random-effects meta-analysis of proportions and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Results
We identified 639 records: 75 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility; 26 studies (n=17,499) and 20 studies (n=6325) were included in qualitative and quantitative review, respectively. Classification algorithms were able to predict therapeutic outcomes with an overall accuracy of 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of [0.77, 0.87]). Pooled estimates of classification accuracy were significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.01) in models informed by multiple data types (e.g., composite of phenomenological patient features and neuroimaging or peripheral gene expression data; pooled proportion [95\% CI] = 0.93[0.86, 0.97]) when compared to models with lower-dimension data types (pooledproportion=0.68[0.62,0.74]to0.85[0.81,0.88]).
Limitations
Most studies were retrospective; differences in machine learning algorithms and their implementation (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning); cannot infer importance of individual variables fed into learning algorithm.
Conclusions
Machine learning algorithms provide a powerful conceptual and analytic framework capable of integrating multiple data types and sources. An integrative approach may more effectively model neurobiological components as functional modules of pathophysiology embedded within the complex, social dynamics that influence the phenomenology of mental disorders.},

Using the perspective of automation experts in other industries, three examples of automation in the delivery of routine care are reviewed: (1) effects of electronic medical records on the patient interview; (2) effects of complex systems integration on e-prescribing; and (3) use of clinical decision support to assist with clinical decision making. An increased understanding of the experience of automation from other sectors might allow for more effective deployment of technology in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks like scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such Human-AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex, creative tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to difficulties of AI systems in understanding complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here, we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop Hailey, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate Hailey in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N=300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our Human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.60\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger 38.88\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyze the Human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social, creative tasks such as empathic conversations.},

Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n=309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity, and related differentially to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline rsEEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent TMS/EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.},

Here, we report the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of robust and distinct functional-connectivity patterns, prominently within the frontoparietal-control and default-mode networks. We identified the disease subtypes by analysing, via unsupervised and supervised machine learning, the power-envelope-based connectivity of signals reconstructed from high-density resting-state electroencephalography in four datasets from patients with PTSD and MDD, and show that the subtypes are transferable across independent datasets recorded under different conditions. The subtype whose functional connectivity differed most from those of healthy controls was less responsive to psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and failed to respond to an antidepressant medication for MDD. By contrast, both subtypes responded equally well to two different forms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for MDD. Our data-driven approach may constitute a generalizable solution for connectome-based diagnosis., The analysis of functional-connectivity patterns in resting-state electroencephalography data via machine learning led to the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder.},

	abstract = {Translational models of fear conditioning and extinction have elucidated a core neural network involved in the learning, consolidation, and expression of conditioned fear and its extinction. Anxious or trauma-exposed brains are characterized by dysregulated neural activations within regions of this fear network. In this study, we examined how the functional MRI activations of 10 brain regions commonly activated during fear conditioning and extinction might distinguish anxious or trauma-exposed brains from controls. To achieve this, activations during four phases of a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in 304 participants with or without a psychiatric diagnosis were studied. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using task-specific brain activations, we reliably distinguished the anxious and trauma-exposed brains from controls. The performance of models decreased significantly when we trained our CNN using activations from task-irrelevant brain regions or from a brain network that is irrelevant to fear. Our results suggest that neuroimaging data analytics of task-induced brain activations within the fear network might provide novel prospects for development of brain-based psychiatric diagnosis.},

However, such Human-AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex, creative tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to difficulties of AI systems in understanding complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here, we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop Hailey, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate Hailey in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N=300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our Human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.60\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger 38.88\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyze the Human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social, creative tasks such as empathic conversations.},

	abstract = {Background
Death by suicide is a preventable public health concern worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the probability of suicide death using baseline characteristics and simple medical facility visit history data using Cox regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs).
Method
This study included 819,951 subjects in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)–Cohort Sample Database from 2004 to 2013. The dataset was divided randomly into two independent training and validation groups. To improve the performance of predicting suicide death, we applied SVM and DNN to the same training set as the Cox regression model.
Results
Among the study population, 2546 people died by intentional self-harm during the follow-up time. Sex, age, type of insurance, household income, disability, and medical records of eight ICD-10 codes (including mental and behavioural disorders) were selected by a Cox regression model with backward stepwise elimination. The area of under the curve (AUC) of Cox regression (0.688), SVM (0.687), and DNN (0.683) were approximately the same. The group with top .5\% of predicted probability had hazard ratio of 26.21 compared to that with the lowest 10\% of predicted probability.
Limitations
This study is limited by the lack of information on suicidal ideation and attempts, other potential covariates such as information of medication and subcategory ICD-10 codes. Moreover, predictors from the prior 12–24 months of the date of death could be expected to show better performances than predictors from up to 10 years ago.
Conclusions
We suggest a 10-year probability prediction model for suicide death using general characteristics and simple insurance data, which are annually conducted by the Korean government. Suicide death prevention might be enhanced by our prediction model.},

	abstract = {Individuals with serious mental illness experience changes in their clinical states over time that are difficult to assess and that result in increased disease burden and care utilization. It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual’s own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92\%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p{\textless}0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p{\textless}0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p{\textless}0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p{\textless}0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p{\textless}0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores. This study brings together longitudinal collection of objective behavioral markers along with a transdiagnostic, personalized approach for tracking of mental health clinical state in a community-based clinical setting.},

As technology is advancing rapidly, it is critical to understand the current state of AI applications in DP. Therefore, a patent analysis of AI in DP is required to assess the application and publication trends, major assignees, and leaders in the field. We searched five major patent databases, namely, those of the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, JPO, and CNIPA, from 1974 to 2021, using keywords such as DP, AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We discovered 6284 patents, 523 of which were used for trend analyses on time series, international distribution, top assignees; word cloud analysis; and subject category analyses. Patent filing and publication have increased exponentially over the past five years. The United States has published the most patents, followed by China and South Korea (248, 117, and 48, respectively). The top assignees were Paige.AI, Inc. (New York City, NY, USA) and Siemens, Inc. (Munich, Germany) The primary areas were whole-slide imaging, segmentation, classification, and detection. Based on these findings, we expect a surge in DP and AI patent applications focusing on the digitalization of pathological images and AI technologies that support the vital role of pathologists.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To summarise the state of the art during the year 2018 in consumer health informatics and education, with a special emphasis on the special topic of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook for 2019: “Artificial intelligence in health: new opportunities, challenges, and practical implications”.

  Methods: We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries that identified 99 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 14 were selected for consideration as best paper candidates. The 14 papers were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. Three papers that received the highest score were discussed in a consensus meeting and were agreed upon as best papers on artificial intelligence in health for patients and consumers in the year 2018.

  Results: Only a small number of 2018 papers reported Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for patients and consumers. No studies were found on AI applications designed specifically for patients or consumers, nor were there studies that elicited patient and consumer input on AI. Currently, the most common use of AI for patients and consumers lies in secondary analysis of social media data (e.g., online discussion forums). In particular, the three best papers shared a common methodology of using data-driven algorithms (such as text mining, topic modelling, Latent Dirichlet allocation modelling), combined with insight-led approaches (e.g., visualisation, qualitative analysis and manual review), to uncover patient and consumer experiences of health and illness in online communities.

  Conclusions: While discussion remains active on how AI could 'revolutionise' healthcare delivery, there is a lack of direction and evidence on how AI could actually benefit patients and consumers. Perhaps instead of primarily focusing on data and algorithms, researchers should engage with patients and consumers early in the AI research agenda to ensure we are indeed asking the right questions, and that important use cases and critical contexts are identified together with patients and consumers. Without a clear understanding on why patients and consumers need AI in the first place, or how AI could support individuals with their healthcare needs, it is difficult to imagine the kinds of AI applications that would have meaningful and sustainable impact on individual daily lives.},

	abstract = {Introduction: 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises.

Objective:
Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media.

Methodology:
We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis.

Results:
Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common.

Conclusions:
The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis.},

Here, we investigate if there is prospective evidence for biomarkers derived from leading theories. We focus on neuroimaging, gastrointestinal factors, immunology, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and oxidative stress. Searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo for articles published up to 06/2019. References and citations of included articles were screened to identify additional articles. Inclusion criteria were having an MDD diagnosis as outcome, a biomarker as predictor, and prospective design search terms were formulated accordingly. PRISMA guidelines were applied. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effect model when three or more comparable studies were identified, using a random effect model. Our search resulted in 67,464 articles, of which 75 prospective articles were identified on: Neuroimaging (N = 24), Gastrointestinal factors (N = 1), Immunology (N = 8), Neurotrophic (N = 2), Neurotransmitters (N = 1), Hormones (N = 39), Oxidative stress (N = 1). Meta-analyses on brain volumes and immunology markers were not significant. Only cortisol (N = 19, OR = 1.294, p = 0.024) showed a predictive effect on onset/relapse/recurrence of MDD, but not on time until MDD onset/relapse/recurrence. However, this effect disappeared when studies including participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis were removed from the analyses. Other studies were too heterogeneous to compare. Thus, there is a lack of evidence for leading biological theories for onset and maintenance of depression. Only cortisol was identified as potential predictor for MDD, but results are influenced by the disease state. High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.},

The top five ethical arguments against engagement in online psychotherapy were (1) privacy, confidentiality, and security issues; (2) therapist competence and need for special training; (3) communication issues specific to technology; (4) research gaps; and (5) emergency issues.ConclusionsThe findings may be of help to practitioners in deciding whether to engage in online psychotherapy, and in informing patients about risks and benefits, improving ethical guidelines, and stimulating further ethical discussion. The findings are argumentative and qualitative in nature, and further quantitative research is needed.},

Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83\% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90\% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy.},

	abstract = {The technology for evaluating patient-provider interactions in psychotherapy–observational coding–has not changed in 70 years. It is labor-intensive, error prone, and expensive, limiting its use in evaluating psychotherapy in the real world. Engineering solutions from speech and language processing provide new methods for the automatic evaluation of provider ratings from session recordings. The primary data are 200 Motivational Interviewing (MI) sessions from a study on MI training methods with observer ratings of counselor empathy. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) was used to transcribe sessions, and the resulting words were used in a text-based predictive model of empathy. Two supporting datasets trained the speech processing tasks including ASR (1200 transcripts from heterogeneous psychotherapy sessions and 153 transcripts and session recordings from 5 MI clinical trials). The accuracy of computationally-derived empathy ratings were evaluated against human ratings for each provider. Computationally-derived empathy scores and classifications (high vs. low) were highly accurate against human-based codes and classifications, with a correlation of 0.65 and F-score (a weighted average of sensitivity and specificity) of 0.86, respectively. Empathy prediction using human transcription as input (as opposed to ASR) resulted in a slight increase in prediction accuracies, suggesting that the fully automatic system with ASR is relatively robust. Using speech and language processing methods, it is possible to generate accurate predictions of provider performance in psychotherapy from audio recordings alone. This technology can support large-scale evaluation of psychotherapy for dissemination and process studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective: This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods: Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results: From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions: We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.},

We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.},

	abstract = {Mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for modeling fixed and random effects simultaneously, but do not offer a feasible analytic solution for estimating the probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis. Being able to estimate this probability, however, is critical for sample size planning, as power is closely linked to the reliability and replicability of empirical findings. A flexible and very intuitive alternative to analytic power solutions are simulation-based power analyses. Although various tools for conducting simulation-based power analyses for mixed-effects models are available, there is lack of guidance on how to appropriately use them. In this tutorial, we discuss how to estimate power for mixed-effects models in different use cases: first, how to use models that were fit on available (e.g. published) data to determine sample size; second, how to determine the number of stimuli required for sufficient power; and finally, how to conduct sample size planning without available data. Our examples cover both linear and generalized linear models and we provide code and resources for performing simulation-based power analyses on openly accessible data sets. The present work therefore helps researchers to navigate sound research design when using mixed-effects models, by summarizing resources, collating available knowledge, providing solutions and tools, and applying them to real-world problems in sample sizing planning when sophisticated analysis procedures like mixed-effects models are outlined as inferential procedures.},

In this paper, we focused on recent meta-analytic reviews of the literature and found moderate to large effects reported for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression. In total, we reviewed 9 recent meta-analytic reviews out of a total of 618 meta-analytic reviews identified using our search terms. In these selected reviews, 166 studies were included, including overlap in reviews on similar conditions. We also covered a recent review on transdiagnostic treatments and 2 reviews on face-to-face v. internet treatment. The growing number of meta-analytic reviews of studies now suggests that ICBT works and can be as effective as face-to-face therapy.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital health apps are efficacious treatment options for mild-to-moderate depressive disorders. However, the extent to which psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial.
Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions.
Methods: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy–based intervention for depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory.
Results: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1\%) completed the intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed significantly between groups at the postintervention (F2,398=37.20, P\&lt;.001). The reductions in scores for both guided and unguided intervention groups were greater than that for the control group, with large between-group effect sizes (guided vs control: d=1.63, 95\% CI 1.37 to 1.93; unguided vs control: d=1.47, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.73) at postintervention. No significant differences were found between guided and unguided intervention groups (P=.18). At follow-up (6 months), treatment effects on the primary outcome were maintained for both intervention groups (guided: F1,194=0.62, P\&gt;.999; unguided: F1,176=0.13, P\&gt;.999).
Conclusions: Both guided and unguided versions of the intervention were highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Follow-up data suggest that these effects could be maintained. The guided version was not superior to the unguided version.

	abstract = {Background. Little is known about potential harmful effects as a consequence of self-guided internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT), such as symptom deterioration rates. Thus, safety concerns remain and hamper the implementation of self-guided iCBT into clinical practice. We aimed to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of clinically significant deterioration (symptom worsening) in adults with depressive symptoms who received self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions. Several socio-demographic, clinical and study-level variables were tested as potential moderators of deterioration.
Methods. Randomised controlled trials that reported results of self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions in adults with symptoms of depression were selected. Mixed effects models with participants nested within studies were used to examine possible clinically significant deterioration rates.
Results. Thirteen out of 16 eligible trials were included in the present IPD meta-analysis. Of the 3805 participants analysed, 7.2\% showed clinically significant deterioration (5.8\% and 9.1\% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively). Participants in self-guided iCBT were less likely to deteriorate (OR 0.62, p {\textless} 0.001) compared with control conditions. None of the examined participant- and study-level moderators were significantly associated with deterioration rates.
Conclusions. Self-guided iCBT has a lower rate of negative outcomes on symptoms than control conditions and could be a first step treatment approach for adult depression as well as an alternative to watchful waiting in general practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Mental health disorders affect 1 in 10 people globally, of whom approximately 300 million are affected by depression. At least half of the people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces.
Objective: This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores.
Methods: We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics.
Results: The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79\% (77/98) of the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, whereas 17\% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19–related information. Although most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it before account creation. In total, 82\% (74/90) of privacy policies stated sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development teams included academic institutions or health care providers.
Conclusions: Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users’ data is widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users’ data security.

            Progress in developing personalised care for mental disorders is supported by numerous proof-of-concept machine learning studies in the area of risk assessment, diagnostics and precision prescribing. Most of these studies primarily use clinical data, but models might benefit from additional neuroimaging, blood and genetic data to improve accuracy. Combined, multimodal models might offer potential for stratification of patients for treatment. Clinical implementation of machine learning is impeded by a lack of wider generalisability, with efforts primarily focused on psychosis and dementia. Studies across all diagnostic groups should work to test the robustness of machine learning models, which is an essential first step to clinical implementation, and then move to prospective clinical validation. Models need to exceed clinicians’ heuristics to be useful, and safe, in routine decision-making. Engagement of clinicians, researchers and patients in digitalisation and ‘big data’ approaches are vital to allow the generation and accessibility of large, longitudinal, prospective data needed for precision psychiatry to be applied into real-world psychiatric care.},

              Background
              The impact of precision psychiatry for clinical practice has not been systematically appraised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected with a condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding to treatments (predictive) in mental disorders.
            
            
              Methods
              PRISMA/RIGHT/CHARMS-compliant systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713) to identify diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported individualized estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally validated or implemented. Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the impact of several factors on the accuracy of prediction models.
            
            
              Findings
              Literature search identified 584 prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4\% of the total studies included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6\% models externally validated (n = 27), and 0.2\% (n = 1) models considered for implementation. Across validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2\% were diagnostic, 68.2\% prognostic, and 13.6\% predictive. The most frequently investigated condition was psychosis (36.4\%), and the most frequently employed predictors clinical (69.5\%). Unimodal compared to multimodal models (β = .29, P = .03) and diagnostic compared to prognostic (β = .84, p \&lt; .0001) and predictive (β = .87, P = .002) models were associated with increased accuracy.
            
            
              Interpretation
              To date, several validated prediction models are available to support the diagnosis and prognosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular, psychosis, or to predict treatment response. Advancements of knowledge are limited by the lack of implementation research in real-world clinical practice. A new generation of implementation research is required to address this translational gap.},

	abstract = {Several barriers complicate access to psychotherapy for depression, including time commitment, location of services, and stigma. Digital treatment has the potential to address these barriers, yet long term use of digital psychotherapy is poor. This paper presents data from a mixed-methods, online survey to document concerns patients with depression face when given the choice of in-person psychotherapy and digital psychotherapy. Participants were 164 adults living in the United States who had previously used or considered psychotherapy for depression. Rural-dwelling and racial/ethnic minority (Native American, African American, and Spanish-speaking) respondents were purposively sampled. Participants were asked their preferences for and opinions about four treatment modalities: self-guided digital, peer-supported digital, expert-guided digital, or in-person psychotherapy. Less than half (44.5\%) of participants preferred in-person psychotherapy, 25.6\% preferred self-guided digital treatment, 19.7\% preferred expert-guided digital treatment, and 8.5\% peer-supported digital treatment. Principal themes extracted from qualitative analysis centered on the efficacy of digital treatment, access to digital treatment, concerns about peer-supported care, confidentiality and privacy concerns, preference for in-person treatment, skepticism about self-guided therapy, and the impact of social anxiety on the use of video-chat based care. Future development of digital psychotherapy will need to address concerns regarding efficacy, privacy, data security, and methods to enhance motivation to use these treatments.},

	abstract = {Background. It is well known that web-based interventions can be effective treatments for depression. However, dropout rates in web-based interventions are typically high, especially in self-guided web-based interventions. Rigorous empirical evidence regarding factors inﬂuencing dropout in self-guided web-based interventions is lacking due to small study sample sizes. In this paper we examined predictors of dropout in an individual patient data meta-analysis to gain a better understanding of who may beneﬁt from these interventions.
Method. A comprehensive literature search for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy for adults with depression from 2006 to January 2013 was conducted. Next, we approached authors to collect the primary data of the selected studies. Predictors of dropout, such as socio-demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics were examined.
Results. Data from 2705 participants across ten RCTs of self-guided web-based interventions for depression were analysed. The multivariate analysis indicated that male gender [relative risk (RR) 1.08], lower educational level (primary education, RR 1.26) and co-morbid anxiety symptoms (RR 1.18) signiﬁcantly increased the risk of dropping out, while for every additional 4 years of age, the risk of dropping out signiﬁcantly decreased (RR 0.94).
Conclusions. Dropout can be predicted by several variables and is not randomly distributed. This knowledge may inform tailoring of online self-help interventions to prevent dropout in identiﬁed groups at risk.},

	abstract = {Background. Little is known about potential harmful effects as a consequence of self-guided internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT), such as symptom deterioration rates. Thus, safety concerns remain and hamper the implementation of self-guided iCBT into clinical practice. We aimed to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of clinically significant deterioration (symptom worsening) in adults with depressive symptoms who received self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions. Several socio-demographic, clinical and study-level variables were tested as potential moderators of deterioration.
Methods. Randomised controlled trials that reported results of self-guided iCBT compared with control conditions in adults with symptoms of depression were selected. Mixed effects models with participants nested within studies were used to examine possible clinically significant deterioration rates.
Results. Thirteen out of 16 eligible trials were included in the present IPD meta-analysis. Of the 3805 participants analysed, 7.2\% showed clinically significant deterioration (5.8\% and 9.1\% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively). Participants in self-guided iCBT were less likely to deteriorate (OR 0.62, p {\textless} 0.001) compared with control conditions. None of the examined participant- and study-level moderators were significantly associated with deterioration rates.
Conclusions. Self-guided iCBT has a lower rate of negative outcomes on symptoms than control conditions and could be a first step treatment approach for adult depression as well as an alternative to watchful waiting in general practice.},

New strategies are required to realise their potential. Aims To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people with depression and anxiety. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7). Results Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58\% vs. 35\%), and improved outcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms. Conclusions The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails facilitated outcomes. Further attention to strategies that facilitate adherence, learning, and safety will help realise the potential of self-guided interventions.

	abstract = {Background A recent paper reported the outcomes of a study examining a new self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for symptoms of anxiety or depression. This study found the intervention resulted in significant symptom reductions. It also found that automated emails increased treatment completion and clinical improvements in a subsample with elevated anxiety and depression. Aims To examine the clinical outcomes and the effect of automated emails at 12 months post-treatment. Method Participants, who were randomly allocated to a Treatment Plus Automated Emails Group (TEG; n = 100), a standard Treatment Group (TG; n = 106) or delayed-treatment Waitlist Control Group (Control; n = 51), were followed up at 12 months post-treatment. Eighty-one percent, 78\% and 87\% of participants in the TEG, TG and treated Waitlist Control Group provided symptom data at 12-month follow-up, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (GAD-7). Results Significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed over time in both the TEG and TG (Fs {\textgreater}69, ps {\textless}.001) these were sustained from post-treatment to 12-month follow-up (ps {\textgreater}.05), and were associated with large effect sizes. No statistically significant differences in symptoms were found between the TEG and TG at post-treatment, 3-month or 12-month follow-up. Previously reported symptom differences between TEG and TG participants with comorbid symptoms were no longer present at 12-month follow-up (ps {\textgreater}.70). Conclusions The overall benefits of the Wellbeing Course were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Although automated emails facilitated Course completion and reductions in symptoms for participants with comorbid anxiety and depression from pre-post treatment, these differences were no longer observed at 12-month follow-up. The results indicate that automated emails promote more rapid treatment response for people with elevated and comorbid symptoms, but may not improve longer term outcomes.

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F₁and F₂tests, and in many cases, even worse than F₁alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100\%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objective:The aim of this review was to explore the current evidence for conversational agents or chatbots in the field of psychiatry and their role in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses.Methods:A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders.Results:From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment.Conclusion:Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.},

Depression and mental illness are a key problem in society nowadays. It can cause a loss of interest in general activities that can lead to suicidal thoughts. Hence, the need of an automated system that can help in detecting depression in people of various age groups is being realized. In order to detect depression,Researchers have been looking for approaches to effectively identify depression. A number of studies have been proposed in this regard. Here, In this study, we are analysing various existing studies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and diverse Machine Learning (ML) techniques being used to detect depression. Apart from it, different approaches used to detect emotion and mood in an individual are discussed. This study analyses how facial expressions, images, emotional chatbots and texts on social media platforms can be effectual in detecting one’s emotions and then depression. Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) – Radial Neural Networks (RNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector, etc. are the various ML techniques used to recognize emotions from text processing; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for feature extraction and classifications of images to detect emotions through facial expressions. This paper aims to provide the survey of various AI and ML techniques which help in the detection and analysis of emotion and hence depression along with their related research issues.},

Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing. AI technology, still nascent in healthcare, has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice.
Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice.
Methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.
Results: We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.
Conclusions: This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.},

App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm, substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64\%) claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44\%), although this included techniques not validated by literature searches (8/24 = 33\%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14\%) described design or development involving lived experience, and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess undergraduate medical students’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology and medicine. Materials and methods Aweb-based questionnaire was designed using SurveyMonkey, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students’ prior knowledge of AI in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards AI in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured.
Results A total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52\% were aware of the ongoing discussion about AI in radiology and 68\% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83\%) but felt that AI would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56\%). The majority agreed that AI will revolutionise and improve radiology (77\% and 86\%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83\%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for AI to be included in medical training (71\%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of AI and less fearful of these technologies.
Conclusion Contrary to anecdotes published in the media, undergraduate medical students do not worry that AI will replace human radiologists, and are aware of the potential applications and implications of AI on radiology and medicine. Radiology should take the lead in educating students about these emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {Background Hospital staff is at high risk of developing mental health issues during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the literature lacks an overall and inclusive picture of mental health problems with comprehensive analysis among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives To ascertain the prevalence of anxiety, depression and other mental health outcomes as reported in original articles among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE 2000 compliant umbrella review of published meta-analyses of observational studies evaluating the prevalence of mental health problems in hospital staff during the pandemic. Review methods Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from December 1st, 2019, until August 13th 2021. The random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias using Egger test and LFK index was examined. Data was analyzed using STATA 17.0 software. AMSTAR-2 was applied for the quality assessment of systematic reviews, while we used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence. Results Forty-four meta-analyses from 1298 individual studies were included in the final analysis, encompassing the prevalence of 16 mental health symptoms. One-third of hospital workers reported anxiety (Prevalence: 29.9\%, 95\% CI:27.1\% to 32.7\%) and depression (Prevalence: 28.4\%, 95\% CI:25.5\% to 31.3\%) symptomatology, while about 40\% (95\% CI: 36.9\% to 42.0\%) suffered from sleeping disorders. Fear-related symptoms, reduced well-being, poor quality of life, and acute stress symptoms had the highest prevalence among hospital staff. However, the quality of evidence in these areas varied from low to very low. Nurses suffered more often from sleep problems and symptoms of anxiety and depression than doctors, whereas doctors reported a higher prevalence of acute stress and post-traumatic disorders. The burden of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders was higher among female employees than their male counterparts. Remarkably, acute stress and insomnia affected more than half of first-line medical staff. Conclusions The prevalence of mental health problems among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is generally high, with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms representing the most robust evidence based on a large dataset of prevalence meta-analyses. However, there is no strong confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome assessed. Registration Not registered.

There is mounting evidence that the technology fueled by ML has the potential to detect and substantially improve treatment of complex mental disorders such as depression. We developed a framework capable of detecting depression with minimal human intervention: artificial intelligence mental evaluation (AiME). This framework consists of a short human-computer interactive evaluation that utilizes artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, and can predict whether the participant is depressed or not with satisfactory performance. Because of its ease of use, this technology can offer a viable tool for mental health professionals to identify symptoms of depression, thus enabling a faster preventative intervention. Furthermore, it may alleviate the challenge of observing and interpreting highly nuanced physiological and behavioral biomarkers of depression by providing a more objective evaluation.

Despite negative effects on mothers’ and children’s health, many women do not receive adequate care. Preventive interventions are cost-efficient among high-risk women, but our ability to identify these is poor. We leveraged the power of clinical, demographic, and psychometric data to assess if machine learning methods can make accurate predictions of postpartum depression. Data were obtained from a population-based prospective cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden, collected between 2009 and 2018 (BASIC study, n = 4313). Sub-analyses among women without previous depression were performed. The extremely randomized trees method provided robust performance with highest accuracy and well-balanced sensitivity and specificity (accuracy 73\%, sensitivity 72\%, specificity 75\%, positive predictive value 33\%, negative predictive value 94\%, area under the curve 81\%). Among women without earlier mental health issues, the accuracy was 64\%. The variables setting women at most risk for PPD were depression and anxiety during pregnancy, as well as variables related to resilience and personality. Future clinical models that could be implemented directly after delivery might consider including these variables in order to identify women at high risk for postpartum depression to facilitate individualized follow-up and cost-effectiveness.},

However, patients with mental illnesses who present similar behavior may be diagnosed differently, which is why a personalized study of each patient is necessary. Following previous promising results in the detection of depression, in this work, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to classify the different states of patients diagnosed with bipolar depressive disorder (BDD). The purpose of this study was to provide relevant information to medical staff and patients’ relatives in order to help them make decisions that may lead to a better management of the disease. The information used was collected from BDD patients through wearable devices (smartwatches), daily self-reports, and medical observation at regular appointments. The variables were processed and then statistical techniques of data analysis, normalization, noise reduction, and feature selection were applied. An individual analysis of each patient was carried out. Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine algorithms were applied with different configurations. The results allowed us to draw some conclusions. Random Forest achieved the most accurate classification, but none of the applied models were the best technique for all patients. Besides, the classification using only selected variables produced better results than using all available information, though the amount and source of the relevant variables differed for each patient. Finally, the smartwatch was the most relevant source of information.},

	abstract = {Background: The lack of access to mental health care could be addressed, in part, through the development of automated screening technologies for detecting the most common mental health disorders without the direct involvement of clinicians. Objective smartphone-collected data may contain sufficient information about individuals’ behaviors to infer their mental states and therefore screen for anxiety disorders and depression.
Objective: The objective of this study is to compare how a single set of recognized and novel features, extracted from smartphone-collected data, can be used for predicting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and depression.
Methods: An Android app was designed, together with a centralized server system, to collect periodic measurements of objective smartphone data. The types of data included samples of ambient audio, GPS location, screen state, and light sensor data. Subjects were recruited into a 2-week observational study in which the app was run on their personal smartphones. The subjects also completed self-report severity measures of SAD, GAD, and depression. The participants were 112 Canadian adults from a nonclinical population. High-level features were extracted from the data of 84 participants, and predictive models of SAD, GAD, and depression were built and evaluated.
Results: Models of SAD and depression achieved a significantly greater screening accuracy than uninformative models (area under the receiver operating characteristic means of 0.64, SD 0.13 and 0.72, SD 0.12, respectively), whereas models of GAD failed to be predictive. Investigation of the model coefficients revealed key features that were predictive of SAD and depression.
Conclusions: We demonstrate the ability of a common set of features to act as predictors in the models of both SAD and depression. This suggests that the types of behaviors that can be inferred from smartphone-collected data are broad indicators of mental health, which can be used to study, assess, and track psychopathology simultaneously across multiple disorders and diagnostic boundaries.},

Stakeholder feedback may facilitate adoption of such tools. This evaluation gathered stakeholder feedback and preferences to explore whether it would be fundamentally feasible or possible to implement an automated fidelity-scoring supervision tool in community mental health settings. A partially mixed, sequential research method design was used including focus group discussions with community mental health therapists (n = 18) and clinical leadership (n = 12) to explore typical supervision practices, followed by discussion of an automated fidelity feedback tool embedded in a cloud-based supervision platform. Interpretation of qualitative findings was enhanced through quantitative measures of participants’ use of technology and perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the tool. Initial perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of automated fidelity tools were positive and increased after introduction of an automated tool. Standard supervision was described as collaboratively guided and focused on clinical content, self-care, and documentation. Participants highlighted the tool’s utility for supervision, training, and professional growth, but questioned its ability to evaluate rapport, cultural responsiveness, and non-verbal communication. Concerns were raised about privacy and the impact of low scores on therapist confidence. Desired features included intervention labeling and transparency about how scores related to session content. Opportunities for asynchronous, remote, and targeted supervision were particularly valued. Stakeholder feedback suggests that automated fidelity measurement could augment supervision practices. Future research should examine the relations among use of such supervision tools, clinician skill, and client outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{\textless}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{\textless}.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance–based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31\% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy are leading, evidence-based practices for a variety of problems (e.g., substance abuse), but the evaluation of provider fidelity to behavioral interventions is limited by the need for human judgment. The current study evaluated the accuracy of statistical text classification in replicating human-based judgments of provider fidelity in one specific psychotherapy--motivational interviewing (MI).
METHOD: Participants (n = 148) came from five previously conducted randomized trials and were either primary care patients at a safety-net hospital or university students. To be eligible for the original studies, participants met criteria for either problematic drug or alcohol use. All participants received a type of brief motivational interview, an evidence-based intervention for alcohol and substance use disorders. The Motivational Interviewing Skills Code is a standard measure of MI provider fidelity based on human ratings that was used to evaluate all therapy sessions. A text classification approach called a labeled topic model was used to learn associations between human-based fidelity ratings and MI session transcripts. It was then used to generate codes for new sessions. The primary comparison was the accuracy of model-based codes with human-based codes.
RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of model-based codes showed reasonably strong sensitivity and specificity with those from human raters (range of area under ROC curve (AUC) scores: 0.62 - 0.81; average AUC: 0.72). Agreement with human raters was evaluated based on talk turns as well as code tallies for an entire session. Generated codes had higher reliability with human codes for session tallies and also varied strongly by individual code.
CONCLUSION: To scale up the evaluation of behavioral interventions, technological solutions will be required. The current study demonstrated preliminary, encouraging findings regarding the utility of statistical text classification in bridging this methodological gap.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.},

In Motivational Interviewing (MI), a treatment that directs the therapist to utilize a particular linguistic style, proficiency is assessed via behavioral coding-a time consuming, nontechnological approach. Natural language processing techniques have the potential to scale up the evaluation of behavioral treatments such as MI. We present a novel computational approach to assessing components of MI, focusing on 1 specific counselor behavior-reflections, which are believed to be a critical MI ingredient. Using 57 sessions from 3 MI clinical trials, we automatically detected counselor reflections in a maximum entropy Markov modeling framework using the raw linguistic data derived from session transcripts. We achieved 93\% recall, 90\% specificity, and 73\% precision. Results provide insight into the linguistic information used by coders to make ratings and demonstrate the feasibility of new computational approaches to scaling up the evaluation of behavioral treatments.},

	abstract = {Online peer-to-peer support platforms enable conversations between millions of people who seek and provide mental health support. If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity, and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation. This work has direct implications for facilitating empathic conversations on web-based platforms.},

              Aim 
              This study will evaluate radiation medicine professionals’ perceptions of clinical and professional risks and benefits, and the evolving roles and responsibilities with artificial intelligence (AI). 
             
             
              Methods 
              Radiation oncologists (ROs), medical physicists (MPs), treatment planners (TP-RTTs) and treatment delivery radiation therapists (TD-RTTs) at a cancer centre in preliminary stages of implementing an AI-enabled treatment planning system were invited to participate in uniprofessional focus groups. Semi-structured scripts addressed the perceptions of AI, including thoughts regarding changing roles and competencies. Sessions were audiorecorded, transcribed and coded thematically through consensus-building. 
             
             
              Results 
              A total of 24 participants (four ROs, five MPs, seven TP-RTTs and eight TD-RTTs) were engaged in four focus groups of 58 minutes average duration (range 54–61 minutes). Emergent themes addressed AI’s impact on quality of care, changing professional tasks and changing competency requirements. Time-consuming repetitive tasks such as delineating targets, generating treatment plans and quality assurance were thought conducive to offloading to AI. Outcomes data and adaptive planning would be incorporated into clinical decision-making. Changing workload would necessitate changing skills, prioritising plan evaluation over generation and increasing interprofessional communication. All groups discussed AI reducing the need for TP-RTTs, though displacement was thought more likely than replacement. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              It is important to consider how professionals perceive AI to be proactive in informing change, as gains in quality and efficiency will require new workflows, skills and education.},

              Background 
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) innovations in radiology offer a potential solution to the increasing demand for imaging tests and the ongoing workforce crisis. Crucial to their adoption is the involvement of different professional groups, namely radiologists and radiographers, who work interdependently but whose perceptions and responses towards AI may differ. We aim to explore the knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards AI amongst professional groups in radiology, and to analyse the implications for the future adoption of these technologies into practice. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with 12 radiologists and 6 radiographers from four breast units in National Health Services (NHS) organisations and one focus group with 8 radiographers from a fifth NHS breast unit, between 2018 and 2020. 
             
             
              Results 
              We found that radiographers and radiologists vary with respect to their awareness and knowledge around AI. Through their professional networks, conference attendance, and contacts with industry developers, radiologists receive more information and acquire more knowledge of the potential applications of AI. Radiographers instead rely more on localized personal networks for information. Our results also show that although both groups believe AI innovations offer a potential solution to workforce shortages, they differ significantly regarding the impact they believe it will have on their professional roles. Radiologists believe AI has the potential to take on more repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on more interesting and challenging work. They are less concerned that AI technology might constrain their professional role and autonomy. Radiographers showed greater concern about the potential impact that AI technology could have on their roles and skills development. They were less confident of their ability to respond positively to the potential risks and opportunities posed by AI technology. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              In summary, our findings suggest that professional responses to AI are linked to existing work roles, but are also mediated by differences in knowledge and attitudes attributable to inter-professional differences in status and identity. These findings question broad-brush assertions about the future deskilling impact of AI which neglect the need for AI innovations in healthcare to be integrated into existing work processes subject to high levels of professional autonomy.},

	abstract = {Background: The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields. Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs’ opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians’ judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.},

              Introduction 
              Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields in various sectors, including healthcare. This article reviews AI’s present applications in healthcare, including its benefits, limitations and future scope. 
             
             
              Sources of data 
              A review of the English literature was conducted with search terms ‘AI’ or ‘ML’ or ‘deep learning’ and ‘healthcare’ or ‘medicine’ using PubMED and Google Scholar from 2000–2021. 
             
             
              Areas of agreement 
              AI could transform physician workflow and patient care through its applications, from assisting physicians and replacing administrative tasks to augmenting medical knowledge. 
             
             
              Areas of controversy 
              From challenges training ML systems to unclear accountability, AI’s implementation is difficult and incremental at best. Physicians also lack understanding of what AI implementation could represent. 
             
             
              Growing points 
              AI can ultimately prove beneficial in healthcare, but requires meticulous governance similar to the governance of physician conduct. 
             
             
              Areas timely for developing research 
              Regulatory guidelines are needed on how to safely implement and assess AI technology, alongside further research into the specific capabilities and limitations of its medical use.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital health has the potential to support care delivery for chronic illness. Despite positive evidence from localized implementations, new technologies have proven slow to become accepted, integrated, and routinized at scale. Objective: The aim of our study was to examine barriers and facilitators to implementation of digital health at scale through the evaluation of a £37m national digital health program: ‟Delivering Assisted Living Lifestyles at Scale” (dallas) from 2012-2015. Methods: The study was a longitudinal qualitative, multi-stakeholder, implementation study. The methods included interviews (n=125) with key implementers, focus groups with consumers and patients (n=7), project meetings (n=12), field work or observation in the communities (n=16), health professional survey responses (n=48), and cross program documentary evidence on implementation (n=215). We used a sociological theory called normalization process theory (NPT) and a longitudinal (3 years) qualitative framework analysis approach. This work did not study a single intervention or population. Instead, we evaluated the processes (of designing and delivering digital health), and our outcomes were the identified barriers and facilitators to delivering and mainstreaming services and products within the mixed sector digital health ecosystem. Results: We identified three main levels of issues influencing readiness for digital health: macro (market, infrastructure, policy), meso (organizational), and micro (professional or public). Factors hindering implementation included: lack of information technology (IT) infrastructure, uncertainty around information governance, lack of incentives to prioritize interoperability, lack of precedence on accountability within the commercial sector, and a market perceived as difficult to navigate. Factors enabling implementation were: clinical endorsement, champions who promoted digital health, and public and professional willingness. Conclusions: Although there is receptiveness to digital health, barriers to mainstreaming remain. Our findings suggest greater investment in national and local infrastructure, implementation of guidelines for the safe and transparent use and assessment of digital health, incentivization of interoperability, and investment in upskilling of professionals and the public would help support the normalization of digital health. These findings will enable researchers, health care practitioners, and policy makers to understand the current landscape and the actions required in order to prepare the market and accelerate uptake, and use of digital health and wellness services in context and at scale.},

Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called ‘telehealth’. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise. In order to facilitate further discussion about the ethical principles and responsibilities of educational system in healthcare using AI and to potentially arrive at a consensus concerning safe and desirable uses of AI in healthcare education, this paper performs an evaluation of the self-imposed AI ethical guidelines identifying the common principles and approaches as well as drawbacks limiting the practical and legal application of internal policies.

              Background/Introduction 
              Artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare sector is receiving attention from researchers and health professionals. Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. 
             
             
              Methods 
              The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. 
             
             
              Results 
              The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND 
            New artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being developed at a high speed. However, strategies and practical experiences surrounding the adoption and implementation of AI in health care are lacking. This is likely because of the high implementation complexity of AI, legacy IT infrastructure, and unclear business cases, thus complicating AI adoption. Research has recently started to identify the factors influencing AI readiness of organizations. 
           
           
            OBJECTIVE 
            This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing AI readiness as well as possible barriers to AI adoption and implementation in German hospitals. We also assessed the status quo regarding the dissemination of AI tools in hospitals. We focused on IT decision makers, a seldom studied but highly relevant group. 
           
           
            METHODS 
            We created a web-based survey based on recent AI readiness and implementation literature. Participants were identified through a publicly accessible database and contacted via email or invitational leaflets sent by mail, in some cases accompanied by a telephonic prenotification. The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
           
           
            RESULTS 
            We contacted 609 possible participants, and our database recorded 40 completed surveys. Most participants agreed or rather agreed with the statement that AI would be relevant in the future, both in Germany (37/40, 93\%) and in their own hospital (36/40, 90\%). Participants were asked whether their hospitals used or planned to use AI technologies. Of the 40 participants, 26 (65\%) answered “yes.” Most AI technologies were used or planned for patient care, followed by biomedical research, administration, and logistics and central purchasing. The most important barriers to AI were lack of resources (staff, knowledge, and financial). Relevant possible opportunities for using AI were increase in efficiency owing to time-saving effects, competitive advantages, and increase in quality of care. Most AI tools in use or in planning have been developed with external partners. 
           
           
            CONCLUSIONS 
            Few tools have been implemented in routine care, and many hospitals do not use or plan to use AI in the future. This can likely be explained by missing or unclear business cases or the need for a modern IT infrastructure to integrate AI tools in a usable manner. These shortcomings complicate decision-making and resource attribution. As most AI technologies already in use were developed in cooperation with external partners, these relationships should be fostered. IT decision makers should assess their hospitals’ readiness for AI individually with a focus on resources. Further research should continue to monitor the dissemination of AI tools and readiness factors to determine whether improvements can be made over time. This monitoring is especially important with regard to government-supported investments in AI technologies that could alleviate financial burdens. Qualitative studies with hospital IT decision makers should be conducted to further explore the reasons for slow AI.},

Participants’ level of knowledge and stigma were recorded through pre- and post-tests using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and the Opinions about Mental Illness (OMI) scale. Information about mental illness was provided between conditions followed by a distractor task. Responses were calculated and combined to give an overall score. A sign test with continuity correction was used to see whether there was a difference in attitudes. The pre- and post-test conditions were scored. Results demonstrate a statistically significant median decrease in stigma in the post-test condition (p = 0.03).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards AI and to provide information about their opinions to use of AI in dentistry. Methods A 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 ± 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69\% response rate. Of these, about 48.40\% had basic knowledge about AI technologies and 10.6\% stated that they had no information sources about AI. 85.70\% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by AI but 28.60\% did not agree that AI could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60\% and 79.80\% of agreed on topics about AI to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively.

	abstract = {Objectives
We investigated the attitudes of radiologists, information technology (IT) specialists, and industry representatives on artificial intelligence (AI) and its future impact on radiological work.

Materials and Methods
During a national meeting for AI, eHealth, and IT infrastructure in 2019, we conducted a survey to obtain participants’ attitudes. A total of 123 participants completed 28 items exploring AI usage in medicine. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between radiologists, IT specialists, and industry representatives.

Results
The strongest agreement between all respondents occurred with the following: plausibility checks are important to understand the decisions of the AI (93\% agreement), validation of AI algorithms is mandatory (91\%), and medicine becomes more efficient in the age of AI (86\%). In contrast, only 25\% of the respondents had confidence in the AI results, and only 17\% believed that medicine will become more human through the use of AI. The answers were significantly different between the three professions for four items: relevance for protocol selection in cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.034), medical societies should be involved in validation (p = 0.028), patients should be informed about the use of AI (p = 0.047), and AI should be part of medical education (p = 0.026).

Conclusion
Currently, a discrepancy exists between high expectations for the future role of AI and low confidence in the results. This attitude was similar across all three groups. The demand for plausibility checks and the need to prove the usefulness in randomized controlled studies indicate what is needed in future research.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the clinical practice of radiology. This study investigated Canadian medical students’ perceptions of the impact of AI on radiology, and their influence on the students’ preference for radiology specialty.
Materials and Methods
In March 2018, an anonymous online survey was distributed to students at all 17 Canadian medical schools.
Results
Among 322 respondents, 70 students considered radiology as the top specialty choice, and 133 as among the top three choices. Only a minority (29.3\%) of respondents agreed AI would replace radiologists in foreseeable future, but a majority (67.7\%) agreed AI would reduce the demand for radiologists. Even among first-choice respondents, 48.6\% agreed AI caused anxiety when considering the radiology specialty. Furthermore, one-sixth of respondents who would otherwise rank radiology as the first choice would not consider radiology because of the anxiety about AI. Prior significant exposure to radiology and high confidence in understanding of AI were shown to decrease the anxiety level. Interested students valued the opinions of local radiologists, radiology conferences, and journals. Students were most interested in “expert opinions on AI” and “discussing AI in preclinical radiology lectures” to understand the impact of AI.
Conclusion
Anxiety related to “displacement” (not “replacement”) of radiologists by AI discouraged many medical students from considering the radiology specialty. The radiology community should educate medical students about the potential impact of AI, to ensure radiology is perceived as a viable long-term career choice.},

	abstract = {Purpose Job demands can contribute to nurses’ turnover intention and this can have an impact on health services among the general population. It appears important to identify the work environment factors associated with turnover intention, as well as the psychological resources liable to act on this relationship. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), the purpose of this study (n=1179) is to investigate the relationship between two job demands (role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of basic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness) within these relationships. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses (Québec, Canada). Nurses completed an online questionnaire. To test the proposed moderating effect of satisfaction of the three psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness) in the relationship between job demands (i.e. role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, path analysis was conducted using Mplus v.8 (Muthén and Muthen, 2017). Two models, one for each demand, were tested. Findings As expected, role ambiguity and role conflict are positively related to turnover intention. Results reveal a significant interaction between role ambiguity and satisfaction of the need for autonomy in the prediction of turnover intention. The satisfaction of the need for competence and the satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for autonomy moderated the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Moreover, results revealed a significant interaction between role conflict and satisfaction of the need for competence in the prediction of turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications The results align with the theoretical propositions of several leading theories in occupational health which state that workers’ psychological functioning derives not only from the job characteristics of their work environment, but also from the psychological resources at their disposal. The study contributes to SDT. First, to date, this is the first study to investigate basic psychological need satisfaction as a moderator in the relationship between contextual factors and workers’ functioning. Second, the findings revealed the importance of assessing psychological needs separately, as each contributes in a specific way to workers’ work-related attitudes and adaptation to their professional environment. Practical implications Perceptions of autonomy and competence act as key psychological resources for nurses. Managerial support for autonomy (e.g. providing nurses with meaningful information regarding their work) and competence (e.g. providing nurses with frequent positive feedback regarding their work efforts) constitutes a series of key management practices that can foster perceptions of autonomy and competence. The findings show that two role stressors predict nurses’ turnover intention. As such, health care establishments are encouraged to focus on interventions that reduce uncertainties and conflicting situations from nurses (provide clear job descriptions and effective communication). Social implications By promoting a sense of effectiveness and feelings of self-endorsement at work, health care establishments can reduce nurses’ turnover intention and help prevent staffing shortages among this important work group. Originality/value Although past research shows that workers’ motivational profile can modulate the relationship between characteristics within the work environment and workers’ functioning, studying the quality of work motivation is not sufficient to completely understand the factors that can influence workers’ reactions to job demands. Need satisfaction is crucial to the development and maintenance of high quality motivation. Evaluating need satisfaction as a moderator in the stressor–strain relationship could offer a better understanding of the psychological experiences that can promote workers’ adaptation to their work environment. To date, no study has investigated the buffering role of psychological needs in the stressor–strain relationship.},

	abstract = {Background: Death by suicide is a preventable public health concern worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the probability of suicide death using baseline characteristics and simple medical facility visit history data using Cox regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs).
Method: This study included 819,951 subjects in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)–Cohort Sample Database from 2004 to 2013. The dataset was divided randomly into two independent training and validation groups. To improve the performance of predicting suicide death, we applied SVM and DNN to the same training set as the Cox regression model.
Results: Among the study population, 2546 people died by intentional self-harm during the follow-up time. Sex, age, type of insurance, household income, disability, and medical records of eight ICD-10 codes (including mental and behavioural disorders) were selected by a Cox regression model with backward stepwise elimination. The area of under the curve (AUC) of Cox regression (0.688), SVM (0.687), and DNN (0.683) were approximately the same. The group with top .5\% of predicted probability had hazard ratio of 26.21 compared to that with the lowest 10\% of predicted probability. Limitations: This study is limited by the lack of information on suicidal ideation and attempts, other potential covariates such as information of medication and subcategory ICD-10 codes. Moreover, predictors from the prior 12–24 months of the date of death could be expected to show better performances than predictors from up to 10 years ago.
Conclusions: We suggest a 10-year probability prediction model for suicide death using general characteristics and simple insurance data, which are annually conducted by the Korean government. Suicide death prevention might be enhanced by our prediction model.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed based on early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social communication. We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis.
Methods
Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were included for replication.
Results
High classification accuracy was achieved through several rs-fMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67\%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak accuracy 95.19\%). The class probability estimates, P(ASD{\textbar}fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning.
Conclusions
While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing.},

Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring.

We evaluated the performance of our model in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classifying ASD. Results indicated promising evidence for applying the machine learning algorithm based on the face scanning patterns to identify children with ASD, with a maximum classification accuracy of 88.51\%. Nevertheless, our study is still preliminary with some constraints that may apply in the clinical practice. Future research should shed light on further valuation of our method and contribute to the development of a multitask and multimodel approach to aid the process of early detection and diagnosis of ASD.

Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0–23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1–3.2). Using machine learning methods, we clustered children based on their medical conditions prior to ASD diagnosis and demonstrated ASD risk stratification.

Our goal is to determine whether a predictive model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can predict symptom severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We divided 118 ASD children into a mild/moderate autism group (n = 65) and a severe autism group (n = 53), based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). For each child, we obtained 29 SNPs of 9 ASD-related genes. To generate predictive models, we employed three machine-learning techniques: decision stumps (DSs), alternating decision trees (ADTrees), and FlexTrees. DS and FlexTree generated modestly better classifiers, with accuracy = 67\%, sensitivity = 0.88 and specificity = 0.42. The SNP rs878960 in GABRB3 was selected by all models, and was related associated with CARS assessment. Our results suggest that SNPs have the potential to offer accurate classification of ASD symptom severity.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide phenotypic range, often affecting personality and communication. Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of ASD have identified both gray- and white-matter volume changes. However, the cerebral cortex is a 2-D sheet with a highly folded and curved geometry, which VBM cannot directly measure. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) has the advantage of being able to measure cortical surface features, such as thickness. The goals of this study were twofold: to construct diagnostic models for ASD, based on regional thickness measurements extracted from SBM, and to compare these models to diagnostic models based on volumetric morphometry. Our study included 22 subjects with ASD (mean age 9.2±2.1 years) and 16 volunteer controls (mean age 10.0±1.9 years). Using SBM, we obtained regional cortical thicknesses for 66 brain structures for each subject. In addition, we obtained volumes for the same 66 structures for these subjects. To generate diagnostic models, we employed four machine-learning techniques: support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), functional trees (FTs), and logistic model trees (LMTs). We found that thickness-based diagnostic models were superior to those based on regional volumes. For thickness-based classification, LMT achieved the best classification performance, with accuracy=87\%, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.93, sensitivity=95\%, and specificity=75\%. For volume-based classification, LMT achieved the highest accuracy, with accuracy=74\%, AUC=0.77, sensitivity=77\%, and specificity=69\%. The thickness-based diagnostic model generated by LMT included 7 structures. Relative to controls, children with ASD had decreased cortical thickness in the left and right pars triangularis, left medial orbitofrontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left frontal pole, and increased cortical thickness in the left caudal anterior cingulate and left precuneus. Overall, thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification across a variety of classification methods.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disabling psychiatric disorder associated with consistent deficits in error processing, inhibition and regionally decreased grey matter volumes. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, interviews and questionnaires, which are to some degree subjective and would benefit from verification through biomarkers. Here, pattern recognition of multiple discriminative functional and structural brain patterns was applied to classify adolescents with ADHD and controls. Functional activation features in a Flanker/NoGo task probing error processing and inhibition along with structural magnetic resonance imaging data served to predict group membership using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM pattern recognition algorithm correctly classified 77.78 \% of the subjects with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.78 \% based on error processing. Predictive regions for controls were mainly detected in core areas for error processing and attention such as the medial and dorsolateral frontal areas reflecting deficient processing in ADHD (Hart et al., in Hum Brain Mapp 35:3083–3094, 2014), and overlapped with decreased activations in patients in conventional group comparisons. Regions more predictive for ADHD patients were identified in the posterior cingulate, temporal and occipital cortex. Interestingly despite pronounced univariate group differences in inhibition-related activation and grey matter volumes the corresponding classifiers failed or only yielded a poor discrimination. The present study corroborates the potential of task-related brain activation for classification shown in previous studies. It remains to be clarified whether error processing, which performed best here, also contributes to the discrimination of useful dimensions and subtypes, different psychiatric disorders, and prediction of treatment success across studies and sites.},

	abstract = {Screening and timely diagnosis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are currently an important challenge in studies of children’s ethology for increasing community mental health. Nevertheless, most studies on ADHD employed self-report questionnaires in which the reliability is questionable. A few of the studies for diagnosing the ADHD, which used the EEG signals, was not able to enhance the accuracy due to the use of stand-alone classifiers. Therefore, in this paper, we provided a novel analysis framework by combining a set of fuzzy inference system (FIS), called the mixture of expert fuzzy models (MEFM), which have high potential for diagnosing the ADHD children. Within this framework, we developed the MEFM utilizing features extracted from the continuous wavelet transform scalograms of EEG signals obtained from five different channels (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3 and C4). Then, we tuned the internal parameters of the MEFM employing the genetic algorithm. We, also, evaluated the MEFM classifier applying the tenfold cross-validation method and compared this classifier with stand-alone FIS and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results of MEFM classifier due to collective decision-making of the gating network exhibited a significant improvement (99.01\% accuracy) compare to stand-alone classifiers (98.07, 97.81\% and 88.25 for RBF-SVM, stand-alone fuzzy inference system (SFIS), linear-SVM). These results also illustrate that the MEFM classifier (due to distributed structure in comparison with the SFIS classifier) extremely reduced the number of fuzzy rules. Therefore, this new fuzzy combination (among the classifiers developed by several EEG channel) not only is a novelty in the fuzzy theory, but also considers being a better alternative for identifying and screening children with ADHD.},

	abstract = {Amid electronic health records, laboratory tests, and other technology, office-based patient and provider communication is still the heart of primary medical care. Patients typically present multiple complaints, requiring physicians to decide how to balance competing demands. How this time is allocated has implications for patient satisfaction, payments, and quality of care. We investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for automated annotation of medical topics in patient-provider dialog transcripts.We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to predict talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers, support vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential models that integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional random fields, hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent units).Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1) classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1 scores at the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential models had higher classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher precision at the visit level. Independent models had higher recall scores at the visit level compared with sequential models.Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out noisy information from talk-turns. Although the results are promising, more advanced prediction techniques and larger labeled datasets will likely be required to achieve prediction performance appropriate for real-world clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Objective: Mental illness is a leading cause of disease burden; however, many barriers prevent people from seeking mental health services. Technological innovations may improve our ability to reach underserved populations by overcoming many existing barriers. We evaluated a brief, automated risk assessment and intervention platform designed to increase the use of crisis resources provided to those online and in crisis. Method: Participants, users of the digital mental health app Koko, were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions upon accessing the app and were included in the study after their posts were identified by machine learning classifiers as signaling a current mental health crisis. Participants in the treatment condition received a brief Barrier Reduction Intervention (BRI) designed to increase the use of crisis service referrals provided on the app. Participants were followed up several hours later to assess the use of crisis services. Results: Only about one quarter of participants in a crisis (21.8\%) reported being “very likely” to use clinical referrals provided to them, with the most commonly endorsed barriers being they “just want to chat” or their “thoughts are too intense.” Among participants providing follow-up data (41.3\%), receipt of the BRI was associated with a 23\% increase in the use of crisis services. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a brief, automated BRI can be efficacious on digital platforms, even among individuals experiencing acute psychological distress. The potential to increase help seeking and service utilization with such procedures holds promise for those in need of psychiatric services.

	abstract = {Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe depression. However, biomarkers that accurately predict a response to ECT remain unidentified.To investigate whether certain factors identified by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to predict ECT response.In this nonrandomized prospective study, gray matter structure was assessed twice at approximately 6 weeks apart using 3-T MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Patients were recruited through the inpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, from March 11, 2010, to March 27, 2015. Two patient groups with acute major depressive disorder were included. One group received an ECT series in addition to antidepressants (n = 24); a comparison sample was treated solely with antidepressants (n = 23). Both groups were compared with a sample of healthy control participants (n = 21). Binary pattern classification was used to predict ECT response by structural MRI that was performed before treatment. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes.One participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3\% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100\% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = 8, y = 21, z = −18; Z score, 4.00; P \&lt; .001; peak voxel r = 0.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x = −28, y = −9, z = −18; Z score, 7.81; P \&lt; .001) that was missing in the medication-only sample.A relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT. In the future, neuroimaging techniques could prove to be promising tools for predicting the individual therapeutic effectiveness of ECT.},

The number and list of colors used, the area of each color painted, the blend of colors, etc., are common elements rated in the evaluation of art.

This paper delineates the development of a computer system that judges the main color in a drawing by applying the methods available in the field of digital image processing. Often, the main color is a different one from the color with the largest area painted, which is usually a background color. The system devises an algorithm, a kind of artificial intelligence function, to judge the main color as human experts do based on the characteristics, number of pixels, and number of clusters in a drawing. The proposed system is verified through case studies, by comparing the judgments by the computer with those by the human raters. It can contribute to the quantification and objectification of human decisions, as well as reducing the time and effort of human raters, and can therefore be a useful tool and an aid for human experts in making decisions in art therapy.},

Design Systematic review.
Data sources PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019.
Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes.
Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall).
Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38\%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62\%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 81\% to 91\%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56\%, 48\% to 64\%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41\%, 33\% to 49\%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39\%, 31\% to 47\%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73\%, 66\% to 79\%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74\%, 51\% to 88\%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40\%, 32\% to 47\%) and 79 (52\%, 44\% to 60\%) of the developed models, respectively.
Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

	abstract = {Introduction
Machine learning capability holds promise to inform disease models, the discovery and development of novel disease modifying therapeutics and prevention strategies in psychiatry. Herein, we provide an introduction on how machine learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) may instantiate such capabilities, as well as provide rationale for its application to psychiatry in both research and clinical ecosystems.
Methods
Databases PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from 1966 to June 2016 for keywords:Big Data, Machine Learning, Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Mental Health, Mental Disease, Psychiatry, Data Mining, RDoC, and Research Domain Criteria. Articles selected for review were those that were determined to be aligned with the objective of this particular paper.
Results
Results indicate that AI is a viable option to build useful predictors of outcome while offering objective and comparable accuracy metrics, a unique opportunity, particularly in mental health research. The approach has also consistently brought notable insight into disease models through processing the vast amount of already available multi-domain, semi-structured medical data. The opportunity for AI in psychiatry, in addition to disease-model refinement, is in characterizing those at risk, and it is likely also relevant to personalizing and discovering therapeutics.
Conclusions
Machine learning currently provides an opportunity to parse disease models in complex, multi-factorial disease states (e.g. mental disorders) and could possibly inform treatment selection with existing therapies and provide bases for domain-based therapeutic discovery.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955, the applications of AI have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in AI in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of AI in medical education. Objective: This study aims to review the current applications of AI in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing AI in medical education. Methods: Medline (Ovid), EBSCOhost Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were subsequently pooled together and analyzed quantitatively. Results: A total of 37 articles were identified. Three primary uses of AI in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students’ learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of AI are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for AI use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of AI implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of AI in medical education and technical challenges while developing AI applications. Conclusions: The primary use of AI in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students’ learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase AI adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an AI application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of AI. To better integrate AI into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce AI into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand AI algorithms and maximize its use.},

              Objectives 
              To explore the attitudes of United Kingdom (UK) medical students regarding artificial intelligence (AI), their understanding, and career intention towards radiology. We also examine the state of education relating to AI amongst this cohort. 
             
             
              Methods 
              UK medical students were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey consisting of Likert and dichotomous questions. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                Four hundred eighty-four responses were received from 19 UK medical schools. Eighty-eight percent of students believed that AI will play an important role in healthcare, and 49\% reported they were less likely to consider a career in radiology due to AI. Eighty-nine percent of students believed that teaching in AI would be beneficial for their careers, and 78\% agreed that students should receive training in AI as part of their medical degree. Only 45 students received any teaching on AI; none of the students received such teaching as part of their compulsory curriculum. Statistically, students that did receive teaching in AI were more likely to consider radiology ( 
                p 
                 = 0.01) and rated more positively to the questions relating to the perceived competence in the post-graduation use of AI ( 
                p 
                 = 0.01–0.04); despite this, a large proportion of students in the taught group reported a lack of confidence and understanding required for the critical use of healthcare AI tools. 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              UK medical students understand the importance of AI and are keen to engage. Medical school training on AI should be expanded and improved. Realistic use cases and limitations of AI must be presented to students so they will not feel discouraged from pursuing radiology.},

	abstract = {Background 
              The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine will generate numerous application possibilities to improve patient care, provide real-time data analytics, and enable continuous patient monitoring. Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice. 
             
             
              Objective 
              The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience. 
             
             
              Methods 
              A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments. 
             
             
              Results 
              This systematic review revealed that recent publications recommend the integration of AI training into medical and health informatics curricula. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring the current state of AI education in both medicine and health informatics. Since AI curricula have not been standardized and competencies have not been determined, a framework for specialized AI training in medical and health informatics education is proposed.},

The literature includes various intervention programs aiming to increase technology acceptance in this field. In this review, studies investigating the factors influencing the technology acceptance and recent interventions intending to enhance the technology usage in the field are covered. Generally, theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and unified theory of technology acceptance cover the most distinguished concepts and constructs to understand attitudes towards technological innovations. Influencing factors may differ for health care professionals and patients. While perceived benefits of technological innovations may be the most distinctive factor for health care professionals, ease of use is of big importance for patients. Perceived ease of use is affected by personal norms and perceived control beliefs. Suspicions of confidentiality and privacy are strong influencing factors for refusing technology usage for patients. Considering all these factors are necessary while designing intervention programs to enhance technology acceptance in health care. In the conclusion, the paper discusses whether the intervention programs originate from previously covered theoretical concepts and constructs.},

              Background 
              It is unlikely that applications of artificial intelligence (AI) will completely replace physicians. However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine. 
             
             
              Methods 
              To define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                A total of 568 medical students during the EFA phase and 329 medical students during the CFA phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9\% cumulative variance that resulted from the EFA. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. CFA indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model (

              Conclusions 
              The newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on AI technologies and applications. 
              Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with AI in medicine’ to their curricula by using MAIRS-MS. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities.},

              Objectives 
              Currently, hurdles to implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology are a much-debated topic but have not been investigated in the community at large. Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. 
             
             
              Methods 
              Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority ( 
                n 
                = 855, 82\%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader ( 
                n 
                = 829, 78\%) and work-flow optimization ( 
                n 
                = 802, 77\%). Ethical and legal issues ( 
                n 
                = 630, 62\%) and lack of knowledge ( 
                n 
                = 584, 57\%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority ( 
                n 
                = 819, 79\%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found ( 
                n 
                = 241, 23\%). 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation. 
             
             
              Key Points 
               
                • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty 
                . 
               
               
                • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles 
                . 
               
               
                • Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology

              Objectives 
              Radiologists’ perception is likely to influence the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice. We investigated knowledge and attitude towards AI by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond. 
             
             
              Methods 
              Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards AI was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards AI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male ( 
                n 
                = 670, 65\%), median age was 38 (24–74) years, 
                n

                n 
                = 471 (45\%) worked in an academic center. Basic AI-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.10–2.21, 
                p 
                = 0.01), while intermediate AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.20–0.80,

                p 
                = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards AI was observed in 48\% ( 
                n 
                = 501) and was associated with only having heard of AI, intermediate (adjusted OR 11.65, 95\% CI 4.25–31.92,

              Limited AI-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced AI-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards AI. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption. 
             
             
              Key Points 
               
                • Forty-eight percent of radiologists and residents have an open and proactive attitude towards artificial intelligence (AI), while 38\% fear of replacement by AI. 
               
               
                • Intermediate and advanced AI-specific knowledge levels may enhance adoption of AI in clinical practice, while rudimentary knowledge levels appear to be inhibitive. 
               
               
                • AI should be incorporated in radiology training curricula to help facilitate its clinical adoption.},

The aim of this study was to explore attitudes of 2020 medical students’ generation towards various aspects of eHealth technologies with the focus on AI using an exploratory sequential mixed-method analysis. Data from semi-structured interviews with 28 students from five medical faculties were used to construct an online survey send to about 80,000 medical students in Germany. Most students expressed positive attitudes towards digital applications in medicine. Students with a problem-based curriculum (PBC) in contrast to those with a science-based curriculum (SBC) and male undergraduate students think that AI solutions result in better diagnosis than those from physicians (p {\textless} 0.001). Male undergraduate students had the most positive view of AI (p {\textless} 0.002). Around 38\% of the students felt ill-prepared and could not answer AI-related questions because digitization in medicine and AI are not a formal part of the medical curriculum. AI rating regarding the usefulness in diagnostics differed significantly between groups. Higher emphasis in medical curriculum of digital solutions in patient care is postulated.},

Therefore, we need to raise attention and curiosity for AI and foster the willingness to engage with it among psychology students. This requires identifying approaches to integrate a general understanding of AI technology into formal psychological training and education. This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students’ attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula. In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of AI can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts.},

              There is increasing use of psychotherapy apps in mental health care. 
             
             
              Objective: 
              This mixed methods pilot study aimed to explore postgraduate clinical psychology students' familiarity and formal exposure to topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) during their studies. 
             
             
              Methods: 
              In April-June 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey using a convenience sample of 120 clinical psychology students enrolled in a two-year Masters' program at a Swiss University. 
             
             
              Results: 
              In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31\%). Among respondents, 73\% ( 
              n 
              = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97\% reported that they had heard of the term “machine learning.” Students estimated 0.52\% of their program would be spent on AI/ML education. Around half (46\%) reported that they intended to learn about AI/ML as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students “moderately agreed” (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues. 
             
             
              Conclusions: 
              This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how AI/ML-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy. The survey raises questions about how curricula could be enhanced to educate clinical psychology/psychotherapy trainees about the scope of AI/ML in mental healthcare.},

	abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious lifelong condition, its underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Recently, neuroimaging-based classifiers for ASD and typically developed (TD) individuals were developed to identify the abnormality of functional connections (FCs). Due to over-fitting and interferential effects of varying measurement conditions and demographic distributions, no classifiers have been strictly validated for independent cohorts. Here we overcome these difficulties by developing a novel machine-learning algorithm that identifies a small number of FCs that separates ASD versus TD. The classifier achieves high accuracy for a Japanese discovery cohort and demonstrates a remarkable degree of generalization for two independent validation cohorts in the USA and Japan. The developed ASD classifier does not distinguish individuals with major depressive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder from their controls but moderately distinguishes patients with schizophrenia from their controls. The results leave open the viable possibility of exploring neuroimaging-based dimensions quantifying the multiple-disorder spectrum.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.},

This model consists of two parts, a classifier and an intuitive representation of discriminative pattern of brain function between patients and normal controls. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of brain function at resting-state, is used here as a feature of classification. Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) is performed on the features of training samples and a linear classifier is generated. Our initial experimental results show a successful classification rate of 85\%, using leave-one-out cross validation. The classifier is also compared with linear support vector machine (SVM) and Batch Perceptron. Our classifier outperforms the alternatives significantly. Fisher brain, the optimal projective-direction vector in FDA, is used to represent the discriminative pattern. Some abnormal brain regions identified by Fisher brain, like prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are well consistent with that reported in neuroimaging studies on ADHD. Moreover, some less reported but highly discriminative regions are also identified. We conclude that the discriminative model has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD.},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is accompanied by abnormalities in brain functional connections. However, these findings are based on group comparisons, and, therefore, little is known about whether functional connections could be used in the diagnosis of an individual patient with SAD. Here, we explored the potential of the functional connectivity to be used for SAD diagnosis. Twenty patients with SAD and 20 healthy controls were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain was divided into 116 regions based on automated anatomical labeling atlas. The functional connectivity between each pair of regions was computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and used as classification feature. Multivariate pattern analysis was then used to classify patients from healthy controls. The pattern classifier was designed using linear support vector machine. Experimental results showed a correct classification rate of 82.5 \% (p {\textless} 0.001) with sensitivity of 85.0 \% and specificity of 80.0 \%, using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. It was found that the consensus connections used to distinguish SAD were largely located within or across the default mode network, visual network, sensory-motor network, affective network, and cerebellar regions. Specifically, the right orbitofrontal region exhibited the highest weight in classification. The current study demonstrated that functional connectivity had good diagnostic potential for SAD, thus providing evidence for the possible use of whole brain functional connectivity as a complementary tool in clinical diagnosis. In addition, this study confirmed previous work and described novel pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD.},

	abstract = {Early childhood anxiety disorders are common, impairing, and predictive of anxiety and mood disorders later in childhood. Epidemiological studies over the last decade find that the prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders in preschool children ranges from 0.3\% to 6.5\%. Yet, less than 15\% of young children with an impairing anxiety disorder receive a mental health evaluation or treatment. One possible reason for the low rate of care for anxious preschoolers is the lack of affordable, timely, reliable and valid tools for identifying young children with clinically significant anxiety. Diagnostic interviews assessing psychopathology in young children require intensive training, take hours to administer and code, and are not available for use outside of research settings. The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is a reliable and valid structured diagnostic parent-report interview for assessing psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, in 2 to 5 year old children. In this paper, we apply machine-learning tools to already collected PAPA data from two large community studies to identify sub-sets of PAPA items that could be developed into an efficient, reliable, and valid screening tool to assess a young child’s risk for an anxiety disorder. Using machine learning, we were able to decrease by an order of magnitude the number of items needed to identify a child who is at risk for an anxiety disorder with an accuracy of over 96\% for both generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Additionally, rather than considering GAD or SAD as discrete/binary entities, we present a continuous risk score representing the child’s risk of meeting criteria for GAD or SAD. Identification of a short question-set that assesses risk for an anxiety disorder could be a first step toward development and validation of a relatively short screening tool feasible for use in pediatric clinics and daycare/preschool settings.},

	abstract = {Background: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. Objective: We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a patient has based on the short textual description of patient’s history of present illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation note. Materials and methods: We clean and process the 1000 records made available through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). Results: Our CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best overall mean micro-F score of 63.144\% for 11 common mental conditions with statistically significant gains (p{\textless}0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904\% mean micro-F1 score. Both models’ improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular prediction for each instance. Conclusions: Although the history of present illness is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression is frequent in panic disorder (PD); yet, little is known about its influence on the neural substrates of PD. Difficulties in fear inhibition during safety signal processing have been reported as a pathophysiological feature of PD that is attenuated by depression. We investigated the impact of comorbid depression in PD with agoraphobia (AG) on the neural correlates of fear conditioning and the potential of machine learning to predict comorbidity status on the individual patient level based on neural characteristics.
Methods
Fifty-nine PD/AG patients including 26 (44\%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG+DEP) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Comorbidity status was predicted using a random undersampling tree ensemble in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework.
Results
PD/AG−DEP patients showed altered neural activation during safety signal processing, while +DEP patients exhibited generally decreased dorsolateral prefrontal and insular activation. Comorbidity status was correctly predicted in 79\% of patients (sensitivity: 73\%; specificity: 85\%) based on brain activation during fear conditioning (corrected for potential confounders: accuracy: 73\%; sensitivity: 77\%; specificity: 70\%).
Limitations
No primary depressed patients were available; only medication-free patients were included. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed (power considerations).
Conclusions
Neurofunctional activation during safety signal processing differed between patients with or without comorbid depression, a finding which may explain heterogeneous results across previous studies. These findings demonstrate the relevance of comorbidity when investigating neurofunctional substrates of anxiety disorders. Predicting individual comorbidity status may translate neurofunctional data into clinically relevant information which might aid in planning individualized treatment. The study was registered with the ISRCTN: ISRCTN80046034.},

	abstract = {Objective

Enhanced technology in computer and internet has driven scale and quality of data to be improved in various areas including healthcare sectors. Machine Learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in efficiently analyzing those big data, but a general misunderstanding of ML algorithms still exists in applying them (e.g., ML techniques can settle a problem of small sample size, or deep learning is the ML algorithm). This paper reviewed the research of diagnosing mental illness using ML algorithm and suggests how ML techniques can be employed and worked in practice.


Methods

Researches about mental illness diagnostic using ML techniques were carefully reviewed. Five traditional ML algorithms-Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)-frequently used for mental health area researches were systematically organized and summarized.


Results

Based on literature review, it turned out that Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) were frequently employed in mental health area, but many researchers did not clarify the reason for using their ML algorithm though every ML algorithm has its own advantages. In addition, there were several studies to apply ML algorithms without fully understanding the data characteristics.


Conclusion

Researchers using ML algorithms should be aware of the properties of their ML algorithms and the limitation of the results they obtained under restricted data conditions. This paper provides useful information of the properties and limitation of each ML algorithm in the practice of mental health.},

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining.
Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice
Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed.
Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform.
Conclusions: Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

	abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

This article addresses the nascent research field of blockchain for a circular economy and examines current developments, from both research and practice. By developing and conducting a research-practice gap analysis using a systematic literature review, this article identifies patterns of interests and opportunities for research and practice and uncovers mutual blind spots that need to be addressed in either sphere. A systematic literature review and qualitative analysis covering 57 diverse documents (journal articles, contents linked from twitter, and google results) revealed three key findings: 1) a clear terminology of blockchain types, their technical properties and benefits are lacking in research, 2) trust and verification are major potential benefits but a challenge to create, and 3) a closer examination of possible benefits and challenges of blockchain technologies for the circular economy with its links to sustainable development is crucial.},

            Artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support have been developed for clinical settings such as radiology, but little work evaluates the potential impact of such systems. In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.},

	abstract = {Background: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.},

Along the way, we describe the (big) problem that pre-registration can solve (i.e., false positives caused by p-hacking), while also offering viable solutions to the problems that pre-registration cannot solve (e.g., hidden confounds or fraud). Pre-registration does not guarantee that every published ﬁnding will be true, but without it you can safely bet that many more will be false. It is time for our ﬁeld to embrace pre-registration, while taking steps to ensure that it is done right.},

Whereas previous studies have focused on IER as a methodological nuisance, the current studies examined IER as a substantive variable. Specifically, we hypothesized that IER is a reflection of enduring individual differences. In Study 1, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency over the course of 13 months; in Studies 2 and 3, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency across multiple research situations; in Study 4, we found that acquaintance-reported conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability were each negatively related to IER; and in Study 5, we found that IER was related to college grade point average and class absences. Together, these 5 studies suggest that IER is in part a manifestation of enduring individual differences.},

	doi = {10.2196/24680},
	abstract = {Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical industry promises many benefits, so AI has been introduced to medical practice primarily in developed countries. In Japan, the government is preparing for the rollout of AI in the medical industry. This rollout depends on doctors and the public accepting the technology. Therefore it is necessary to consider acceptance among doctors and among the public. However, little is known about the acceptance of AI in medicine in Japan.
Objective: This study aimed to obtain detailed data on the acceptance of AI in medicine by comparing the acceptance among Japanese doctors with that among the Japanese public.
Methods: We conducted an online survey, and the responses of doctors and members of the public were compared. AI in medicine was defined as the use of AI to determine diagnosis and treatment without requiring a doctor. A questionnaire was prepared referred to as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a model of behavior toward new technologies. It comprises 20 items, and each item was rated on a five-point scale. Using this questionnaire, we conducted an online survey in 2018 among 399 doctors and 600 members of the public. The sample-wide responses were analyzed, and then the responses of the doctors were compared with those of the public using t tests.
Results: Regarding the sample-wide responses (N=999), 653 (65.4\%) of the respondents believed, in the future, AI in medicine would be necessary, whereas only 447 (44.7\%) expressed an intention to use AI-driven medicine. Additionally, 730 (73.1\%) believed that regulatory legislation was necessary, and 734 (73.5\%) were concerned about where accountability lies. Regarding the comparison between doctors and the public, doctors (mean 3.43, SD 1.00) were more likely than members of the public (mean 3.23, SD 0.92) to express intention to use AI-driven medicine (P\&lt;.001), suggesting that optimism about AI in medicine is greater among doctors compared to the public.
Conclusions: Many of the respondents were optimistic about the role of AI in medicine. However, when asked whether they would like to use AI-driven medicine, they tended to give a negative response. This trend suggests that concerns about the lack of regulation and about accountability hindered acceptance. Additionally, the results revealed that doctors were more enthusiastic than members of the public regarding AI-driven medicine. For the successful implementation of AI in medicine, it would be necessary to inform the public and doctors about the relevant laws and to take measures to remove their concerns about them.},

	abstract = {Background: An artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted contouring system benefits radiation oncologists by saving time and improving treatment accuracy. Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of AI projects.
Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists’ acceptance of AI contouring technology in a Chinese context.
Methods: A model of AI-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model’s path effects, significance, and fitness.
Results: The overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy (β=.155; P=.01), social influence (β=.365; P\&lt;.001), and facilitating conditions (β=.459; P\&lt;.001). Effort expectancy (β=.055; P=.45), perceived risk (β=−.048; P=.35), and resistance bias (β=−.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention.
Conclusions: The physicians’ overall perceptions of an AI-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh UTAUT model applied to AI technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context.},

Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals’ characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model. The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China. The empirical examination demonstrates a high predictive power of this proposed model in explaining AIMDSS adoption.

	abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.},

In terms of prediction and detection, modern streams of abundant data mean that data-driven AI methods can be employed to develop prediction/detection models for mental health conditions. In particular, an individual’s ‘digital exhaust’, the data gathered from their numerous personal digital device and social media interactions, can be mined for behavioural or mental health insights.

	abstract = {The nature of mental illness remains a conundrum. Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.},

	abstract = {Background Students with complex health care services process face constant challenges with regard to health education. The mobile devices are an important tool that can install various applications for using information such as clinical guidelines, drug resources, clinical calculations, and the latest scientiﬁc evidence without any time and place limitations. And this happens only when students accept and use it.
Objective The purpose of this article is to identify the factors inﬂuencing students in their intention to use mobile health (mHealth) by using Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model.
Methods A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from nearly 302 Lorestan University of medical science students including nutrition and public health, paramedicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, dentistry, and medical schools. The data were processed using LISREL (Scientiﬁc Software International, Inc., Lincolnwood, Illinois) and SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) softwares and the statistical analysis technique was based on structural equation modeling (SEM).
Result A total of 300 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study. The results showed that mediator of age did not affect the predictors of intention to use mHealth, and the level of education and gender directly affected the intention to use. In addition, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, and behavioral intention directly and indirectly have effect on use, whereas the result revealed no signiﬁcant relationship between two important processes of performance expectancy and social inﬂuence with students’ behavioral intention to use the mHealth.
Conclusions The present study provides valuable information on mobile health acceptance factors for widespread use of this device among students of universities of medical sciences as a base infrastructure for a variety of information about health services and learning. Review and comparison of results with other studies showed that mHealth acceptance factors were different from other end users (elderly, patients, and health professionals).},

	abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

	abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems (IS) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the IS literature on UTAUT from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of UTAUT and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined UTAUT and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to UTAUT, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of UTAUT using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing UTAUT extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future UTAUT-related research using the proposed framework.},

At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83\% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90\% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{\textless}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{\textless}.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance–based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31\% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Previous research indicates that motivational interviewing (MI) skills decline over time among participants in training workshops when post-workshop feedback and coaching are not provided. This study explored moderators of skill retention among trainees learning MI mainly for substance use disorder treatment in real-world treatment settings, including workshop enhancements and type and dose of post-workshop feedback and coaching. Methods A meta-analysis of training studies was conducted with studies that reported MI skills using observational measures and that included trainees from real-world agency settings. Standardized change scores were calculated to indicate the magnitude of pre–post training change in MI skills; standardized change scores from post-training to 3 and 6+ months follow-up were calculated to indicate the sustainability of training gains over time. Effect sizes were aggregated using random effects models. Results Twenty-one papers that reported the effects of MI training on agency staff were included in this review. Across studies, training yielded gains in MI skills (d = 0.76). Studies that did not include feedback and/or coaching reported eroding skills over a 6-month follow-up (d = −0.30), whereas post-workshop feedback/coaching sustained skills (d = 0.03). Effects of post-workshop feedback/coaching were moderated by frequency, duration and length of training. Moreover, studies reporting low levels of attrition from training protocols showed small increases in skills over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.12), whereas studies with high attrition showed skill erosion (d = −0.29). Conclusions On average, three to four feedback/coaching sessions over a 6-month period sustain skills among trainees for motivational interviewing, mainly for substance use disorder treatment. However, high rates of attrition from feedback/coaching contributes to post-workshop skill erosion.},

The errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the study as the final number of meta-analysable studies are the same as originally reported.] A meta-analysis examining temporal changes (time trends) in the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment for unipolar depression was conducted. A comprehensive search of psychotherapy trials yielded 70 eligible studies from 1977 to 2014. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified as Hedge’s g based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Rates of remission were also registered. The publication year of each study was examined as a linear metaregression predictor of ES, and as part of a 2-way interaction with other moderators (Year × Moderator). The average ES of the BDI was 1.58 (95\% CI [1.43, 1.74]), and 1.69 for the HRSD (95\% CI [1.48, 1.89]). Subgroup analyses revealed that women profited more from therapy than did men (p {\textless} .05). Experienced psychologists (g = 1.55) achieved better results (p {\textless} .01) than less experienced student therapists (g = 0.98). The metaregressions examining the temporal trends indicated that the effects of CBT have declined linearly and steadily since its introduction, as measured by patients’ self-reports (the BDI, p {\textless} .001), clinicians’ ratings (the HRSD, p {\textless} .01) and rates of remission (p {\textless} .01). Subgroup analyses confirmed that the declining trend was present in both within-group (pre/post) designs (p {\textless} .01) and controlled trial designs (p = .02). Thus, modern CBT clinical trials seemingly provided less relief from depressive symptoms as compared with the seminal trials. Potential causes and possible implications for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background: Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers.
Objective: The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system.
Methods: To accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature.
Results: The environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI.
Conclusions: Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

Background
In 2000, four community hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic Health System embarked on an electronic medical record (EMR) project to create an integrated information management environment and improve clinical decision making.
Methods
Executives and individuals from many departments and disciplines were organized into a project structure to launch the project, make decisions, and accomplish change management, which addressed communication, work-flow redesign, training, and support during transition to the new technology-enabled process.
Project
In 1999, a small group of regional information technology (IT) leaders for four community hospitals operated by the Cleveland Clinic Health System in the East Region developed a project for the implementation of computerized physician order management (CPOM).
Results
Huron Hospital, the first hospital selected for implementation, met its goals for a successful transition. After two pilots, implementation occurred on schedule and with a noticeable lack of major issues, both during rollout and thereafter. In addition, physician direct entry of orders reached the first-year goal of 40\% physician entry in the first month and 75\% within a year.
Conclusions
Ensuring success required a systematic approach to the foundations of change management—work-flow redesign, communication, training, and support—during the transition.},

	abstract = {Background: Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers.
Objective: The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system.
Methods: To accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature.
Results: The environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI.
Conclusions: Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

	abstract = {Background: Many promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level. Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs—video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing—using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

	abstract = {Background. Digital technologies increasingly shape today’s world of work. This not only affects sectors such as knowledge work and the automotive industry, but also the care sector. On the one hand, many nurses today use technologies supporting some selected and rather peripheral nursing tasks (e.g., electronic documentation). However, on the other hand, more comprehensive and additionally proximal care-related task devices (e.g., diagnostics via telecare) seem to be used less often. From a psychological perspective, attitudes towards technology are an important antecedent of user behaviour. Therefore, in two studies we aimed to examine if nurses’ attitudes towards four digital technology fields (i.e., electronic documentation ED, ambient assisted living AAL, telecare application and robotics) are differing in relation to the type of task substitution, how technology appraisal and knowledge shape these attitudes, and how attitudes predict user behaviour. Method. We conducted two cross-sectional survey studies with German nurses (Study 1: N = 148, Study 2: N = 252) with well-established scales (i.e., general and work-related positive and negative attitudes towards technologies, ease of use, usability, knowledge, and technology use). Results. We found that it is important to consider positive and negative attitudes towards technology distinctively as intercorrelations were only moderately negative. As expected, we found in both studies that nurses reported stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards technologies assumed to be substituting more specific and peripheral (e.g., ED) than comprehensive and proximal care tasks (e.g., robotics). Moreover, we found that two types of technology appraisal (ease of use and usability) both positively correlated with positive attitudes towards all four technology fields, whereas patterns were more inconsistent and additionally influenced by technology knowledge when predicting negative attitudes. Although inconsistently across both studies and the considered technologies, in general, technology users reported more positive and less negative attitudes than non-users. Conclusion. If technology developers and nursing facility managers want to help nurses successfully adopting new technologies in their work routines, nurses’ technology appraisal and technology attitudes have to be considered already in the pre-development phase. Our study results show that nurses report different attitudes towards the four digital technology fields considered here in relation to the levels and types of task-substitution. More specifically, if core carerelated work-tasks (e.g., direct care) are not substituted, nurses report stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards the supporting technologies and higher user behaviour.},

	abstract = {The literature illustrates that technology will widen health disparity if its use is restricted to patients who are already motivated and demonstrate good self-management behaviours. Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results confirmed that all four UTAUT constructs; performance expectancy (“the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance”), effort expectancy (“the degree of ease associated with the use of the system”, social influence (“the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system”) and facilitating conditions (“the degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system”), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships among determinant (ease of use), extrinsic (usefulness) and intrinsic motivations (enjoyment), attachment and usage intention regarding seniors’ use of mobile devices for tourism. In addition, this study examines the moderating role of knowledge in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The researchers collected data via online surveys to reach the target population of this study, 55 years and older adults who had used mobile devices for tourism. The researchers used the partial least squares approach for this study. Findings The results reveal that ease of use has significant effects on extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The motivations of usefulness and enjoyment significantly affect attachment, which, in turn, influences usage intention. The relationships between ease of use and usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment and enjoyment and attachment were stronger for the high-knowledge group than for the low-knowledge group. The relationship between usefulness and attachment was stronger for the low-knowledge group than for the high-knowledge group. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study provide compelling implications for academics and practitioners in the senior tourism field. Originality/value The compelling insight of this study is the development of a research model that combines an emergent construct of attachment as a mediator and knowledge of technology as a moderator.},

Besides, there is also a growing concern on the ethical aspect of e-money from an Islamic perspective, that is riba or usury. Previous studies have examined customers' behavioral intention to use e-money by implementing Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). However, none of them considering customers' knowledge about riba that might become ethical aspect detaining them to use e-money as the mode of payment. The objective of this research is to examine the moderating effect of knowledge about riba on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) variabels, such as perceived usefuleness, perceived ease of use and intention to use e-money. Data of this research are collected by distributing online questionnaires. By convenience sampling method, there are total 253 respondents. From the statistical computation, it is found that intention to use e-money is significantly affected by respondents' perception of e-money usefulness and ease of use. Interestingly, it is also found that customers' intention to use e-money are moderated by their knowledge about riba. Therefore, as managerial implication, it is suggested for e-money providers to build a Muslim-friendly system that is free from riba. Finally, this research also suggests future research agenda to consider subjective norm and religiosity variabels in a single model.},

	abstract = {Background
mHealth (mobile health) services are becoming an increasingly important form of information and communication technology (ICT) enabled delivery for healthcare, especially in low-resource environments such as developing countries like Bangladesh. Despite widespread adoption of mobile phones and the acknowledged potential of using them to improve healthcare services, the adoption and acceptance of this technology among the elderly is significantly low. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study of the elderly’s intention to adopt mHealth services.
Objective
The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and then empirically test it for determining the key factors influencing elderly users’ intention to adopt and use the mHealth services.
Methods
A face-to-face structured questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from nearly 300 participants of age 60 years and above from the capital city of Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, a statistical analysis technique based upon Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).
Results
The study determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, and resistance to change (p{\textless}0.05) had a significant impact on the users’ behavioral intention to adopt mHealth services. The study, however, revealed no significant relation between the facilitating condition and the users’ behavioral intention to use the mHealth services (p{\textgreater}0.05).
Conclusions
This study confirms the applicability of UTAUT model in the context of mHealth services among the elderly in developing countries like Bangladesh. It provides valuable information for mHealth service providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges and the issues and also provides practical guidance for the successful implementation of mHealth services. Additionally the empirical findings identify implications related to the design and development of mHealth services that influence potential users. Furthermore, due to a generic approach, the findings of this study could be easily modified to assist other developing countries in the planning and up-take of mHealth services.},

	abstract = {Background
Although telehealth offers an improved approach to providing healthcare services, its adoption by end users remains slow. With an older population as the main target, these traditionally conservative users pose a big challenge to the successful implementation of innovative telehealth services.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the factors affecting older users’ acceptance of Home Telehealth Services (HTS).
Methods
A survey instrument was administered to 400 participants aged 50 years and above from both rural and urban environments in Slovenia. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effect of seven hypothesized predicting factors. HTS were introduced as a bundle of functionalities, representing future services that currently do not exist. This enabled users’ perceptions to be measured on the conceptual level, rather than attitudes to a specific technical solution.
Results
Six relevant predictors were confirmed in older users’ HTS acceptance behavior, with Performance Expectancy (r=0.30), Effort Expectancy (r=0.49), Facilitating Conditions (r=0.12), and Perceived Security (r=0.16) having a direct impact on behavioral intention to use HTS. In addition, Computer Anxiety is positioned as an antecedent of Effort Expectancy with a strong negative influence (r=−0.61), and Doctor’s Opinion influence showed a strong impact on Performance Expectancy (r=0.31). The results also indicate Social Influence as an irrelevant predictor of acceptance behavior. The model of six predictors yielded 77\% of the total variance explained in the final measured Behavioral Intention to Use HTS by older adults.
Conclusion
The level at which HTS are perceived as easy to use and manage is the leading acceptance predictor in older users’ HTS acceptance. Together with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Security, these three factors represent the key influence on older people’s HTS acceptance behavior. When promoting HTS, interventions should focus to portray it as secure. Marketing interventions should focus also on promoting HTS among health professionals, using them as social agents to frame the services as useful and beneficial. The important role of computer anxiety may result in a need to use different equipment such as a tablet computer to access HTS. Finally, this paper introduces important methodological guidelines for measuring perceptions on a conceptual level of future services that currently do not exist.},

	abstract = {A foundational question for the discipline of psychiatry is the nature of psychiatric disorders. What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two “flavors” of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness.},

	abstract = {Across the landscape of mental health research and diagnosis, there is a diverse range of questionnaires and interviews available for use by clinicians and researchers to determine patient treatment plans or investigate internal and external etiologies. Although individually, these tools have each been assessed for their validity and reliability, there is little research examining the consistency between them in terms of what symptoms they assess, and how they assess those symptoms. Here, we provide an analysis of 126 different questionnaires and interviews commonly used to diagnose and screen for 10 different disorder types including depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), addiction, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as comparator questionnaires and interviews that offer an all-in-one cross-disorder assessment of mental health. We demonstrate substantial inconsistency in the inclusion and emphasis of symptoms assessed within disorders as well as considerable symptom overlap across disorder-specific tools. Within the same disorder, similarity scores across assessment tools ranged from 29\% for assessment of bipolar disorder to a maximum of 58\% for OCD. Furthermore, when looking across disorders, 60\% of symptoms were assessed in at least half of all disorders illustrating the extensive overlap in symptom profiles between disorder-specific assessment tools. Biases in assessment toward emotional, cognitive, physical or behavioral symptoms were also observed, further adding to the heterogeneity across assessments. Analysis of other characteristics such as the time period over which symptoms were assessed, as well as whether there was a focus toward frequency, severity or duration of symptoms also varied substantially across assessment tools. The consequence of this inconsistent and heterogeneous assessment landscape is that it hinders clinical diagnosis and treatment and frustrates understanding of the social, environmental, and biological factors that contribute to mental health symptoms and disorders. Altogether, it underscores the need for standardized assessment tools that are more disorder agnostic and span the full spectrum of mental health symptoms to aid the understanding of underlying etiologies and the discovery of new treatments for psychiatric dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Objective: Thus far, most applications in precision mental health have not been evaluated prospectively. This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. Method: Therapist–patient dyads (N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. Results: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback—outcome and the not on track—outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.

This paper reviews specific neuroimaging abnormalities that, on the basis of early studies, may discriminate between MDD patients who do or do not respond to current therapeutic modalities, such as antidepressants, cognitive behavioral therapy, or novel therapies. Differences in gray matter volume, white matter coherence, brain activity via structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, and concentrations of specific brain metabolites (as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy), are potential biomarkers discussed in this review. Given the heterogeneity of MDD, larger, multisite studies with increased statistical power will be needed to identify more precise imaging biomarkers of treatment response in MDD.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry, partly because there is a weak correspondence between diagnostic labels and their neurobiological substrates. Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes (‘biotypes’) defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82–93\%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies.},

Although digital data can be acquired from patients in many ways, the integration of this digital data with patient treatment is less than ideal. For example, merely recording activity of a patient and suggesting an activity according to a predetermined treatment plan may not provide the best treatment for the patient. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Although digital diagnosis with machine learning has been proposed, the integration of digital diagnostics with patient treatments can be less than ideal. For example, classifiers used to diagnose patients may be less than ideally suited to most effectively align treatments with diagnoses or monitor treatments. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Prior methods and apparatus for diagnosing and treating cognitive function of people such as people with a developmental disorder can be less than ideal in at least some respects. Unfortunately, a less than ideal amount of time, energy and money can be required to obtain a diagnosis and treatment, and to determine whether a subject is at risk for decreased cognitive function such as, dementia, Alzheimer's or a developmental disorder. Examples of cognitive and developmental disorders less than ideally treated by the prior approaches include autism, autistic spectrum, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder and speech and learning disability, for example. Examples of mood and mental illness disorders less than ideally treated by the prior approaches include depression, anxiety, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder, and substance disorders such as substance abuse and eating disorders. The prior approaches to diagnosis and treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases can be less than ideal in many instances, and examples of such neurodegenerative diseases include age related cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), for example. The healthcare system is under increasing pressure to deliver care at lower costs, and prior methods and apparatus for clinically diagnosing or identifying a subject as at risk of a developmental disorder can result in greater expense and burden on the health care system than would be ideal. Further, at least some subjects are not treated as soon as ideally would occur, such that the burden on the healthcare system is increased with the additional care required for these subjects. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The identification and treatment of cognitive disorders in subjects can present a daunting technical problem in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Many prior methods for identifying and treating such disorders are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring a subject to answer a large number of questions or undergo extensive observation under the administration of qualified clinicians, who may be limited in number and availability depending on the subject's geographical location. In addition, many prior methods for identifying and treating behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders have less than ideal accuracy and consistency, as subjects to be evaluated using such methods often present a vast range of variation that can be difficult to capture and classify. A technical solution to such a technical problem would be desirable, wherein the technical solution can improve both the accuracy and efficiency for diagnosis and treatment. Ideally, such a technical solution would reduce the required time and resources for administering a method for identifying and treating attributes of cognitive function, such as behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders, and improve the accuracy and consistency of the identification outcomes of subjects. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Furthermore, although prior lengthy tests with questions can be administered to caretakers such as parents in order to diagnose or identify a subject as at risk for a developmental disorder, such tests can be quite long and burdensome. For example at least some of these tests have over one hundred questions, and more than one such lengthy test may be administered further increasing the burden on health care providers and caretakers. Additional data may be required such as clinical observation of the subject, and clinical visits may further increase the amount of time and burden on the healthcare system. Consequently, the time between a subject being identified as needing to be evaluated and being clinically identified as at risk or diagnosed with a developmental delay can be several months, and in some instances over a year. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Also, it would be helpful if diagnostic methods and treatments could be applied to subjects to advance cognitive function for subjects with advanced, normal and decreased cognitive function. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In light of the above, improved digital therapeutics for patients are needed. Ideally, such digital therapeutics would provide a customized treatment plan for a patient, receive updated diagnostic data in response to the customized treatment plan to determine progress, and update the treatment plan accordingly. There is also a need for improved methods and apparatus of diagnosing, treating and identifying subjects who are at risk. Ideally such methods and apparatus would monitor patients with fewer questions, decreased amounts of time, and provide clinically acceptable sensitivity and specificity in a clinical or nonclinical environment, which can be used to monitor and adapt treatment efficacy. Ideally, such methods and apparatus can also be used to determine the developmental progress of a subject, and offer treatment to advance developmental progress. {\textbar}   {\textbar} SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION {\textbar}   {\textbar} The digital personalized medicine systems and methods described herein provide digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics to patients. The digital personalized medicine system uses digital data to assess or diagnose symptoms of a patient in ways that inform personalized or more appropriate therapeutic interventions and improved diagnoses. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In one aspect, the digital personalized medicine system comprises digital devices with processors and associated software configured to: use data to assess and diagnose a patient; capture interaction and feedback data that identify relative levels of efficacy, compliance and response resulting from the therapeutic interventions; and perform data analysis, including at least one of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical models to assess user data and user profiles to further personalize, improve or assess efficacy of the therapeutic interventions. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In some instances, the system is configured to use digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics. Digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics can comprise a system or methods for digitally collecting information and processing and analyzing the provided data to improve the medical, psychological, or physiological state of an individual. A digital therapeutic system can apply software based learning to analyze user data, monitor and improve the diagnoses and therapeutic interventions provided by the system. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Digital diagnostics data in the system can comprise data and meta-data collected from the patient, or a caregiver, or a party that is independent of the individual being assessed. In some instances the collected data can comprise monitoring behaviors, observations, judgements, or assessments may be made by a party other than the individual. In further instances the assessment can comprise an adult performing an assessment or provide data for an assessment of a child or juvenile. The data and meta-data can be either actively or passively in digital format via one or more digital devices such as mobile phones, video capture, audio capture, activity monitors, or wearable digital monitors. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The digital diagnostic uses the data collected by the system about the patient, which may include complimentary diagnostic data captured outside the digital diagnostic, with analysis from tools such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to assess or diagnose the patient's condition. The digital diagnostic can also provide assessment of a patient's change in state or performance, directly or indirectly via data and meta-data that can be analyzed by tools such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to provide feedback into the system to improve or refine the diagnoses and potential therapeutic interventions. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Data assessment and machine learning from the digital diagnostic and corresponding responses, or lack thereof, from the therapeutic interventions can lead to the identification of novel diagnoses for patients and novel therapeutic regimens for both patents and caregivers. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Types of data collected and utilized by the system can include patient and caregiver video, audio, responses to questions or activities, and active or passive data streams from user interaction with activities, games or software features of the system, for example. Such data can also include meta-data from patient or caregiver interaction with the system, for example, when performing recommended activities. Specific meta-data examples include data from a user's interaction with the system's device or mobile app that captures aspects of the user's behaviors, profile, activities, interactions with the software system, interactions with games, frequency of use, session time, options or features selected, and content and activity preferences. Data may also include data and meta-data from various third party devices such as activity monitors, games or interactive content. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Digital therapeutics can comprise instructions, feedback, activities or interactions provided to the patient or caregiver by the system. Examples include suggested behaviors, activities, games or interactive sessions with system software and/or third party devices. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In further aspects, the digital therapeutics methods and apparatus disclosed herein can diagnose and treat a subject as at risk of having one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders among a plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders in a clinical or nonclinical setting, with fewer questions, in a decreased amounts of time, and with clinically acceptable sensitivity and specificity in a clinical environment, and provide treatment recommendations. This can be helpful when a subject initiates treatment based on an incorrect diagnosis, for example. A processor can be configured with instructions to identify a most predictive next question or most instructive next symptom or observation, such that a person can be diagnosed or identified as at risk and treated with fewer questions or observations. Identifying the most predictive next question or most instructive next symptom or observation in response to a plurality of answers has the advantage of increasing the sensitivity and the specificity and providing treatment with fewer questions. In some instances, an additional processor can be provided to predict or collect information on the next more relevant symptom. The methods and apparatus disclosed herein can be configured to evaluate and treat a subject for a plurality of related disorders using a single test, and diagnose or determine the subject as at risk of one or more of the plurality of disorders using the single test. Decreasing the number of questions presented or symptoms or measurements used can be particularly helpful where a subject presents with a plurality of possible disorders of which can be treated. Evaluating the subject for the plurality of possible disorders using just a single test can greatly reduce the length and cost of the evaluation procedure and improve treatment. The methods and apparatus disclosed herein can diagnose and treat subject at risk for having a single disorder among a plurality of possible disorders that may have overlapping symptoms. {\textbar}   {\textbar} While the most predictive next question, most instructive next symptom or observation used for the digital therapeutic treatment can be determined in many ways, in many instances the most predictive next question, symptom or observation is determined in response to a plurality of answers to preceding questions or observation that may comprise prior most predictive next question, symptom or observation to evaluate the treatment and provide a closed loop assessment of the subject. The most predictive next question, symptom or observation can be determined statistically, and a set of possible most predictive next questions, symptoms or observations can be evaluated to determine the most predictive next question, symptom or observation. In many instances, observations or answers to each of the possible most predictive next questions are related to the relevance of the question or observation, and the relevance of the question or observation can be determined in response to the combined feature importance of each possible answer to a question or observation. Once a treatment has been initiated, the questions, symptoms or can be repeated or different questions, symptoms or observations used to more accurately monitor progress and suggest changes to the digital treatment. The relevance of a next question, symptom or observation can also depend on the likely variance of the ultimate assessment among different answer choices of the question or potential options for an observation. For example, a question for which the answer choices might have a significant impact on the ultimate assessment down the line can be deemed more relevant than a question for which the answer choices might only help to discern differences in severity for one particular condition, or are otherwise less consequential. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Aspects of the present disclosure provide digital therapeutic systems to treat a subject with a personal therapeutic treatment plan.

Digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics can comprise a system or methods comprising collecting digital information and processing and analyzing the provided data to improve the medical, psychological, or physiological state of an individual. A digital therapeutic system can apply software based learning to analyze user data, monitor and improve the diagnoses and therapeutic interventions provided by the system. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Digital diagnostics in the system can comprise of data and meta-data collected from the patient, or a caregiver, or a party that is independent of the individual being assessed. In some instances the collected data can comprise monitoring behaviors, observations, judgements, or assessments may be made by a party other than the individual. In further instances the assessment can comprise an adult performing an assessment or provide data for an assessment of a child or juvenile. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Data sources can comprise either active or passive sources, in digital format via one or more digital devices such as mobile phones, video capture, audio capture, activity monitors, or wearable digital monitors. Examples of active data collection comprise devices, systems or methods for tracking eye movements, recording body or appendage movement, monitoring sleep patterns, recording speech patterns. In some instances, the active sources can include audio feed data source such as speech patterns, lexical/syntactic patterns (for example, size of vocabulary, correct/incorrect use of pronouns, correct/incorrect inflection and conjugation, use of grammatical structures such as active/passive voice etc., and sentence flow), higher order linguistic patterns (for example, coherence, comprehension, conversational engagement, and curiosity), touch-screen data source (for example, fine-motor function, dexterity, precision and frequency of pointing, precision and frequency of swipe movement, and focus/attention span), and video recording of subject's face during activity (for example, quality/quantity of eye fixations vs saccades, heat map of eye focus on the screen, focus/attention span, variability of facial expression, and quality of response to emotional stimuli). Passive data collection can comprise devices, systems, or methods for collecting data from the user using recording or measurements derived from mobile applications, toys with embed sensors or recording units. In some instances, the passive source can include sensors embedded in smart toys (for example, fine motor function, gross motor function, focus/attention span and problem solving skills) and wearable devices (for example, level of activity, quantity/quality of rest). {\textbar}   {\textbar} The data used in the diagnosis and treatment can come from a plurality of sources, and may comprise a combination of passive and active data collection gathered from one device such as a mobile device with which the user interacts, or other sources such as microbiome sampling and genetic sampling of the subject. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The methods and apparatus disclose herein are well suited for the diagnosis and digital therapeutic treatment of cognitive and developmental disorders, mood and mental illness, and neurodegenerative diseases. Examples of cognitive and developmental disorders include speech and learning disorders, intelligence quotient (“IQ”), non-verbal IQ and verbal IQ and other disorders as described herein. Examples of mood and mental illness disorders, which can effect children and adults, include behavioral disorders, mood disorders, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), obsessive compulsive disorder (“OCD”), schizophrenia, and substance such as eating disorders and substance abuse. Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include age related cognitive decline, cognitive impairment progressing to Alzheimer's and senility, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). The methods and apparatus disclosed herein are capable of digitally diagnosing and treating children and continuing treatment until the subject becomes an adult, and can provide lifetime treatment based on personalized profiles. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The digital diagnosis and treatment as described herein is well suited for behavioral intervention coupled with biological or chemical therapeutic treatment. By gathering user interaction data as described herein, feedback effective therapies can be provided for combinations of behavioral intervention data pharmaceutical and biological treatments. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The mobile devices as describe herein may comprise sensors to collect data of the subject that can be used as part of the feedback loop so as to improve outcomes and decrease reliance on user input. The mobile device may comprise a passive or active sensors as described herein to collect data of the subject subsequent to treatment. The same mobile device or a second mobile device, such as an iPad™ or iPhone™ or similar device, may comprise a software application that interacts with the user to tell the user what to do in improve treatment on a regular basis, e.g. day by day, hour by hour, etc. The user mobile device can be configured to send notifications to the user in response to treatment progress. The mobile device may comprise a drug delivery device configured to monitor deliver amounts of a therapeutic agent delivered to the subject. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The methods and apparatus disclosed herein are well suited for treatment of both parents and children, for example. Both a parent and a child can receive separate treatments as described herein. For example, neurological condition of the parent can be monitored and treated, and the developmental progress of the child monitored and treated. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The mobile device used to acquire data of the subject can be configured in many ways and may combine a plurality of devices, for example. Sleep patterns can be related to autism, for example, and sleep data acquired and used as input to the diagnostic and therapeutic modules as described herein. The mobile device may comprise a mobile wearable for sleep monitoring for a child, which can be provide as input for diagnosis and treatment and may comprise a component of the feedback loop as described herein. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Many types of sensor, biosensors and data can be used to gather data of the subject and input into the diagnosis and treatment of the subject. For example, work in relation to embodiments suggests that microbiome data can be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of Autism. The microbiome data can be collected in many ways known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and may comprise data selected from a stool sample, intestinal lavage, or other sample of the flora of the subject's intestinal track. Genetic data can also be acquired an input into the diagnostic and therapeutic modules. The genetic data may comprise full genomic sequencing of the subject, of sequencing and identification of specific markers. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The diagnostic and therapeutic modules as disclosed herein can receive data from a plurality of sources, such as data acquired from the group consisting of genetic data, floral data, a sleep sensor, a wearable anklet sleep monitor, a booty to monitor sleep, and eye tracking of the subject. The eye tracking can be performed in many ways to determine the direction and duration of gaze. The tracking can be done glasses, helmets other sensors for direction and duration of gaze. The data can be acquired with any combination of games, video games, captured video of the subject and these can be used to determine facial expression and gaze of the subject. This data can be acquired and provided to the therapeutic module and diagnostic module as described herein before, during and after treatment, in order to initially diagnose the subject, determine treatment of the subject, modify treatment of the subject, and monitor the subject subsequent to treatment. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The visual gaze, duration of gaze and facial expression information can be acquired with methods and apparatus known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and acquired an input into the diagnostic and therapeutic modules. The data can be acquired with an app comprising software instructions, which can be downloaded. For example, facial processing has been described by Gloarai et al. “Autism and the development of face processing”, Clinical Neuroscience Research 6 (2006) 145-160. An autism research group at Duke University has been conducting the Autism and beyond research study with a software app downloaded onto mobile devices as described on the web page at autismandbeyond.researchkit.duke.edu. Data from such devices is particularly well suited for combination in accordance with the present disclosure. Facial recognition data and gaze data can be input into the diagnostic and therapeutic modules as described herein. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The classifiers as disclosed herein are particularly well suited for combination with this data to provide improved therapy and treatment. The data can be stratified and used with a feedback loop as described herein. For example, the feedback data can be used in combination with a drug therapy to determine differential responses and identify responders and non-responders. Alternatively or in combination, the feedback data can be combined with non-drug therapy, such as behavioral therapy. {\textbar}   {\textbar} With regards to genetics, recent work suggests that some people may have genetics that make them more susceptible to Autism. The genetic composition of the subject may render the subject more susceptible to environmental influences, which can result symptoms and may influence the severity of symptoms. The environmental influence may comprise an insult from a toxin, virus or other substance, for example. Without being bound by any particular theory, this may result in mechanisms that change the regulation of expression genes. The change in expression of genes may be related to change in gastro-intestinal (“GI”) flora, and these changes in flora may affect symptoms related to Autism. Alternatively or in combination, an insult to the intestinal microbiome may result in a change in the microbiome of the subject, resulting in the subject having less than ideal homeostasis, which may affect associated symptoms related to Autism. The inventors note that preliminary studies with  {\textbar}   {\textbar} B. fragilis {\textbar}  conducted by Sarkis K. Mazmanian and others, suggest changes in this micro-organism can be related to autism and the development of autisms. (See also, “Gut Bacteria May Play a Role in Autism” by Melinda Wenner Moyer,  {\textbar} Scientific American {\textbar} , Sep. 1, 2014) {\textbar} The digital diagnostic uses the data collected by the system about the patient, which may include complimentary diagnostic data captured outside the digital diagnostic, with analysis from tools such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to assess or diagnose the patient's condition. The digital diagnostic can also provide assessment of a patient's change in state or performance, directly or indirectly via data and meta-data that can be analyzed by tools such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling to provide feedback into the system to improve or refine the diagnoses and potential therapeutic interventions. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Data assessment and machine learning from the digital diagnostic and corresponding responses, or lack thereof, from the therapeutic interventions can lead to the identification of novel diagnoses for patients and novel therapeutic regimens for both patents and caregivers. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Types of data collected and utilized by the system can include patient and caregiver video, audio, responses to questions or activities, and active or passive data streams from user interaction with activities, games or software features of the system, for example. Such data can also include meta-data from patient or caregiver interaction with the system, for example, when performing recommended activities. Specific meta-data examples include data from a user's interaction with the system's device or mobile app that captures aspects of the user's behaviors, profile, activities, interactions with the software system, interactions with games, frequency of use, session time, options or features selected, and content and activity preferences. Data may also include data and meta-data from various third party devices such as activity monitors, games or interactive content. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Digital therapeutics as described herein can comprise of instructions, feedback, activities or interactions provided to the patient or caregiver by the system. Examples include suggested behaviors, activities, games or interactive sessions with system software and/or third party devices (for example, the Internet of Things “IoT” enabled therapeutic devices as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art). {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 1A {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a system diagram for a digital personalized medicine platform  {\textbar} 100 {\textbar}  for providing diagnosis and therapy related to behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. The platform  {\textbar} 100 {\textbar}  can provide diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cognitive and behavioral conditions associated with developmental delays, for example. A user digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} —for example, a mobile device such as a smart phone, an activity monitors, or a wearable digital monitor—records data and metadata related to a patient. Data may be collected based on interactions of the patient with the device, as well as based on interactions with caregivers and health care professionals. The data may be collected actively, such as by administering tests, recording speech and/or video, and recording responses to diagnostic questions. The data may also be collected passively, such as by monitoring online behavior of patients and caregivers, such as recording questions asked and topics investigated relating to a diagnosed developmental disorder. {\textbar} The digital device  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 110 {\textbar}  is connected to a computer network  {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} , allowing it to share data with and receive data from connected computers. In particular, the device can communicate with personalized medical system  {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} , which comprises a server configured to communicate with digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar}  over the computer network  {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} . Personalized medical system  {\textbar} 130 {\textbar}  comprises a diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  to provide initial and incremental diagnosis of a patient's developmental status, as well as a therapeutic module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  to provide personalized therapy recommendations in response to the diagnoses of diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} . {\textbar} Each of diagnosis modules  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  and  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  communicate with the user digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar}  during a course of treatment. The diagnosis module provides diagnostic tests to and receives diagnostic feedback from the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , and uses the feedback to determine a diagnosis of a patient. An initial diagnosis may be based on a comprehensive set of tests and questions, for example, while incremental updates may be made to a diagnosis using smaller data samples. For example, the diagnostic module may diagnose autism-related speech delay based on questions asked to the caregiver and tests administered to the patient such as vocabulary or verbal communication tests. The diagnosis may indicate a number of months or years delay in speech abilities. Later tests may be administered and questions asked to update this diagnosis, for example showing a smaller or larger degree of delay. {\textbar} The diagnosis module communicates its diagnosis to the digital device  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , as well as to therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} , which uses the diagnosis to suggest therapies to be performed to treat any diagnosed symptoms. The therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  sends its recommended therapies to the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , including instructions for the patient and caregivers to perform the therapies recommended over a given time frame. After performing the therapies over the given time frame, the caregivers or patient can indicate completion of the recommended therapies, and a report can be sent from the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar}  to the therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} . The therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  can then indicate to the diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  that the latest round of therapy is finished, and that a new diagnosis is needed. The diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  can then provide new diagnostic tests and questions to the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , as well as take input from the therapy module of any data provided as part of therapy, such as recordings of learning sessions or browsing history of caregivers or patients related to the therapy or diagnosed condition. The diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  then provides an updated diagnosis to repeat the process and provide a next step of therapy. {\textbar} Information related to diagnosis and therapy can also be provided from personalized medical system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 130 {\textbar}  to a third-party system  {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} , such as a computer system of a health care professional. The health care professional or other third party can be alerted to significant deviations from a therapy schedule, including whether a patient is falling behind an expected schedule or is improving faster than predicted. Appropriate further action can then be taken by the third party based on this provided information. {\textbar} FIG. 1B {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a detailed diagram of diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} . The diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  comprises a test administration module  {\textbar} 142 {\textbar}  that generates tests and corresponding instructions for administration to a subject. The diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  also comprises a subject data receiving module  {\textbar} 144 {\textbar}  in which subject data are received, such as test results; caregiver feedback; meta-data from patient and caregiver interactions with the system; and video, audio, and gaming interactions with the system, for example. A subject assessment module  {\textbar} 146 {\textbar}  generates a diagnosis of the subject based on the data from subject data receiving module  {\textbar} 144 {\textbar} , as well as past diagnoses of the subject and of similar subjects. A machine learning module  {\textbar} 148 {\textbar}  assesses the relative sensitivity of each input to the diagnosis to determine which types of measurement provide the most information regarding a patient's diagnosis. These results can be used by test administration module  {\textbar} 142 {\textbar}  to provide tests which most efficiently inform diagnoses and by subject assessment module  {\textbar} 146 {\textbar}  to apply weights to diagnosis data in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Diagnostic data relating to each treated patient are stored, for example in a database, to form a library of diagnostic data for pattern matching and machine learning. A large number of subject profiles can be simultaneously stored in such a database, for example 10,000 or more. {\textbar} FIG. 1C {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a detailed diagram of therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} . Therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  comprises a therapy assessment module  {\textbar} 152 {\textbar}  that scores therapies based on their effectiveness. A previously suggested therapy is evaluated based on the diagnoses provided by the diagnostic module both before and after the therapy, and a degree of improvement is determined. This degree of improvement is used to score the effectiveness of the therapy. The therapy may have its effectiveness correlated with particular classes of diagnosis; for example, a therapy may be considered effective for subjects with one type of diagnosis but ineffective for subjects with a second type of diagnosis. A therapy matching module  {\textbar} 154 {\textbar}  is also provided that compares the diagnosis of the subject from diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  with a list of therapies to determine a set of therapies that have been determined by the therapy assessment module  {\textbar} 152 {\textbar}  to be most effective at treating diagnoses similar to the subject's diagnosis. Therapy recommendation module  {\textbar} 156 {\textbar}  then generates a recommended therapy comprising one or more of the therapies identified as promising by the therapy matching module  {\textbar} 154 {\textbar} , and sends that recommendation to the subject with instructions for administration of the recommended therapies. Therapy tracking module  {\textbar} 158 {\textbar}  then tracks the progress of the recommended therapies, and determines when a new diagnosis should be performed by diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} , or when a given therapy should be continued and progress further monitored. Therapeutic data relating to each patient treated are stored, for example in a database, to form a library of therapeutic data for pattern matching and machine learning. A large number of subject profiles can be simultaneously stored in such a database, for example 10,000 or more. The therapeutic data can be correlated to the diagnostic data of the diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  to allow a matching of effective therapies to diagnoses. {\textbar} A therapy can comprise a digital therapy. A digital therapy can comprise a single or multiplicity of therapeutic activities or interventions that can be performed by the patient or caregiver. The digital therapeutic can include prescribed interactions with third party devices such as sensors, computers, medical devices and therapeutic delivery systems. Digital therapies can support an FDA approved medical claim, a set of diagnostic codes, a single diagnostic code {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 2 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a method  {\textbar} 200 {\textbar}  for diagnosis and therapy to be provided in a digital personalized medicine platform. The digital personalized medicine platform communicates with a subject, which may include a patient with one or more caregivers, to provide diagnoses and recommend therapies. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 210 {\textbar}  the diagnosis module assesses the subject to determine a diagnosis, for example by applying diagnostic tests to the subject. The diagnostic tests may be directed at determining a plurality of features and corresponding feature values for the subject. For example, the tests may include a plurality of questions presented to a subject, observations of the subject, or tasks assigned to the subject. The tests may also include indirect tests of the subject, such as feedback from a caregiver of patient performance versus specific behaviors and/or milestones; meta-data from patient and caregiver interactions with the system; and video, audio, and gaming interactions with the system or with third party tools that provide data on patient and caregiver behavior and performance. For initial tests, a more comprehensive testing regimen may be performed, aimed at generating an accurate initial diagnosis. Later testing used to update prior diagnoses to track progress can involve less comprehensive testing and may, for example, rely more on indirect tests such as behavioral tracking and therapy-related recordings and meta-data. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 212 {\textbar} , the diagnosis module receives new data from the subject. The new data can comprise an array of features and corresponding feature values for a particular subject. As described herein, the features may comprise a plurality of questions presented to a subject, observations of the subject, or tasks assigned to the subject. The feature values may comprise input data from the subject corresponding to characteristics of the subject, such as answers of the subject to questions asked, or responses of the subject. The feature values may also comprise recorded feedback, meta-data, and system interaction data as described above. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 214 {\textbar} , the diagnosis module can load a previously saved assessment model from a local memory and/or a remote server configured to store the model. Alternatively, if no assessment model exists for the patient, a default model may be loaded, for example, based on one or more initial diagnostic indications. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 216 {\textbar} , the new data is fitted to the assessment model to generate an updated assessment model. This assessment model may comprise an initial diagnosis for a previously untreated subject, or an updated diagnosis for a previously treated subject. The updated diagnosis can include a measurement of progress in one or more aspects of a condition, such as memory, attention and joint attention, cognition, behavioral response, emotional response, language use, language skill, frequency of specific behaviors, sleep, socialization, non-verbal communication, and developmental milestones. The analysis of the data to determine progress and current diagnosis can include automated analysis such as question scoring and voice-recognition for vocabulary and speech analysis. The analysis can also include human scoring by analysis reviewing video, audio, and text data. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 218 {\textbar} , the updated assessment model is provided to the therapy module, which determines what progress has been made as a result of any previously recommended therapy. The therapy module scores the therapy based on the amount of progress in the assessment model, with larger progress corresponding to a higher score, making a successful therapy and similar therapies more likely to be recommended to subjects with similar assessments in the future. The set of therapies available is thus updated to reflect a new assessment of effectiveness, as correlated with the subject's diagnosis. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 220 {\textbar} , a new therapy is recommended based on the assessment model, the degree of success of the previous therapy, if any, and the scores assigned to a collection of candidate therapies based on previous uses of those therapies with the subject and other subjects with similar assessments. The recommended therapy is sent to the subject for administration, along with instructions of a particular span of time to apply it. For example, a therapy might include a language drill to be performed with the patient daily for one week, with each drill to be recorded in an audio file in a mobile device used by a caregiver or the patient. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 222 {\textbar} , progress of the new therapy is monitored to determine whether to extend a period of therapy. This monitoring may include periodic re-diagnoses, which may be performed by returning to step  {\textbar} 210 {\textbar} . Alternatively, basic milestones may be recorded without a full re-diagnosis, and progress may be compared to a predicted progress schedule generated by the therapy module. For example, if a therapy is unsuccessful initially, the therapy module may suggest repeating it one or more times before either re-diagnosing and suggesting a new therapy or suggesting intervention by medical professionals. {\textbar} FIG. 3 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a flow diagram  {\textbar} 300 {\textbar}  showing the handling of suspected or confirmed speech and language delay. {\textbar} In step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 302 {\textbar}  an initial assessment is determined by diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} . The initial assessment can assess the patient's performance in one or more domains, such as speech and language use, and assess a degree and type of developmental delay along a number of axes, as disclosed herein. The assessment can further place the subject into one of a plurality of overall tracks of progress; for example, the subject can be assessed as verbal or nonverbal. {\textbar} If the subject is determined to be non-verbal, as in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 310 {\textbar} , one or more non-verbal therapies  {\textbar} 312 {\textbar}  can be recommended by the therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} , such as tasks related to making choices, paying attention to tasks, or responding to a name or other words. Further suggestions of useful devices and products that may be helpful for progress may also be provided, and all suggestions can be tailored to the subject's needs as indicated by the subject's diagnosis and progress reports. {\textbar} While applying the recommended therapies, progress is monitored in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 314 {\textbar}  to determine whether a diagnosis has improved at a predicted rate. {\textbar} If improvement has been measured in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 314 {\textbar} , the system determines whether the subject is still non-verbal in step  {\textbar} 316 {\textbar} ; if so, then the system returns to step  {\textbar} 310 {\textbar}  and generates a new recommended therapy  {\textbar} 312 {\textbar}  to induce further improvements. {\textbar} If no improvement is measured in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 314 {\textbar} , the system can recommend that the therapy be repeated a predetermined number of times. The system may also recommend trying variations in therapy to try and get better results. If such repetitions and variations fail, the system can recommend a therapist visit in step  {\textbar} 318 {\textbar}  to more directly address the problems impeding development. {\textbar} Once the subject is determined to be verbal, as indicated in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 320 {\textbar} , verbal therapies  {\textbar} 322 {\textbar}  can be generated by therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} . For example, verbal therapies  {\textbar} 322 {\textbar}  can include one or more of language drills, articulation exercises, and expressive requesting or communicating. Further suggestions of useful devices and products that may be helpful for progress may also be provided, and all suggestions can be tailored to the subject's needs as indicated by the subject's diagnosis and progress reports. {\textbar} As in the non-verbal track, progress in response to verbal therapies is continually monitored in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 324 {\textbar}  to determine whether a diagnosis has improved at a predicted rate. {\textbar} If improvement has been measured in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 324 {\textbar} , the system reports on the progress in step  {\textbar} 326 {\textbar}  and generates a new recommended therapy  {\textbar} 322 {\textbar}  to induce further improvements. {\textbar} If no improvement is detected in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 324 {\textbar} , the system can recommend that the therapy be repeated a predetermined number of times. The system may also recommend trying variations in therapy to try and get better results. If such repetitions and variations fail, the system can recommend a therapist visit in step  {\textbar} 328 {\textbar}  to more directly address the problems impeding development. {\textbar} The steps for non-verbal and verbal therapy can be repeated indefinitely, to the degree needed to stimulate continued learning and progress in the subject, and to prevent or retard regress through loss of verbal skills and abilities. While the specific therapy plan illustrated in  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 3 {\textbar}  is directed towards pediatric speech and language delay similar plans may be generated for other subjects with developmental or cognitive issues, including plans for adult patients. For example, neurodegenerative conditions and/or age related cognitive decline may be treated with similar diagnosis and therapy schedules, using treatments selected to be appropriate to such conditions. Further conditions that may be treated in adult or pediatric patients by the methods and systems disclosed herein include mood disorders such as depression, OCD, and schizophrenia; cognitive impairment and decline; sleep disorders; addictive behaviors; eating disorders; and behavior related weight management problems. {\textbar} FIG. 4 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates an overall of data processing flows for a digital personalized medical system comprising a diagnostic module and a therapeutic module, configured to integrate information from multiple sources. Data can include passive data sources ( {\textbar} 501 {\textbar} ), passive data can be configured to provide more fine grained information, and can comprise data sets taken over longer periods of time under more nature conditions. Passive data sources can including for example, data collected from wearable devices, data collected from video feed (e.g. video feed collected from a video-enable toy, a mobile device, eye tracking data from video footage, information on the dexterity of a subject based on information gathered from three-axis sensors or gyroscopes (e.g. sensors embedded in toys or other devices that the patient may interact with for example at home, or under normal conditions outside of a medical setting), smart devices that measure any single or combination of the following: subject's speech patterns, motions, touch response time, prosody, lexical analysis, facial expressions, and other characteristic expressed by the subject. Passive data can comprise data on the motion or motions of the user, and can include subtle information that may or may not be readily detectable to an untrained individual. In some instances, passive data can provide information that can be more encompassing. {\textbar} Passively collected data can comprise data collected continuously from a variety of environments. Passively collected data can provide a more complete picture of the subject and thus can improve the quality of an assessment. In some instances, for example, passively collected data can include data collected both inside and outside of a medical setting. Passively collected data taken in a medical setting can differ from passively collected data taken from outside a medical setting. Therefore, continuously collected passive data can comprise a more complete picture of a subject's general behavior and mannerisms, and thus can include data or information that a medical practitioner would not otherwise have access to. For example, a subject undergoing evaluation in a medical setting may display symptoms, gestures, or features that are representative of the subject's response to the medical environment, and thus may not provide a complete and accurate picture of the subject's behavior outside of the medical environment under more familiar conditions. The relative importance of one or more features (e.g. features assessed by a diagnostic module) derived from an assessment in the medical environment, may differ from the relative importance of one or more features derived from or assessed outside the clinical setting. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Data can comprise information collected through diagnostic tests, diagnostic questions, or questionnaires ( {\textbar}   {\textbar} 505 {\textbar} ). In some instances, data from diagnostic tests ( {\textbar} 505 {\textbar} ) can comprise data collected from a secondary observer (e.g. a parent, guardian, or individual that is not the subject being analyzed). Data can include active data sources ( {\textbar} 510 {\textbar} ), for example data collected from devices configured for tracking eye movement, or measuring or analyzing speech patterns. {\textbar} As illustrated in  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 4 {\textbar} , data inputs can be fed into a diagnostic module which can comprising data analysis ( {\textbar} 515 {\textbar} ) using for example a classifier, algorithm (e.g. machine learning algorithm), or statistical model, to make a diagnosis of whether the subject is likely to have a tested disorder (e.g. Autism Spectrum Disorder) ( {\textbar} 520 {\textbar} ) or is unlikely to have the tested disorder ( {\textbar} 525 {\textbar} ). In instances where the subject is likely to have the disorder ( {\textbar} 520 {\textbar} ), a secondary party (e.g. medical practitioner, parent, guardian or other individual) may be presented with an informative display. An informative display can provide symptoms of the disorder that can be displayed as a graph depicting covariance of symptoms displayed by the subject and symptoms displayed by the average population. A list of characteristics associated with a particular diagnosis can be displayed with confidence values, correlation coefficients, or other means for displaying the relationship between a subject's performance and the average population or a population comprised of those with a similar disorders. {\textbar} If the digital personalized medicine system predicts that the user is likely to have a diagnosable condition (e.g. Autism Spectrum Disorder), then a therapy module can provide a behavioral treatment ( {\textbar}   {\textbar} 530 {\textbar} ) which can comprise behavioral interventions; prescribed activities or trainings; interventions with medical devices or other therapeutics for specific durations or, at specific times or instances. As the subject undergoes the therapy, data (e.g. passive data and diagnostic question data) can continue to be collected to perform follow-up assessments, to determine for example, whether the therapy is working. Collected data can undergo data analysis ( {\textbar} 540 {\textbar} ) (e.g. analysis using machine learning, statistical modeling, classification tasks, predictive algorithms) to make determinations about the suitability of a given subject. A growth curve display can be used to show the subject's progress against a baseline (e.g. against an age-matched cohort). Performance or progress of the individual may be measured to track compliance for the subject with a suggested behavioral therapy predicted by the therapy module may be presented as a historic and predicted performance on a growth curve. Procedures for assessing the performance of an individual subject may be repeated or iterated ( {\textbar} 535 {\textbar} ) until an appropriate behavioral treatment is identified. {\textbar} The digital therapeutics treatment methods and apparatus described with reference to  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIGS. 1-4 {\textbar}  are particularly well suited for combination with the methods and apparatus to evaluate subjects with fewer questions described herein with reference to  {\textbar} FIGS. 5A to 14 {\textbar} . For example the components of diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  as described herein can be configured to assess the subject with the decreased set of questions comprising the most relevant question as described herein, and subsequently evaluated with the therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  to subsequently assess the subject with subsequent set of questions comprising the most relevant questions for monitoring treatment as described herein. {\textbar} FIGS. 5A and 5B {\textbar}   {\textbar}  show some exemplary behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders that may be diagnosed and treated using the method for diagnosis and therapy as described herein. The diagnostic tests can be configured to evaluate a subject's risk for having one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders, such as two or more related behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. The behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders may have at least some overlap in symptoms or features of the subject. Such behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders may include pervasive development disorder (PDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), social communication disorder, restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities (RRBs), autism (“classical autism”), Asperger's Syndrome (“high functioning autism), PDD-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, “atypical autism”), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech and language delay, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), intellectual disability, learning disability, or any other relevant development disorder, such as disorders defined in any edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The diagnostic tests may be configured to determine the risk of the subject for having each of a plurality of disorders. The diagnostic tests may be configured to determine the subject as at greater risk of a first disorder or a second disorder of the plurality of disorders. The diagnostic tests may be configured to determine the subject as at risk of a first disorder and a second disorder with comorbidity. The diagnostic tests may be configured to predict a subject to have normal development, or have low risk of having any of the disorders the procedure is configured to screen for. The diagnostic tests may further be configured to have high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish among different severity ratings for a disorder; for example, the procedure may be configured to predict a subject's risk for having level 1 ASD, level 2 ASD, or level 3 ASD as defined in the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-V). {\textbar} Many behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders may have similar or overlapping symptoms, thus complicating the assessment of a subject's developmental disorder. The diagnostic tests described herein can be configured to evaluate a plurality of features of the subject that may be relevant to one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. The procedure can comprise an assessment model that has been trained using a large set of clinically validated data to learn the statistical relationship between a feature of a subject and clinical diagnosis of one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. Thus, as a subject participates in the diagnostic tests, the subject's feature value for each evaluated feature (e.g., subject's answer to a question) can be queried against the assessment model to identify the statistical correlation, if any, of the subject's feature value to one or more screened behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. Based on the feature values provided by the subject, and the relationship between those values and the predicted risk for one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders as determined by the assessment model, the diagnostic tests can dynamically adjust the selection of next features to be evaluated in the subject. The selection of the next feature to be evaluated may comprise an identification of the next most predictive feature, based on the determination of the subject as at risk for a particular disorder of the plurality of disorders being screened. For example, if after the subject has answered the first five questions of the diagnostic tests, the assessment model predicts a low risk of autism and a relatively higher risk of ADHD in the subject, the diagnostic tests may select features with higher relevance to ADHD to be evaluated next in the subject (e.g., questions whose answers are highly correlated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD may be presented next to the subject). Thus, the diagnostic tests described herein can be dynamically tailored to a particular subject's risk profile, and enable the evaluation of the subject's disorder with a high level of granularity. {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 6 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  is a schematic diagram of an exemplary data processing module  {\textbar} 600 {\textbar}  for providing an assessment procedure for screening a subject for cognitive function as described herein, which may comprise one or more of a plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders or conditions. The assessment procedure can evaluate a plurality of features or characteristics of the subject related to cognitive function, wherein each feature can be related to the likelihood of the subject having at least one of the plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders screenable by the procedure, for example. The assessment procedure can be administered to a subject or a caretaker of the subject with a user interface provided by a computing device. In some examples, the assessment procedure may take less than 60 minutes, 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 10 minutes or less to administer to the subject. In some examples, the data processing module  {\textbar} 600 {\textbar}  can be at least a part of the diagnosis module as described herein. The data processing module  {\textbar} 600 {\textbar}  generally comprises a preprocessing module  {\textbar} 605 {\textbar} , a training module  {\textbar} 610 {\textbar} , and a prediction module  {\textbar} 620 {\textbar} . The data processing module can extract training data  {\textbar} 650 {\textbar}  from a database, or intake new data  {\textbar} 655 {\textbar}  with a user interface  {\textbar} 630 {\textbar} . The preprocessing module can apply one or more transformations to standardize the training data or new data for the training module or the prediction module. The preprocessed training data can be passed to the training module, which can construct an assessment model  {\textbar} 660 {\textbar}  based on the training data. The training module may further comprise a validation module  {\textbar} 615 {\textbar} , configured to validate the trained assessment model using any appropriate validation algorithm (e.g., Stratified K-fold cross-validation). The preprocessed new data can be passed on to the prediction module, which may output a prediction  {\textbar} 670 {\textbar}  of the subject's developmental disorder by fitting the new data to the assessment model constructed in the training module. The prediction module may further comprise a feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar} , configured to select or recommend the next feature to be evaluated in the subject, based on previously provided feature values for the subject. {\textbar} The training data  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 650 {\textbar} , used by the training module to construct the assessment model, can comprise a plurality of datasets from a plurality of subjects, each subject's dataset comprising an array of features and corresponding feature values, and a classification of the subject's developmental disorder or condition. As described herein, the features may be evaluated in the subject via one or more of questions asked to the subject, observations of the subject, or structured interactions with the subject. Feature values may comprise one or more of answers to the questions, observations of the subject such as characterizations based on video images, or responses of the subject to a structured interaction, for example. Each feature may be relevant to the identification of one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders or conditions, and each corresponding feature value may indicate the degree of presence of the feature in the specific subject. For example, a feature may be the ability of the subject to engage in imaginative or pretend play, and the feature value for a particular subject may be a score of either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 8, wherein each score corresponds to the degree of presence of the feature in the subject (e.g., 0=variety of pretend play; 1=some pretend play; 2=occasional pretending or highly repetitive pretend play; 3=no pretend play; 8=not applicable). The feature may be evaluated in the subject by way of a question presented to the subject or a caretaker such as a parent, wherein the answer to the question comprises the feature value. Alternatively or in combination, the feature may be observed in the subject, for example with a video of the subject engaging in a certain behavior, and the feature value may be identified through the observation. In addition to the array of features and corresponding feature values, each subject's dataset in the training data also comprises a classification of the subject. For example, the classification may be autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or non-spectrum. Preferably, the classification comprises a clinical diagnosis, assigned by qualified personnel such as licensed clinical psychologists, in order to improve the predictive accuracy of the generated assessment model. The training data may comprise datasets available from large data repositories, such as Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) data and/or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) data available from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), or any datasets available from any other suitable repository of data (e.g., Boston Autism Consortium (AC), Simons Foundation, National Database for Autism Research, etc.). Alternatively or in combination, the training data may comprise large self-reported datasets, which can be crowd-sourced from users (e.g., via websites, mobile applications, etc.). {\textbar} The preprocessing module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 605 {\textbar}  can be configured to apply one or more transformations to the extracted training data to clean and normalize the data, for example. The preprocessing module can be configured to discard features which contain spurious metadata or contain very few observations. The preprocessing module can be further configured to standardize the encoding of feature values. Different datasets may often have the same feature value encoded in different ways, depending on the source of the dataset. For example, ‘900’, ‘900.0’, ‘904’, ‘904.0’, ‘−1’, ‘−1.0’, ‘None’, and ‘NaN’ may all encode for a “missing” feature value. The preprocessing module can be configured to recognize the encoding variants for the same feature value, and standardize the datasets to have a uniform encoding for a given feature value. The preprocessing module can thus reduce irregularities in the input data for the training and prediction modules, thereby improving the robustness of the training and prediction modules. {\textbar} In addition to standardizing data, the preprocessing module can also be configured to re-encode certain feature values into a different data representation. In some instances, the original data representation of the feature values in a dataset may not be ideal for the construction of an assessment model. For example, for a categorical feature wherein the corresponding feature values are encoded as integers from 1 to 9, each integer value may have a different semantic content that is independent of the other values. For example, a value of ‘1’ and a value of ‘9’ may both be highly correlated with a specific classification, while a value of ‘5’ is not. The original data representation of the feature value, wherein the feature value is encoded as the integer itself, may not be able to capture the unique semantic content of each value, since the values are represented in a linear model (e.g., an answer of ‘5’ would place the subject squarely between a ‘1’ and a ‘9’ when the feature is considered in isolation; however, such an interpretation would be incorrect in the aforementioned case wherein a ‘1’ and a ‘9’ are highly correlated with a given classification while a ‘5’ is not). To ensure that the semantic content of each feature value is captured in the construction of the assessment model, the preprocessing module may comprise instructions to re-encode certain feature values, such as feature values corresponding to categorical features, in a “one-hot” fashion, for example. In a “one-hot” representation, a feature value may be represented as an array of bits having a value of 0 or 1, the number of bits corresponding to the number of possible values for the feature. Only the feature value for the subject may be represented as a “1”, with all other values represented as a “0”. For example, if a subject answered “4” to a question whose possible answers comprise integers from 1 to 9, the original data representation may be [4], and the one-hot representation may be [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]. Such a one-hot representation of feature values can allow every value to be considered independently of the other possible values, in cases where such a representation would be necessary. By thus re-encoding the training data using the most appropriate data representation for each feature, the preprocessing module can improve the accuracy of the assessment model constructed using the training data. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The preprocessing module can be further configured to impute any missing data values, such that downstream modules can correctly process the data. For example, if a training dataset provided to the training module comprises data missing an answer to one of the questions, the preprocessing module can provide the missing value, so that the dataset can be processed correctly by the training module. Similarly, if a new dataset provided to the prediction module is missing one or more feature values (e.g., the dataset being queried comprises only the answer to the first question in a series of questions to be asked), the preprocessing module can provide the missing values, so as to enable correct processing of the dataset by the prediction module. For features having categorical feature values (e.g., extent of display of a certain behavior in the subject), missing values can be provided as appropriate data representations specifically designated as such. For example, if the categorical features are encoded in a one-hot representation as described herein, the preprocessing module may encode a missing categorical feature value as an array of ‘0’ bits. For features having continuous feature values (e.g., age of the subject), the mean of all of the possible values can be provided in place of the missing value (e.g., age of 4 years). {\textbar}   {\textbar} The training module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 610 {\textbar}  can utilize a machine learning algorithm or other algorithm to construct and train an assessment model to be used in the diagnostic tests, for example. An assessment model can be constructed to capture, based on the training data, the statistical relationship, if any, between a given feature value and a specific developmental disorder to be screened by the diagnostic tests. The assessment model may, for example, comprise the statistical correlations between a plurality of clinical characteristics and clinical diagnoses of one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. A given feature value may have a different predictive utility for classifying each of the plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders to be evaluated in the diagnostic tests. For example, in the aforementioned example of a feature comprising the ability of the subject to engage in imaginative or pretend play, the feature value of “3” or “no variety of pretend play” may have a high predictive utility for classifying autism, while the same feature value may have low predictive utility for classifying ADHD. Accordingly, for each feature value, a probability distribution may be extracted that describes the probability of the specific feature value for predicting each of the plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders to be screened by the diagnostic tests. The machine learning algorithm can be used to extract these statistical relationships from the training data and build an assessment model that can yield an accurate prediction of a developmental disorder when a dataset comprising one or more feature values is fitted to the model. {\textbar} One or more machine learning algorithms may be used to construct the assessment model, such as support vector machines that deploy stepwise backwards feature selection and/or graphical models, both of which can have advantages of inferring interactions between features. For example, machine learning algorithms or other statistical algorithms may be used, such as alternating decision trees (ADTree), Decision Stumps, functional trees (FT), logistic model trees (LMT), logistic regression, Random Forests, linear classifiers, or any machine learning algorithm or statistical algorithm known in the art. One or more algorithms may be used together to generate an ensemble method, wherein the ensemble method may be optimized using a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm such as a boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, LPBoost, TotalBoost, BrownBoost, MadaBoost, LogitBoost, etc.) to reduce bias and/or variance. Once an assessment model is derived from the training data, the model may be used as a prediction tool to assess the risk of a subject for having one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. Machine learning analyses may be performed using one or more of many programming languages and platforms known in the art, such as R, Weka, Python, and/or Matlab, for example. {\textbar}   {\textbar} A Random Forest classifier, which generally comprises a plurality of decision trees wherein the output prediction is the mode of the predicted classifications of the individual trees, can be helpful in reducing overfitting to training data. An ensemble of decision trees can be constructed using a random subset of features at each split or decision node. The Gini criterion may be employed to choose the best partition, wherein decision nodes having the lowest calculated Gini impurity index are selected. At prediction time, a “vote” can be taken over all of the decision trees, and the majority vote (or mode of the predicted classifications) can be output as the predicted classification. {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  is a schematic diagram illustrating a portion of an exemplary assessment model  {\textbar} 660 {\textbar}  based on a Random Forest classifier. The assessment module may comprise a plurality of individual decision trees  {\textbar} 765 {\textbar} , such as decision trees  {\textbar} 765 {\textbar} a {\textbar}  and  {\textbar} 765 {\textbar} b {\textbar} , each of which can be generated independently using a random subset of features in the training data. Each decision tree may comprise one or more decision nodes such as decision nodes  {\textbar} 766 {\textbar}  and  {\textbar} 767 {\textbar}  shown in  {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar} , wherein each decision node specifies a predicate condition. For example, decision node  {\textbar} 766 {\textbar}  predicates the condition that, for a given dataset of an individual, the answer to ADI-R question \#86 (age when abnormality is first evident) is 4 or less. Decision node  {\textbar} 767 {\textbar}  predicates the condition that, for the given dataset, the answer to ADI-R question \#52 (showing and direction attention) is 8 or less. At each decision node, a decision tree can be split based on whether the predicate condition attached to the decision node holds true, leading to prediction nodes (e.g.,  {\textbar} 766 {\textbar} a {\textbar} ,  {\textbar} 766 {\textbar} b {\textbar} ,  {\textbar} 767 {\textbar} a {\textbar} ,  {\textbar} 767 {\textbar} b {\textbar} ). Each prediction node can comprise output values (‘value’ in  {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar} ) that represent “votes” for one or more of the classifications or conditions being evaluated by the assessment model. For example, in the prediction nodes shown in  {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar} , the output values comprise votes for the individual being classified as having autism or being non-spectrum. A prediction node can lead to one or more additional decision nodes downstream (not shown in  {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar} ), each decision node leading to an additional split in the decision tree associated with corresponding prediction nodes having corresponding output values. The Gini impurity can be used as a criterion to find informative features based on which the splits in each decision tree may be constructed. {\textbar} When the dataset being queried in the assessment model reaches a “leaf”, or a final prediction node with no further downstream splits, the output values of the leaf can be output as the votes for the particular decision tree. Since the Random Forest model comprises a plurality of decision trees, the final votes across all trees in the forest can be summed to yield the final votes and the corresponding classification of the subject. While only two decision trees are shown in  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 7 {\textbar} , the model can comprise any number of decision trees. A large number of decision trees can help reduce overfitting of the assessment model to the training data, by reducing the variance of each individual decision tree. For example, the assessment model can comprise at least about 10 decision trees, for example at least about 100 individual decision trees or more. {\textbar} An ensemble of linear classifiers may also be suitable for the derivation of an assessment model as described herein. Each linear classifier can be individually trained with a stochastic gradient descent, without an “intercept term”. The lack of an intercept term can prevent the classifier from deriving any significance from missing feature values. For example, if a subject did not answer a question such that the feature value corresponding to said question is represented as an array of ‘0’ bits in the subject's data set, the linear classifier trained without an intercept term will not attribute any significance to the array of ‘0’ bits. The resultant assessment model can thereby avoid establishing a correlation between the selection of features or questions that have been answered by the subject and the final classification of the subject as determined by the model. Such an algorithm can help ensure that only the subject-provided feature values or answers, rather than the features or questions, are factored into the final classification of the subject. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The training module may comprise feature selection. One or more feature selection algorithms (such as support vector machine, convolutional neural nets) may be used to select features able to differentiate between individuals with and without certain behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. Different sets of features may be selected as relevant for the identification of different disorders. Stepwise backwards algorithms may be used along with other algorithms. The feature selection procedure may include a determination of an optimal number of features. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The training module may be configured to evaluate the performance of the derived assessment models. For example, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model in classifying data can be evaluated. The evaluation can be used as a guideline in selecting suitable machine learning algorithms or parameters thereof. The training module can thus update and/or refine the derived assessment model to maximize the specificity (the true negative rate) over sensitivity (the true positive rate). Such optimization may be particularly helpful when class imbalance or sample bias exists in training data. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In at least some instances, available training data may be skewed towards individuals diagnosed with a specific developmental disorder. In such instances, the training data may produce an assessment model reflecting that sample bias, such that the model assumes that subjects are at risk for the specific developmental disorder unless there is a strong case to be made otherwise. An assessment model incorporating such a particular sample bias can have less than ideal performance in generating predictions of new or unclassified data, since the new data may be drawn from a subject population which may not comprise a sample bias similar to that present in the training data. To reduce sample bias in constructing an assessment model using skewed training data, sample weighting may be applied in training the assessment model. Sample weighting can comprise lending a relatively greater degree of significance to a specific set of samples during the model training process. For example, during model training, if the training data is skewed towards individuals diagnosed with autism, higher significance can be attributed to the data from individuals not diagnosed with autism (e.g., up to 50 times more significance than data from individuals diagnosed with autism). Such a sample weighting technique can substantially balance the sample bias present in the training data, thereby producing an assessment model with reduced bias and improved accuracy in classifying data in the real world. To further reduce the contribution of training data sample bias to the generation of an assessment model, a boosting technique may be implemented during the training process. Boosting comprises an iterative process, wherein after one iteration of training, the weighting of each sample data point is updated. For example, samples that are misclassified after the iteration can be updated with higher significances. The training process may then be repeated with the updated weightings for the training data. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The training module may further comprise a validation module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 615 {\textbar}  configured to validate the assessment model constructed using the training data. For example, a validation module may be configured to implement a Stratified K-fold cross validation, wherein k represents the number of partitions that the training data is split into for cross validation. For example, k can be any integer greater than 1, such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, or possibly higher depending on risk of overfitting the assessment model to the training data. {\textbar} The training module may be configured to save a trained assessment model to a local memory and/or a remote server, such that the model can be retrieved for modification by the training module or for the generation of a prediction by the prediction module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 620 {\textbar} . {\textbar} FIG. 8 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  is an exemplary operational flow  {\textbar} 800 {\textbar}  of a method of a prediction module  {\textbar} 620 {\textbar}  as described herein. The prediction module  {\textbar} 620 {\textbar}  can be configured to generate a predicted classification (e.g., developmental disorder) of a given subject, by fitting new data to an assessment model constructed in the training module. At step  {\textbar} 805 {\textbar} , the prediction module can receive new data that may have been processed by the preprocessing module to standardize the data, for example by dropping spurious metadata, applying uniform encoding of feature values, re-encoding select features using different data representations, and/or imputing missing data points, as described herein. The new data can comprise an array of features and corresponding feature values for a particular subject. As described herein, the features may comprise a plurality of questions presented to a subject, observations of the subject, or tasks assigned to the subject. The feature values may comprise input data from the subject corresponding to characteristics of the subject, such as answers of the subject to questions asked, or responses of the subject. The new data provided to the prediction module may or may not have a known classification or diagnosis associated with the data; either way, the prediction module may not use any pre-assigned classification information in generating the predicted classification for the subject. The new data may comprise a previously-collected, complete dataset for a subject to be diagnosed or assessed for the risk of having one or more of a plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. Alternatively or in combination, the new data may comprise data collected in real time from the subject or a caretaker of the subject, for example with a user interface as described in further detail herein, such that the complete dataset can be populated in real time as each new feature value provided by the subject is sequentially queried against the assessment model. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 810 {\textbar} , the prediction module can load a previously saved assessment model, constructed by the training module, from a local memory and/or a remote server configured to store the model. At step  {\textbar} 815 {\textbar} , the new data is fitted to the assessment model to generate a predicted classification of the subject. At step  {\textbar} 820 {\textbar} , the module can check whether the fitting of the data can generate a prediction of one or more specific disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD, etc.) within a confidence interval exceeding a threshold value, for example within a 90\% or higher confidence interval, for example 95\% or more. If so, as shown in step  {\textbar} 825 {\textbar} , the prediction module can output the one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders as diagnoses of the subject or as disorders for which the subject is at risk. The prediction module may output a plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders for which the subject is determined to at risk beyond the set threshold, optionally presenting the plurality of disorders in order of risk. The prediction module may output one developmental disorder for which the subject is determined to be at greatest risk. The prediction module may output two or more development disorders for which the subject is determined to risk with comorbidity. The prediction module may output determined risk for each of the one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders in the assessment model. If the prediction module cannot fit the data to any specific developmental disorder within a confidence interval at or exceeding the designated threshold value, the prediction module may determine, in step  {\textbar} 830 {\textbar} , whether there are any additional features that can be queried. If the new data comprises a previously-collected, complete dataset, and the subject cannot be queried for any additional feature values, “no diagnosis” may be output as the predicted classification, as shown in step  {\textbar} 840 {\textbar} . If the new data comprises data collected in real time from the subject or caretaker during the prediction process, such that the dataset is updated with each new input data value provided to the prediction module and each updated dataset is fitted to the assessment model, the prediction module may be able to query the subject for additional feature values. If the prediction module has already obtained data for all features included in the assessment module, the prediction module may output “no diagnosis” as the predicted classification of the subject, as shown in step  {\textbar} 840 {\textbar} . If there are features that have not yet been presented to the subject, as shown in step  {\textbar} 835 {\textbar} , the prediction module may obtain additional input data values from the subject, for example by presenting additional questions to the subject. The updated dataset including the additional input data may then be fitted to the assessment model again (step  {\textbar} 815 {\textbar} ), and the loop may continue until the prediction module can generate an output. {\textbar} FIG. 9 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  is an exemplary operational flow  {\textbar} 900 {\textbar}  of a feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar}  as described herein by way of a non-limiting example. The prediction module may comprise a feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar} , configured to identify, select or recommend the next most predictive or relevant feature to be evaluated in the subject, based on previously provided feature values for the subject. For example, the feature recommendation module can be a question recommendation module, wherein the module can select the most predictive next question to be presented to a subject or caretaker, based on the answers to previously presented questions. The feature recommendation module can be configured to recommend one or more next questions or features having the highest predictive utility in classifying a particular subject's developmental disorder. The feature recommendation module can thus help to dynamically tailor the assessment procedure to the subject, so as to enable the prediction module to produce a prediction with a reduced length of assessment and improved sensitivity and accuracy. Further, the feature recommendation module can help improve the specificity of the final prediction generated by the prediction module, by selecting features to be presented to the subject that are most relevant in predicting one or more specific behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders that the particular subject is most likely to have, based on feature values previously provided by the subject. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 905 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can receive as input the data already obtained from the subject in the assessment procedure. The input subject data can comprise an array of features and corresponding feature values provided by the subject. At step  {\textbar} 910 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can select one or more features to be considered as “candidate features” for recommendation as the next feature(s) to be presented to one or more of the subject, caretaker or clinician. Features that have already been presented can be excluded from the group of candidate features to be considered. Optionally, additional features meeting certain criteria may also be excluded from the group of candidate features, as described in further detail herein. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 915 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can evaluate the “expected feature importance” of each candidate feature. The candidate features can be evaluated for their “expected feature importance”, or the estimated utility of each candidate feature in predicting a specific developmental disorder for the specific subject. The feature recommendation module may utilize an algorithm based on: (1) the importance or relevance of a specific feature value in predicting a specific developmental disorder; and (2) the probability that the subject may provide the specific feature value. For example, if the answer of “3” to ADOS question B {\textbar} 5 {\textbar}  is highly correlated with a classification of autism, this answer can be considered a feature value having high utility for predicting autism. If the subject at hand also has a high probability of answering “3” to said question B {\textbar} 5 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can determine this question to have high expected feature importance. An algorithm that can be used to determine the expected feature importance of a feature is described in further detail in reference to  {\textbar} FIG. 10 {\textbar} , for example. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 920 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can select one or more candidate features to be presented next to the subject, based on the expected feature importance of the features as determined in step  {\textbar} 915 {\textbar} . For example, the expected feature importance of each candidate feature may be represented as a score or a real number, which can then be ranked in comparison to other candidate features. The candidate feature having the desired rank, for example a top 10, top 5, top 3, top 2, or the highest rank, may be selected as the feature to the presented next to the subject. {\textbar} FIG. 10 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  is an exemplary operational flow  {\textbar} 1000 {\textbar}  of method of determining an expected feature importance determination algorithm  {\textbar} 627 {\textbar}  as performed by a feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar}  described herein. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1005 {\textbar} , the algorithm can determine the importance or relevance of a specific feature value in predicting a specific developmental disorder. The importance or relevance of a specific feature value in predicting a specific developmental disorder can be derived from the assessment model constructed using training data. Such a “feature value importance” can be conceptualized as a measure of how relevant a given feature value's role is, should it be present or not present, in determining a subject's final classification. For example, if the assessment model comprises a Random Forest classifier, the importance of a specific feature value can be a function of where that feature is positioned in the Random Forest classifier's branches. Generally, if the average position of the feature in the decision trees is relatively high, the feature can have relatively high feature importance. The importance of a feature value given a specific assessment model can be computed efficiently, either by the feature recommendation module or by the training module, wherein the training module may pass the computed statistics to the feature recommendation module. Alternatively, the importance of a specific feature value can be a function of the actual prediction confidence that would result if said feature value was provided by the subject. For each possible feature value for a given candidate feature, the feature recommendation module can be configured to calculate the actual prediction confidence for predicting one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders, based on the subject's previously provided feature values and the currently assumed feature value. {\textbar} Each feature value may have a different importance for each developmental disorder for which the assessment procedure is designed to screen. Accordingly, the importance of each feature value may be represented as a probability distribution that describes the probability of the feature value yielding an accurate prediction for each of the plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders being evaluated. {\textbar}   {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1010 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module can determine the probability of a subject providing each feature value. The probability that the subject may provide a specific feature value can be computed using any appropriate statistical model. For example, a large probabilistic graphical model can be used to find the values of expressions such as: {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1) {\textbar} where A, B, and C represent different features or questions in the prediction module and the integers 1 and 2 represent different possible feature values for the feature (or possible answers to the questions). The probability of a subject providing a specific feature value may then be computed using Bayes' rule, with expressions such as: {\textbar}   {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)=prob( {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)/prob( {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1) {\textbar} Such expressions may be computationally expensive, in terms of both computation time and required processing resources. Alternatively or in combination with computing the probabilities explicitly using Bayes' rule, logistic regression or other statistical estimators may be used, wherein the probability is estimated using parameters derived from a machine learning algorithm. For example, the following expression may be used to estimate the probability that the subject may provide a specific feature value: {\textbar}   {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)≈sigmoid( {\textbar} a {\textbar} 1* {\textbar} A+a {\textbar} 2* {\textbar} B+a {\textbar} 3* {\textbar} C+a {\textbar} 4), {\textbar} wherein a1, a2, a3, and a4 are constant coefficients determined from the trained assessment model, learned using an optimization algorithm that attempts to make this expression maximally correct, and wherein sigmoid is a nonlinear function that enables this expression to be turned into a probability. Such an algorithm can be quick to train, and the resulting expressions can be computed quickly in application, e.g., during administration of the assessment procedure. Although reference is made to four coefficients, as many coefficients as are helpful may be used as will be recognized by a person of ordinary skill in the art. {\textbar}   {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1015 {\textbar} , the expected importance of each feature value can be determined based on a combination of the metrics calculated in steps  {\textbar} 1005 {\textbar}  and  {\textbar} 1010 {\textbar} . Based on these two factors, the feature recommendation module can determine the expected utility of the specific feature value in predicting a specific developmental disorder. Although reference is made herein to the determination of expected importance via multiplication, the expected importance can be determined by combining coefficients and parameters in many ways, such as with look up tables, logic, or division, for example. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1020 {\textbar} , steps  {\textbar} 1005 {\textbar} - {\textbar} 1015 {\textbar}  can be repeated for every possible feature value for each candidate feature. For example, if a particular question has 4 possible answers, the expected importance of each of the 4 possible answers is determined. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1025 {\textbar} , the total expected importance, or the expected feature importance, of each candidate feature can be determined. The expected feature importance of each feature can be determined by summing the feature value importances of every possible feature value for the feature, as determined in step  {\textbar} 1020 {\textbar} . By thus summing the expected utilities across all possible feature values for a given feature, the feature recommendation module can determine the total expected feature importance of the feature for predicting a specific developmental disorder in response to previous answers. {\textbar} At step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1030 {\textbar} , steps  {\textbar} 1005 {\textbar} - {\textbar} 1025 {\textbar}  can be repeated for every candidate feature being considered by the feature recommendation module. The candidate features may comprise a subset of possible features such as questions. Thus, an expected feature importance score for every candidate feature can be generated, and the candidate features can be ranked in order of highest to lowest expected feature importance. {\textbar} Optionally, in addition to the two factors determined in steps  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1005 {\textbar}  and  {\textbar} 1010 {\textbar} , a third factor may also be taken into account in determining the importance of each feature value. Based on the subject's previously provided feature values, the subject's probability of having one or more of the plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders can be determined. Such a probability can be determined based on the probability distribution stored in the assessment model, indicating the probability of the subject having each of the plurality of screened behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders based on the feature values provided by the subject. In selecting the next feature to be presented to the subject, the algorithm may be configured to give greater weight to the feature values most important or relevant to predicting the one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders that the subject at hand is most likely to have. For example, if a subject's previously provided feature values indicate that the subject has a higher probability of having either an intellectual disability or speech and language delay than any of the other behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders being evaluated, the feature recommendation module can favor feature values having high importance for predicting either intellectual disability or speech and language delay, rather than features having high importance for predicting autism, ADHD, or any other developmental disorder that the assessment is designed to screen for. The feature recommendation module can thus enable the prediction module to tailor the prediction process to the subject at hand, presenting more features that are relevant to the subject's potential developmental disorder to yield a final classification with higher granularity and confidence. {\textbar} Although the above steps show an exemplary operational flow  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1000 {\textbar}  of an expected feature importance determination algorithm  {\textbar} 627 {\textbar} , a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations based on the teachings described herein. The steps may be completed in a different order. Steps may be added or deleted. Some of the steps may comprise sub-steps of other steps. Many of the steps may be repeated as often as desired by the user. {\textbar} An exemplary implementation of the feature recommendation module is now described. Subject X has provided answers (feature values) to questions (features) A, B, and C in the assessment procedure: {\textbar}   {\textbar} Subject  {\textbar}   {\textbar} X=\{‘A’: {\textbar} 1,‘ {\textbar} B’: {\textbar} 2,‘ {\textbar} C’: {\textbar} 1\} {\textbar} The feature recommendation module can determine whether question D or question E should be presented next in order to maximally increase the predictive confidence with which a final classification or diagnosis can be reached. Given Subject X's previous answers, the feature recommendation module determines the probability of Subject X providing each possible answer to each of questions D and E, as follows: {\textbar}   {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)=0.1 {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 2{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)=0.9 {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} D= {\textbar} 1{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)=0.7 {\textbar} prob( {\textbar}   {\textbar} D= {\textbar} 2{\textbar} {\textbar} A= {\textbar} 1, {\textbar} B= {\textbar} 2, {\textbar} C= {\textbar} 1)=0.3 {\textbar} The feature importance of each possible answer to each of questions D and E can be computed based on the assessment model as described. Alternatively, the feature importance of each possible answer to each of questions D and E can be computed as the actual prediction confidence that would result if the subject were to give the specific answer. The importance of each answer can be represented using a range of values on any appropriate numerical scale. For example: {\textbar}   {\textbar} importance( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 1)=1 {\textbar} importance( {\textbar}   {\textbar} E= {\textbar} 2)=3 {\textbar} importance( {\textbar}   {\textbar} D= {\textbar} 1)=2 {\textbar} importance( {\textbar}   {\textbar} D= {\textbar} 2)=4 {\textbar} Based on the computed probabilities and the feature value importances, the feature recommendation module can compute the expected feature importance of each question as follows: {\textbar}   {\textbar} Expectation {\textbar}   {\textbar}  {\textbar} [ {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} E {\textbar} ) {\textbar} ] {\textbar} = {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} prob {\textbar} ( {\textbar} E {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} {\textbar} {\textbar} A {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} , {\textbar}  {\textbar} B {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} , {\textbar} C {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} * {\textbar}  {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} E {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} + {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} prob {\textbar} ( {\textbar} E {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} {\textbar} {\textbar} A {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} , {\textbar}  {\textbar} B {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} , {\textbar} C {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} * {\textbar}  {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} E {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} = {\textbar}  {\textbar} 0.1 {\textbar} * {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} + {\textbar} 0.9 {\textbar} * {\textbar} 3 {\textbar} = {\textbar}  {\textbar} 2.8 {\textbar} Expectation {\textbar}  {\textbar} [ {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} D {\textbar} ) {\textbar} ] {\textbar} = {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} prob {\textbar} ( {\textbar} D {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} {\textbar} {\textbar} A {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} , {\textbar}  {\textbar} B {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} , {\textbar} C {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} * {\textbar}  {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} D {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} + {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} prob {\textbar} ( {\textbar} D {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} {\textbar} {\textbar} A {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} , {\textbar}  {\textbar} B {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} , {\textbar} C {\textbar} = {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} * {\textbar}  {\textbar} importance {\textbar}  {\textbar} ( {\textbar} D {\textbar} = {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} ) {\textbar} = {\textbar}  {\textbar} 0.7 {\textbar} * {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} + {\textbar} 0.3 {\textbar} * {\textbar} 4 {\textbar} Hence, the expected feature importance (also referred to as relevance) from the answer of question E is determined to be higher than that of question D, even though question D has generally higher feature importances for its answers. The feature recommendation module can therefore select question E as the next question to be presented to Subject X. {\textbar}   {\textbar} When selecting the next best feature to be presented to a subject, the feature recommendation module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 625 {\textbar}  may be further configured to exclude one or more candidate features from consideration, if the candidate features have a high co-variance with a feature that has already been presented to the subject. The co-variance of different features may be determined based on the training data, and may be stored in the assessment model constructed by the training module. If a candidate feature has a high co-variance with a previously presented feature, the candidate feature may add relatively little additional predictive utility, and may hence be omitted from future presentation to the subject in order to optimize the efficiency of the assessment procedure. {\textbar} The prediction module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 620 {\textbar}  may interact with the person participating in the assessment procedure (e.g., a subject or the subject's caretaker) with a user interface  {\textbar} 630 {\textbar} . The user interface may be provided with a user interface, such as a display of any computing device that can enable the user to access the prediction module, such as a personal computer, a tablet, or a smartphone. The computing device may comprise a processor that comprises instructions for providing the user interface, for example in the form of a mobile application. The user interface can be configured to display instructions from the prediction module to the user, and/or receive input from the user with an input method provided by the computing device. Thus, the user can participate in the assessment procedure as described herein by interacting with the prediction module with the user interface, for example by providing answers (feature values) in response to questions (features) presented by the prediction module. The user interface may be configured to administer the assessment procedure in real-time, such that the user answers one question at a time and the prediction module can select the next best question to ask based on recommendations made by the feature recommendation module. Alternatively or in combination, the user interface may be configured to receive a complete set of new data from a user, for example by allowing a user to upload a complete set of feature values corresponding to a set of features. {\textbar} As described herein, the features of interest relevant to identifying one or more behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders may be evaluated in a subject in many ways. For example, the subject or caretaker or clinician may be asked a series of questions designed to assess the extent to which the features of interest are present in the subject. The answers provided can then represent the corresponding feature values of the subject. The user interface may be configured to present a series of questions to the subject (or any person participating in the assessment procedure on behalf of the subject), which may be dynamically selected from a set of candidate questions as described herein. Such a question-and-answer based assessment procedure can be administered entirely by a machine, and can hence provide a very quick prediction of the subject's developmental disorder(s). {\textbar}   {\textbar} Alternatively or in combination, features of interest in a subject may be evaluated with observation of the subject's behaviors, for example with videos of the subject. The user interface may be configured to allow a subject or the subject's caretaker to record or upload one or more videos of the subject. The video footage may be subsequently analyzed by qualified personnel to determine the subject's feature values for features of interest. Alternatively or in combination, video analysis for the determination of feature values may be performed by a machine. For example, the video analysis may comprise detecting objects (e.g., subject, subject's spatial position, face, eyes, mouth, hands, limbs, fingers, toes, feet, etc.), followed by tracking the movement of the objects. The video analysis may infer the gender of the subject, and/or the proficiency of spoken language(s) of the subject. The video analysis may identify faces globally, or specific landmarks on the face such as the nose, eyes, lips and mouth to infer facial expressions and track these expressions over time. The video analysis may detect eyes, limbs, fingers, toes, hands, feet, and track their movements over time to infer behaviors. In some cases, the analysis may further infer the intention of the behaviors, for example, a child being upset by noise or loud music, engaging in self-harming behaviors, imitating another person's actions, etc. The sounds and/or voices recorded in the video files may also be analyzed. The analysis may infer a context of the subject's behavior. The sound/voice analysis may infer a feeling of the subject. The analysis of a video of a subject, performed by a human and/or by a machine, can yield feature values for the features of interest, which can then be encoded appropriately for input into the prediction module. A prediction of the subject's developmental disorder may then be generated based on a fitting of the subject's feature values to the assessment model constructed using training data. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Alternatively or in combination, features of interest in a subject may be evaluated through structured interactions with the subject. For example, the subject may be asked to play a game such as a computer game, and the performance of the subject on the game may be used to evaluate one or more features of the subject. The subject may be presented with one or more stimuli (e.g., visual stimuli presented to the subject via a display), and the response of the subject to the stimuli may be used to evaluate the subject's features. The subject may be asked to perform a certain task (e.g., subject may be asked to pop bubbles with his or her fingers), and the response of the subject to the request or the ability of the subject to carry out the requested task may be used to evaluate to the subject's features. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The methods and apparatus described herein can be configured in many ways to determine the next most predictive or relevant question. At least a portion of the software instructions as described herein can be configured to run locally on a local device so as to provide the user interface and present questions and receive answers to the questions. The local device can be configured with software instructions of an application program interface (API) to query a remote server for the most predictive next question. The API can return an identified question based on the feature importance as described herein, for example. Alternatively or in combination, the local processor can be configured with instructions to determine the most predictive next question in response to previous answers. For example, the prediction module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 620 {\textbar}  may comprise software instructions of a remote server, or software instructions of a local processor, and combinations thereof. Alternatively or in combination, the feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar}  may comprise software instructions of a remote server, or software instructions of a local processor, and combinations thereof, configured to determine the most predictive next question, for example. The exemplary operational flow  {\textbar} 1000 {\textbar}  of method of determining an expected feature importance determination algorithm  {\textbar} 627 {\textbar}  as performed by a feature recommendation module  {\textbar} 625 {\textbar}  described herein can be performed with one or more processors as described herein, for example. {\textbar} FIG. 11 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates a method  {\textbar} 1100 {\textbar}  of administering an assessment procedure as described herein. The method  {\textbar} 1100 {\textbar}  may be performed with a user interface provided on a computing device, the computing device comprising a display and a user interface for receiving user input in response to the instructions provided on the display. The user participating in the assessment procedure may be the subject himself, or another person participating in the procedure on behalf of the subject, such as the subject's caretaker. At step  {\textbar} 1105 {\textbar} , an N {\textbar} th  {\textbar} question related an N {\textbar} th  {\textbar} feature can be presented to the user with the display. At step  {\textbar} 1110 {\textbar} , the subject's answer containing the corresponding N {\textbar} th  {\textbar} feature value can be received. At step  {\textbar} 1115 {\textbar} , the dataset for the subject at hand can be updated to include N {\textbar} th  {\textbar} the feature value provided for the subject. At step  {\textbar} 1120 {\textbar} , the updated dataset can be fitted to an assessment model to generate a predicted classification. Step  {\textbar} 1120 {\textbar}  may be performed by a prediction module, as described herein. At step  {\textbar} 1125 {\textbar} , a check can be performed to determine whether the fitting of the data can generate a prediction of a specific developmental disorder (e.g., autism, ADHD, etc.) sufficient confidence (e.g., within at least a 90\% confidence interval). If so, as shown at step  {\textbar} 1130 {\textbar} , the predicted developmental disorder can be displayed to the user. If not, in step  {\textbar} 1135 {\textbar} , a check can be performed to determine whether there are any additional features that can be queried. If yes, as shown at step  {\textbar} 1140 {\textbar} , the feature recommendation module may select the next feature to be presented to the user, and steps  {\textbar} 1105 {\textbar} - {\textbar} 1125 {\textbar}  may be repeated until a final prediction (e.g., a specific developmental disorder or “no diagnosis”) can be displayed to the subject. If no additional features can be presented to the subject, “no diagnosis” may be displayed to the subject, as shown at step  {\textbar} 1145 {\textbar} . {\textbar} Although the above steps show an exemplary a method  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1100 {\textbar}  of administering an assessment procedure, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations based on the teachings described herein. The steps may be completed in a different order. Steps may be added or deleted. Some of the steps may comprise sub-steps of other steps. Many of the steps may be repeated as often as desired by the user. {\textbar} The present disclosure provides computer control systems that are programmed to implement methods of the disclosure.  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 12 {\textbar}  shows a computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  suitable for incorporation with the methods and apparatus described herein. The computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can process various aspects of information of the present disclosure, such as, for example, questions and answers, responses, statistical analyses. The computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can be an electronic device of a user or a computer system that is remotely located with respect to the electronic device. The electronic device can be a mobile electronic device. {\textbar} The computer system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  includes a central processing unit (CPU, also “processor” and “computer processor” herein)  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar} , which can be a single core or multi core processor, or a plurality of processors for parallel processing. The computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  also includes memory or memory location  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar}  (e.g., random-access memory, read-only memory, flash memory), electronic storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  (e.g., hard disk), communication interface  {\textbar} 1220 {\textbar}  (e.g., network adapter) for communicating with one or more other systems, and peripheral devices  {\textbar} 1225 {\textbar} , such as cache, other memory, data storage and/or electronic display adapters. The memory  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar} , storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar} , interface  {\textbar} 1220 {\textbar}  and peripheral devices  {\textbar} 1225 {\textbar}  are in communication with the CPU  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar}  through a communication bus (solid lines), such as a motherboard. The storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  can be a data storage unit (or data repository) for storing data. The computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can be operatively coupled to a computer network (“network”)  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar}  with the aid of the communication interface  {\textbar} 1220 {\textbar} . The network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar}  can be the Internet, an internet and/or extranet, or an intranet and/or extranet that is in communication with the Internet. The network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar}  in some cases is a telecommunication and/or data network. The network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar}  can include one or more computer servers, which can enable distributed computing, such as cloud computing. The network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar} , in some cases with the aid of the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar} , can implement a peer-to-peer network, which may enable devices coupled to the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  to behave as a client or a server. {\textbar} The CPU  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar}  can execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, which can be embodied in a program or software. The instructions may be stored in a memory location, such as the memory  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar} . The instructions can be directed to the CPU  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar} , which can subsequently program or otherwise configure the CPU  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar}  to implement methods of the present disclosure. Examples of operations performed by the CPU  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar}  can include fetch, decode, execute, and writeback. {\textbar} The CPU  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar}  can be part of a circuit, such as an integrated circuit. One or more other components of the system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can be included in the circuit. In some cases, the circuit is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). {\textbar} The storage unit  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  can store files, such as drivers, libraries and saved programs. The storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  can store user data, e.g., user preferences and user programs. The computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  in some cases can include one or more additional data storage units that are external to the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar} , such as located on a remote server that is in communication with the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  through an intranet or the Internet. {\textbar} The computer system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can communicate with one or more remote computer systems through the network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar} . For instance, the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can communicate with a remote computer system of a user (e.g., a parent). Examples of remote computer systems and mobile communication devices include personal computers (e.g., portable PC), slate or tablet PC's (e.g., Apple® iPad, Samsung® Galaxy Tab), telephones, Smart phones (e.g., Apple® iPhone, Android-enabled device, Blackberry®), personal digital assistants, wearable medical devices (e.g., Fitbits), or medical device monitors (e.g., seizure monitors). The user can access the computer system  {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  with the network  {\textbar} 1230 {\textbar} . {\textbar} Methods as described herein can be implemented by way of machine (e.g., computer processor) executable code stored on an electronic storage location of the computer system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar} , such as, for example, on the memory  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar}  or electronic storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar} . The machine executable or machine readable code can be provided in the form of software. During use, the code can be executed by the processor  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar} . In some cases, the code can be retrieved from the storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  and stored on the memory  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar}  for ready access by the processor  {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar} . In some situations, the electronic storage unit  {\textbar} 1215 {\textbar}  can be precluded, and machine-executable instructions are stored on memory  {\textbar} 1210 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The code can be pre-compiled and configured for use with a machine have a processer adapted to execute the code, or can be compiled during runtime. The code can be supplied in a programming language that can be selected to enable the code to execute in a pre-compiled or as-compiled fashion. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Aspects of the systems and methods provided herein, such as the computer system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 401 {\textbar} , can be embodied in programming. Various aspects of the technology may be thought of as “products” or “articles of manufacture” typically in the form of machine (or processor) executable code and/or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Machine-executable code can be stored on an electronic storage unit, such memory (e.g., read-only memory, random-access memory, flash memory) or a hard disk. “Storage” type media can include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers, processors or the like, or associated modules thereof, such as various semiconductor memories, tape drives, disk drives and the like, which may provide non-transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications, for example, may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another, for example, from a management server or host computer into the computer platform of an application server. Thus, another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical, electrical and electromagnetic waves, such as used across physical interfaces between local devices, through wired and optical landline networks and over various air-links. The physical elements that carry such waves, such as wired or wireless links, optical links or the like, also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein, unless restricted to non-transitory, tangible “storage” media, terms such as computer or machine “readable medium” refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution. {\textbar} Hence, a machine readable medium, such as computer-executable code, may take many forms, including but not limited to, a tangible storage medium, a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non-volatile storage media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any computer(s) or the like, such as may be used to implement the databases, etc. shown in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables; copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier-wave transmission media may take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media therefore include for example: a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards paper tape, any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a ROM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or links transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer may read programming code and/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The computer system  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1201 {\textbar}  can include or be in communication with an electronic display  {\textbar} 1235 {\textbar}  that comprises a user interface (UI)  {\textbar} 1240 {\textbar}  for providing, for example, questions and answers, analysis results, recommendations. Examples of UI's include, without limitation, a graphical user interface (GUI) and web-based user interface. {\textbar} Methods and systems of the present disclosure can be implemented by way of one or more algorithms and with instructions provided with one or more processors as disclosed herein. An algorithm can be implemented by way of software upon execution by the central processing unit  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 1205 {\textbar} . The algorithm can be, for example, random forest, graphical models, support vector machine or other. {\textbar} Although the above steps show a method of a system in accordance with an example, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations based on the teaching described herein. The steps may be completed in a different order. Steps may be added or deleted. Some of the steps may comprise sub-steps. Many of the steps may be repeated as often as if beneficial to the platform. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Each of the examples as described herein can be combined with one or more other examples. Further, one or more components of one or more examples can be combined with other examples. {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 13 {\textbar}   {\textbar}  illustrates an exemplary system diagram for a digital personalized medicine platform  {\textbar} 1300 {\textbar}  with a feedback loop and reduced tests. The platform  {\textbar} 1300 {\textbar}  can provide diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cognitive and behavioral conditions associated with developmental delays, for example. A user digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , for example a mobile device such as a smart phone, an activity monitors, or a wearable digital monitor, can records data and metadata related to a patient. Data may be collected based on interactions of the patient with the device, as well as based on interactions with caregivers and health care professionals, as discussed hereinabove. {\textbar} The digital device  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 110 {\textbar}  can communicate with a personalized medical system  {\textbar} 130 {\textbar}  over a communication network  {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} . The personalized medical system  {\textbar} 130 {\textbar}  can comprises a diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  to provide initial and updated diagnosis of a patient's developmental status, and a therapeutic module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  to provide personalized therapy recommendations in response to the diagnoses of diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In some instances, the diagnosis module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  can comprise data processing module as described herein. The data processing module can enable the diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  to provide an assessment on the subject with reduced number of test questions. The data processing module can comprise a preprocessing module, a training module and a prediction module as described herein. The data processing module can extract training data from a database or a user, apply one or more transformations to standardize the training data and pass the standardized training data to the training module. The training module can utilize a machine learning algorithm or other algorithm to construct and train an assessment model to be used in the diagnostic tests, based on the standardized training data. Once an assessment model is derived from the training data, the model may be used as a prediction tool to assess the risk of a subject for cognitive function such as developmental advancement, or one or more disorders such as behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders. The training data can comprise data developed on a population where the subject patient is not a member of the population. The prediction module can be configured to generate a predicted classification of cognitive function (e.g., developmental disorder) of a given subject, by fitting new data to an assessment model constructed in the training module. The data processing module can identify a most predictive next question based on a plurality of answers to a plurality of asked questions, as discussed herein, such that a person can be diagnosed or identified as at risk and treated with fewer questions. {\textbar} Diagnostic tests (for example, a set of tests and questions) as generated from the diagnosis module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  can be provided to the patient or caregiver via the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} . The patient's answers to the diagnostic tests can be received by the diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} . The diagnosis module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  can generate an initial diagnosis based on the patient's answers. For example, the diagnostic module may diagnose autism-related speech delay based on questions asked to the caregiver and tests administered to the patient such as vocabulary or verbal communication tests. {\textbar} The diagnosis module can communicate its initial diagnosis to the therapy module  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} , which uses the initial diagnosis to suggest initial therapies to be performed to treat any diagnosed symptoms. The therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  sends its recommended therapies to the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} , including instructions for the patient and caregivers to perform the therapies recommended over a given time frame. The patient and caregivers can provide feedback to the diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} , and the diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  can then instruct the data processing module to provide new diagnostic tests and questions to the digital device  {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} . The diagnostic module  {\textbar} 132 {\textbar}  then provides an updated diagnosis to the therapy module  {\textbar} 134 {\textbar}  which suggests updated therapies to be performed by the patient and caregivers as a next step of therapy. Therefore, a feedback loop between the patient and caregivers, the diagnostic module and the therapy module can be formed, and the patient can be diagnosed with fewer questions. The feedback can identify relative levels of efficacy, compliance and responses resulting from the therapeutic interventions, and allow corrective changes to improve treatment. {\textbar} In some instances, the therapy module may rely on the diagnostic module in order to classify subjects as having different conditions or different severity levels of a condition. Optionally, the therapy module can have its own independent prediction module or recommendation module in order to decide on next best therapy or treatment from a list of options. This decision can take into account the assessment from the diagnostic module, as well as independently compiled statistics relating to the historical probability for certain patients to respond to certain treatments, broken down by demographics like gender/age/race/etc. The therapy module can perform the predictive task using simple rules or sophisticated machine learning techniques. In the case of machine learning, an independent feedback loop would take place, connecting patient treatment outcome back to the therapy module. {\textbar}   {\textbar} In some instances, a third-party system, such as a computer system of a health care professional, can be connected to the communication network  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} . The health care professional or other third party can be alerted to significant deviations from the diagnosis provided by the diagnostic module and/or therapies suggested by the therapy module based on the reduced number of questions. Appropriate further action can then be taken by the third party. For example, third-party system can review and modify therapies suggested by the therapy module. {\textbar} In some instances, the patient can have response profiles in response to the therapies, and the therapy module can be configured to categorize the response profiles based on an initial response of the subject. For example, the subject could have a response profile that indicates the treatment is working or a response profile indicating that treatment is not working. These initial response profiles can be somewhat counter intuitive. For example, a fluctuation in symptoms could be an indicator that the treatment is working even though these fluctuations could include an increase and a decrease in a symptom relative to baseline. For some treatments, the time at which there's a change in symptoms could be delayed. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The user, such as the patient and caregivers, can for example download and install an App comprising software instructions on the digital device  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} . The App can enable the user to receive instructions from the cloud-based server for the diagnostic tests, upload the answers to diagnostic tests, receive a treatment (for example, games or interactive content) from the cloud-based server, offer feedback, periodically receive new tests to determine how the treatment is progressing, and receive updated treatment. The app can be installed on a plurality of digital devices, such as a first device for the subject to receive digital therapy and second device for the caregiver to monitor progress of the therapy. A feedback loop is thus created between the user and the cloud-based server (for example, the personalized medicine system  {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} ), in which the evaluation of the subject subsequent to the initiation of therapy is used to adjust therapy to improve the response. {\textbar} Experimental Data {\textbar}   {\textbar} A data processing module as described herein was built on Python 2.7, Anaconda Distribution. The training data used to construct and train the assessment model included data generated by the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), which performed in-home assessments to collect ADI-R and ADOS data from parents and children in their homes. ADI-R comprises a parent interview presenting a total of 93 questions, and yields a diagnosis of autism or no autism. ADOS comprises a semi-structured interview of a child that yields a diagnosis of autism, ASD, or no diagnosis, wherein a child is administered one of four possible modules based on language level, each module comprising about 30 questions. The data included clinical diagnoses of the children derived from the assessments; if a single child had discrepant ADI-R versus ADOS diagnoses, a licensed clinical psychologist assigned a consensus diagnosis for the dataset for the child in question. The training data included a total of 3,449 data points, with 3,315 cases (autism or ASD) and 134 controls (non-spectrum). The features evaluated in the training data targeted 3 key domains: language, social communication, and repetitive behaviors. {\textbar}   {\textbar} A boosted Random Forest classifier was used to build the assessment model as described herein. Prior to training the assessment model on the training data, the training data was pre-processed to standardize the data, and re-encode categorical features in a one-hot representation as described herein. Since the training data was skewed towards individuals with autism or ASD, sample weighting was applied to attribute up to 50 times higher significance to data from non-spectrum individuals compared to data from autistic/ASD individuals. The assessment model was trained iteratively with boosting, updating the weighting of data points after each iteration to increase the significance attributed to data points that were misclassified, and retraining with the updated significances. {\textbar}   {\textbar} The trained model was validated using Stratified k-fold cross validation with k=5. The cross-validation yielded an accuracy of about 93-96\%, wherein the accuracy is defined as the percentage of subjects correctly classified using the model in a binary classification task (autism/non-spectrum). Since the training data contained a sample bias, a confusion matrix was calculated to determine how often the model confused one class (autism or non-spectrum) with another. The percentage of correctly classified autism individuals was about 95\%, while the percentage of correctly classified non-spectrum individuals was about 76\%. It should be noted, however, that the model may be adjusted to more closely fit one class versus another, in which case the percentage of correct classifications for each class can change.  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIG. 14 {\textbar}  shows receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves mapping sensitivity versus fall-out for an exemplary assessment model as described herein. The true positive rate (sensitivity) for the diagnosis of autism is mapped on the y-axis, as a function of the false positive rate (fall-out) for diagnosis mapped on the x-axis. Each of the three curves, labeled “Fold \#0”, “Fold \#1”, and “Fold \#2”, corresponds to a different “fold” of the cross-validation procedure, wherein for each fold, a portion of the training data was fitted to the assessment model while varying the prediction confidence threshold necessary to classify a dataset as “autistic”. As desired or appropriate, the model may be adjusted to increase the sensitivity in exchange for some increase in fall-out, or to decrease the sensitivity in return for a decrease in fall-out, as according to the ROC curves of the model. {\textbar} The feature recommendation module was configured as described herein, wherein the expected feature importance of each question was computed, and candidate questions ranked in order of computed importance with calls to a server with an application program interface (API). The feature recommendation module's ability to recommend informative questions was evaluated by determining the correlation between a question's recommendation score with the increase in prediction accuracy gained from answering the recommended question. The following steps were performed to compute the correlation metric: (1) the data was split up into folds for cross-validation; (2) already answered questions were randomly removed from the validation set; (3) expected feature importance (question recommendation/score) was generated for each question; (4) one of the questions removed in step  {\textbar}   {\textbar} 2 {\textbar}  was revealed, and the relative improvement in the subsequent prediction accuracy was measured; and (5) the correlation between the relative improvement and the expected feature importance was computed. The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient ranged between 0.2 and 0.3, indicating a moderate degree of correlation between the expected feature importance score and the relative improvement.  {\textbar} FIG. 15 {\textbar}  is a scatter plot showing the correlation between the expected feature importance (“Expected Informativitiy Score”) and the relative improvement (“Relative Classification Improvement”) for each question. The plot shows a moderate linear relationship between the two variables, demonstrating the feature recommendation module is indeed able to recommend questions that would increase the prediction accuracy. {\textbar} The length of time to produce an output using the developed prediction module and the feature recommendation model was measured. The prediction module took about 46 ms to make a prediction of an individual's risk of autism. The feature recommendation module took about 41 ms to generation question recommendations for an individual. Although these measurements were made with calls to a server through an API, the computations can be performed locally, for example. {\textbar}   {\textbar} While the assessment model of the data processing module described with respect to  {\textbar}   {\textbar} FIGS. 9-10 {\textbar}  was constructed and trained to classify subjects as having autism or no autism, a similar approach may be used to build an assessment model that can classify a subject as having one or more of a plurality of behavioral, neurological or mental health disorders, as described herein. {\textbar} A person of ordinary skill in the art can generate and obtain additional datasets and improve the sensitivity and specificity and confidence interval of the methods and apparatus disclosed herein to obtain improved results without undue experimentation. Although these measurements were performed with example datasets, the methods and apparatus can be configured with additional datasets as described herein and the subject identified as at risk with a confidence interval of 80\% in a clinical environment without undue experimentation. The sensitivity and specificity of 80\% or more in a clinical environment can be similarly obtained with the teachings provided herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation, for example with additional datasets. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Additional datasets may be obtained from large archival data repositories as described herein, such as the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), Boston Autism Consortium (AC), Simons Foundation, National Database for Autism Research, and the like. Alternatively or in combination, additional datasets may comprise mathematically simulated data, generated based on archival data using various simulation algorithms. Alternatively or in combination, additional datasets may be obtained via crowd-sourcing, wherein subjects self-administer the assessment procedure as described herein and contribute data from their assessment. In addition to data from the self-administered assessment, subjects may also provide a clinical diagnosis obtained from a qualified clinician, so as to provide a standard of comparison for the assessment procedure. {\textbar}   {\textbar} Although the detailed description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure but merely as illustrating different examples and aspects of the present disclosure. It should be appreciated that the scope of the disclosure includes other embodiments not discussed in detail above. Various other modifications, changes and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement, operation and details of the method and apparatus of the present disclosure provided herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described herein. For example, one or more aspects, components or methods of each of the examples as disclosed herein can be combined with others as described herein, and such modifications will be readily apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a standard for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in the United States. It provides a symptom-based taxonomy which serves to help clinicians classify various clusters of symptoms and abnormal behaviors into distinct categories of disorders. {\textbar} {\textbar} However, categorizing mental disorders as discrete entities each having its own distinct cluster of symptoms has its inadequacies. This approach hampers prognostic assessment, treatment, and drug development. Therefore, one objective of the present disclosure is to use a data-driven method to find highly-predictive biomarkers for several measures of depressed mood, anxiety, anhedonia and related negative symptoms. {\textbar} {\textbar} SUMMARY {\textbar} {\textbar} Aspects of the present disclosure include a system for evaluating a patient for mental health issues. The system includes a display device, a user interface, a memory, and a control system. The memory contains machine readable medium. The machine readable medium includes machine executable code storing instructions for performing a method. The control system is coupled to the memory, and includes one or more processors. The control system is configured to execute the machine executable code to cause the control system to perform the method: On the display device, a series of questions from mental health questionnaires is displayed. The series of questions includes text and answers for each question. From the user interface, a selection of answers of each of the series of questions is received from a patient. Unprocessed MRI data are received. The unprocessed MRI data correspond to a set of MRI images of a biological structure associated with the patient. Using a machine learning model, the selection of answers and the unprocessed MRI data are processed to output a mental health indication of the patient. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some aspects, the unprocessed MRI data corresponds to MRI data for a brain of the patient. In some aspects, the unprocessed MRI data includes at least one of: functional MRI data, resting-state functional MRI data, structural MRI data, and any combination thereof. In some aspects, the control system is further configured to preprocess the unprocessed MRI data to identify a plurality of features. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some aspects, the mental health indication is categorical. For example, the mental health indication includes a determination that the processed selection of answers and the processed MRI data includes indications of at least one of: a neuropsychiatric disorder, schizophrenia, a bi-polar disorder, and any combination thereof. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some aspects, outputting the mental health indication further comprises determining that the processed selection of answers and the processed MRI data identifies features corresponding to a mental disorder. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some aspects, the machine learning model is at least one of a generalized linear model, a regression model, a logistical regression model, a supervised regression method, random forest, LASSO, a supervised machine-learning model, and an elastic net. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some aspects, the machine learning model was generated by receiving labeled training data for a plurality of individuals. The labeled training data indicates whether each of the plurality of individuals has one or more mental health disorders. The labeled training data includes MRI data recorded for each of the plurality of individuals. The labeled training data further includes a selection of answers to the series of questions for each of the plurality of individuals.

Yet, evidence has long suggested that symptoms in psychiatric disorders do not follow boundaries between DSM categories, implicating an underlying latent transdiagnostic dimensional structure. While abnormal feature dimensions associated with the latent symptom dimensions can be identified within a single DSM category, the transdiagnostic dimensional structure shared across psychiatric disorders largely remains unknown. {\textbar} {\textbar} Thus, the field of psychiatry can rely on making diagnoses and recommending treatment for disorders based solely on clinical phenomenology. However, this approach hampers prognostic assessment, treatment, and drug development. As with many other areas of medicine, defining mental illness based on a combination of symptoms and biological underpinnings could allow for a richer understanding and potentially better management of these disorders. {\textbar} {\textbar} Moreover, dimensionality and comorbidity are pervasive in terms of symptoms across different DSM categories. Such dimensionality is manifested as heterogeneity in symptom clusters within disease categories defined by the DSM as well as overlaps across DSM categories. For instance, in the area of anxiety and mood disorders, more than 50\% of individuals are diagnosed of having more than one category of disorders according to the DSM at a given time. Similarly, about 50\% of bipolar disorder patients exhibit schizophrenic-like psychotic symptoms during illness episodes. The presence of such psychotic symptoms can be mood-incongruent and can occur outside of illness episodes, hence creating challenges in correctly categorizing and treating such patients. Overall, a latent trans-diagnostic dimensional structure may exist spanning multiple disorders. The DSM's symptom-based taxonomy may not provide an accurate account of such latent structure of psychopathology. {\textbar} {\textbar} Furthermore, clinical symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, and anhedonia span multiple diagnostic categories, so one approach to linking them with their biological bases would be examination of symptom severity trans-diagnostically at suitable physiological levels. This approach of stratifying mental disorders by symptom dimension across current diagnostic categories could sidestep the main issue that categorical boundaries present. Evidence suggests symptom dimensions that span multiple psychiatric disorders and can be tied to biological bases. {\textbar} {\textbar} This issue may be addressed by identifying the underlying structures of psychopathology on multiple levels including symptom, behavior, physiology, imaging, and genetics. Data-driven methods based on symptom and behavior have largely focused on classifying and subtyping patients within a single diagnostic category. While such a focus on re-partitioning a single diagnostic category is useful, it is likely to be limited given the observed symptom overlaps across DSM categories. On the other hand, genetic risk for psychiatric disorders is pleiotropic and shared across broad dimensions of disorders, such as SCZ, BD, and ADHD. Yet, the genetic risk identified for psychiatric disorder is generally characterized by polygenic inheritance, hence the effect size from a given risk allele is likely to be small. Based on neuroimaging (e.g., sMRI), shared abnormalities in certain brain regions underlying common psychiatric disorders were identified. Functional MRI (fMRI) found altered functional connectivity patterns shared across multiple categories of disorders such as SCZ, BD, and MDD. {\textbar} {\textbar} Though valuable, the search for psychiatric biomarkers has thus largely been limited to those that permit diagnostic classification and generally limited to one type, mode, or category of biomarker. Certain clinical phenotypes described at the symptom or neurobiological levels may span multiple diagnoses. Therefore, exploration of transdiagnostic biomarkers that probe these levels of expression could expand our understanding beyond categorical definitions of disorders and towards disorders that vary along symptom dimensions. {\textbar} {\textbar} Therefore, the present disclosure contemplates that there exist distinct subtypes within various mental health disorders (e.g., MDD, PTSD, and panic disorder) based on, for example, orthogonal symptom dimensions shared across the DSM diagnoses and their corresponding biomarkers. The corresponding biomarkers can include biomarkers identifiable in neuroimaging as discussed further herein and other modalities (including advantageously combining modalities). While these important shared abnormal features associated with the latent transdiagnostic symptom and behavior dimensions can be identified, the robustness of the identified features in terms of their ability to reliably classify patients according to the symptom and behavior dimensions are tested and discussed herein. {\textbar} {\textbar} According to some implementations of the present disclosure, using the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (“CNP”) dataset, a set of phenotypic features shared across schizophrenia (“SCZ”), bipolar disorder (“BD”), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) from self-reported clinical instruments is identified. For example, the set of phenotypic features are identified according to four (4) transdiagnostic classifiers: (1) Healthy vs. All Patients, (2) Healthy vs. SCZ \& BD, (3) Healthy vs. SCZ \& ADHD, and (4) Healthy vs. BD \& ADHD. {\textbar} {\textbar} These phenotypic features can robustly distinguish patient groups from healthy controls, and outperformed classifiers trained on morphological and connectivity measures based on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, these phenotypic features encompass a wide range of domains, including personality and traits, positive and negative effects, cognition, sensory processing, and social processing. As an example, a highest proportion of shared phenotypic features consists of personality traits and temperaments defined in the Temperament and Character Inventory pertaining to harm avoidance, novelty seeking, persistence, and reward dependence. Thus, the present disclosure provides a robust data-driven approach to identify transdiagnostic features shared across various patient populations. {\textbar} {\textbar} Cross-cutting symptom subtypes were identified in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or in healthy controls (HC) and mapped onto measures of cognitive, physiological, and functional outcome measures. Reward responsivity, the lack of which is related to anhedonia, is tied to deficits in fMRI connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample of SZ, MDD, BD, and psychosis risk subjects. Derived symptom dimensions correlated with various network-based fMRI connectivity measures in a community sample including representation of multiple psychopathological categories. In some examples, ventral striatal connectivity can predict future depressive order. {\textbar} {\textbar} Genetic risk variants correlate highly across MDD, SZ, BD, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that examining symptoms in this transdiagnostic group could be highly informative. Thus, the present disclosure capitalizes on the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (CNP) dataset which includes three of these patient groups (SZ, BD, ADHD, and additionally healthy controls) and a rich set of clinical symptom evaluations and neuroimaging data for investigating biomarkers of symptom severity. One objective of the present disclosure is predicting severity for a subset of symptoms assessed in the dataset. In some examples, those datasets related to mood and emotional dysregulation are selected, for example, depression/depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and other negative symptoms. {\textbar} {\textbar} While performing correlations is the dominant approach to examine variation along a symptom dimension, the framework of machine learning overcomes some shortcomings of correlative approaches as it allows us to create models and test predictive value and generalizability of those models on held out or new samples. Additionally, multivariate modeling allows a concurrent examination of phenotypes across the multiple levels of expression of mental illness—levels of cognitive behaviors, symptoms, brain measures, etc.—which may improve predictive ability. According to some implementations of the present disclosure, an exemplary method is disclosed for sorting and evaluating features by importance in order to improve biomarker development. {\textbar} {\textbar} Further, the present disclosure provides for predictive models of depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and other negative symptoms. Different types of machine learning (“ML”) models are utilized. Using the CNP dataset, predictability of the models is analyzed. The analysis further includes a comparison of single v. multimodal features. This dataset includes data from clinical scales, resting-state functional-MRI scans, and structural-MRI scans for patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and healthy controls. Thus, the present disclosure provides a custom, data-driven method of identifying subsets of the most predictive features. The present disclosure allows a comparison in an unbiased manner, via different permutations of input feature set and ML model choice. For example, the predictability is analyzed and compared using multi-modal biomarkers and single modality biomarkers. A subset of features that maximized predictability is identified from a set that is several orders of magnitude larger than the subset. As an example, such subset includes edge-level fMRI connectivity features, clinical scale features, and sMRI features. Thus, the present disclosure provides for predicting transdiagnostic symptoms related to depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and other negative symptoms. {\textbar} {\textbar} Nonetheless, selection of the optimal features for exploring predictive models/biomarkers can be difficult in the face of high-dimensional, multi-modal data. An importance-weighted, forward selection approach is taken as a data-driven way to identify the optimal feature subset to include in regression model-building. Finding an optimal subset helps in high-dimensional cases where the number of features (p) is greater than the number of samples (n) to minimize overfitting of the models. It also reduces noise from uninformative input variables without requiring the modeler to judge whether a variable is signal or noise. {\textbar} {\textbar} The importance-weighted, forward selection approach involves an initial rank-ordering step for ordering features by importance, a forward-selection search step for building a series of models utilizing subsets of ordered features selected from the first step, and an evaluation step for evaluating each of these models using these candidate subsets according to a pre-specified criterion to find the optimal model. Thus, this approach integrates feature selection into regression modeling. Additionally, different types of input features are evaluated (e.g., responses to clinical symptom and trait scales, structural MRI measures, functional MRI measures). {\textbar} {\textbar} Two different linear regression algorithms that incorporate feature selection through regularization (Lasso, Elastic Net) and one non-linear algorithm (Random Forest) are also evaluated, in order to identify the best parameters and biomarkers for our selected set of symptom types. Thus, another exemplary method is disclosed herein to find highly-predictive biomarkers for several measures of depressed mood, anxiety, anhedonia and related negative symptoms and to compare the contribution of single versus multimodality feature sets and different algorithms to biomarker-building. {\textbar} {\textbar} As such, another objective of the present disclosure is to better understand the features returned by the best biomarkers at a category level. In line with the objectives herein, the present disclosure is directed to, among others, that 1) multi-modal biomarkers that are more predictive than single modality biomarkers, 2) data-driven methods that identify a subset of features and maximize predictability from a much larger set, and 3) from among that subset, analyzing edge-level fMRI connectivity features, clinical scale features, and sMRI features. In addition, fMRI connectivity features can be broadly distributed across many resting-state networks for most symptom biomarkers (though in some instances, default-mode network connectivity can be more abnormal) and that a few clinical scales are more highly represented than others. {\textbar} {\textbar} Exemplary Systems and Methodologies {\textbar} {\textbar} The present disclosure contemplates that a variety of systems can be used to perform various embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} , an exemplary system {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} is shown, which can be configured to perform various methods of the present disclosure, including methods {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} , {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} , and {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIGS. 29, 30, and 33 {\textbar} , respectively. In particular, system {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} includes a display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} , a user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} , a control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} , and a memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} . In some examples, the system {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} further includes one or more servers {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The user interface {\textbar} {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} is configured to receive input from a user. For example, the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} can be a keyboard, a touchscreen, a mobile device, or any other device for receiving input, as known in the art. The user enters data on the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} in response to prompts on the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} . For example, the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} outputs a series of mental health questions, and the user inputs an answer to each question on the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} . In some examples, the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} directly displays the input on display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} and relays the data to the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} . In some examples, the data is then stored in the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The display {\textbar} {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} is configured to receive data from the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} and the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} . For example, the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} displays input received from the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} ; in some examples, the data is first sent to the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} , which then processes the data and instructs the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} according to the processed data. In other examples, the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} displays data received from the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} . Exemplary data from the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} includes questions from a mental health questionnaire, answer boxes, answer options, answer data, or a mental health indicator. In some examples, the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} is on a smart phone. {\textbar} The present disclosure also contemplates that more than one display {\textbar} {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} can be used in system {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} , as would be readily contemplated by a person skilled in the art. For example, one display can be viewable by a patient, while additional displays are visible to researchers and not to the patient. The multiple displays can output identical or different information, according to instructions by the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The control system {\textbar} {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} can be communicatively coupled to the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} , the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} , and the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} . Further, the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} can be communicatively coupled to the server {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} . For example, the communication can be wired or wireless. The control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} is configured to perform any methods as contemplated according to {\textbar} FIGS. 29-30 {\textbar} (discussed further below). The control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} can process and/or store input from the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} , the user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} , and the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} . In some examples, the methodologies disclosed herein can be implemented, via the control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} , on the server {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} . It is also contemplated that the server {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} includes a plurality of servers, and can be remote or local. Optionally, the control system and/or the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} may be incorporated into the server {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In some examples, system {\textbar} {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} can be a unitary device, for example, a smart phone, which includes a display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} , a user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} , a control system {\textbar} 2806 {\textbar} , and a memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} . {\textbar} Turning now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 29 {\textbar} , an exemplary methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} is discussed for evaluating a patient for mental health issues. Additional details and alternate steps for methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} are discussed further with regards to {\textbar} FIGS. 1A-33 {\textbar} and the corresponding description. {\textbar} Methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} begins at step {\textbar} 2910 {\textbar} which provides for displaying a series of questions. An exemplary series of questions includes questions from mental health questionnaires, and includes both text and answers for each question. In some examples, the series of questions are displayed on a display device (e.g., the display {\textbar} 2802 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} ). {\textbar} In some aspects, the series of questions includes questions determined by a machine learning system (e.g., a machine learning algorithm) to be effective at screening patients. The questions determined by the machine learning system may be more effective than an initial and/or larger set of questions. For example, the machine learning system may be able to pick a number of most effective questions out of an initial set of questions. An exemplary set of most effective questions includes whether the patient agrees with each of the following statements in the past two weeks: “I have more fun doing activities with other people than by myself”; “I have trouble concentrating”; “I have frequent mood changes without understanding why”; “I try to do well at everything I do”; “I need to think for a long time before I make a decision”; “I need a lot of self-control to keep myself out of trouble”; “I am often restless and can't sit still”; “I am very affected when one of my friends seems upset”; “My mood changes more than I think I should”; and “I do not get enough emotional support from other people.” An exemplary set of answers to each of those questions may include: “Strongly Disagree,” “Disagree,” “Neither agree nor disagree,” “Agree,” and “Strongly Agree.” {\textbar} {\textbar} Methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} then provides for, at step {\textbar} 2920 {\textbar} , receiving answers for each of the series of questions (the questions provided for in step {\textbar} 2910 {\textbar} ). In some examples, the answers are received at a user interface (e.g., user interface {\textbar} 2804 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} ). In some examples, the answers include selection of a multiple choice question, a textual response, or any other user input as contemplated by one skilled in the art. In some examples, the answers are retrieved from a record entry corresponding to one patient in a database of patient records. This database can be stored in the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} , for example. In some examples, the database can be stored in the sever {\textbar} 2810 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} . In some examples, methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} begins directly at step {\textbar} 2920 {\textbar} . {\textbar} Step {\textbar} {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} provides for receiving unprocessed MRI data. The unprocessed MRI data corresponds to a set of MRI images of a biological structure. In some examples, the biological structure is associated with the patient. In some examples, the MRI data corresponds to MRI data for a patient's brain (e.g., the same patient who provided answers at step {\textbar} 2920 {\textbar} ). The MRI data can include task-based fMRI data, rs-fMRI data, and/or sMRI data. In some examples, step {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} receives other types of neuroimaging data instead of, or in addition to, the unprocessed MRI data. In additional examples of step {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} can provide for receiving clinical scales data. In some examples of step {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} provides for receiving processed MRI data. {\textbar} Step {\textbar} {\textbar} 2940 {\textbar} then provides for processing, using a machine learning model, the selection of answers from step {\textbar} 2920 {\textbar} and the data received at step {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} (e.g., the unprocessed MRI data). In some examples of methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} , the data received at step {\textbar} 2930 {\textbar} is preprocessed to identify a plurality of features. {\textbar} At step {\textbar} {\textbar} 2950 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} provides for outputting a mental health indication of the patient. In some examples of the present disclosure, step {\textbar} 2850 {\textbar} performs processing of the answers and the received data as discussed further below with respect to methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 30 {\textbar} and methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 33 {\textbar} . In some aspects, the mental health indication is categorical. For example, the mental health indication includes a determination that the processed selection of answers and the processed MRI data includes indications of at least one of: a neuropsychiatric disorder, schizophrenia, a bi-polar disorder, unhealthy generally (versus healthy control) and any combination thereof. {\textbar} In some aspects, methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} further comprises determining that the processed selection of answers and the processed MRI data identifies features corresponding to a mental disorder. {\textbar} Even though methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} is illustrated to include steps {\textbar} 2910 {\textbar} - {\textbar} 2950 {\textbar} , the present disclosure also contemplates more or fewer steps. For example, real-time user input is optional for some implementations of the present disclosure. As such, additional aspects of the present disclosure include a system configured to perform a method, similar to methodology {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} but not including real-time user input. For example, instead of first displaying a series of questions, this method begins with receiving a selection of answers associated with a patient. {\textbar} As another example, questions and answers from a mental health questionnaire is optional for some implementations of the present disclosure. As such, additional aspects of the present disclosure include a system configured to perform a method, similar to methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} but not including a series of questions or a series of answers. For example, using a machine learning model, the unprocessed MRI data are processed to output a mental health indication of the patient, without reference to a selection of answers associated with a patient. {\textbar} Referring now to methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 30 {\textbar} , an exemplary methodology is shown for selecting a machine learning model as a generalized linear model, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In some examples, the machine learning model is any of: a generalized linear model, a logistical regression model, a regression model, a supervised regression method, random forest model, LASSO model, and an elastic net model. In some examples, the machine learning model is any of the models and algorithms discussed further below. In one embodiment of method {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} , the present disclosure provides two regularized general linear model regression algorithms, LASSO and Elastic Net, and one non-linear regression model algorithm, Random Forest. Elastic Net in particular can be used when the number of predictor variables is much greater than the number of samples. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3010 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for receiving labeled training data regarding mental health disorder status for a plurality of individuals. In some examples, the labeled training data identifies whether each of the individuals has one or more mental health disorders and the mental health indicator of their symptoms. The labeled training data includes, for each individual, a selection of answers to mental health questionnaires and includes MRI data. The MRI data can be task-based fMRI data, sMRI data, and/or rs-fMRI data. In some examples, the labeled training data includes other types of neuroimaging data for each individual. In some examples, the labeled training data includes, for each individual, an indication of any of: whether the individual is healthy, whether the individual has a general mental health issue, whether the individual has one or more specific mental health disorders, whether the individual is at risk of developing a general mental health issue, or whether the individual is at risk of developing one or more specific mental health disorders. In some examples, the labeled training data includes another functional and/or physiological measurement dataset, as known in the art. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3020 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for determining features from the labeled training data of step {\textbar} 3010 {\textbar} . The features are determined according to any methods, as known in the art. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3030 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for training an initial machine learning model in a supervised manner, based on the features determined in step {\textbar} 3020 {\textbar} . In some examples, training this initial machine learning model includes using k-fold cross-validation with LASSO and Elastic Net regression. {\textbar} In some examples, training this initial machine learning model in step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3030 {\textbar} includes training the model on clinical scales data corresponding to the plurality of individuals. In some examples, training this initial machine learning model in step {\textbar} 3030 {\textbar} includes training the model on fMRI full connectivity data corresponding to the plurality of individuals. In some examples, training this initial machine learning model in step {\textbar} 3030 {\textbar} includes training the model on sMRI data corresponding to a plurality of individuals, the sMRI data including cortical volume data, cortical thickness data, and cortical surface area data. {\textbar} In some examples, training this initial machine learning model in step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3030 {\textbar} includes training the model on input data corresponding to the plurality of individuals. For each individual, the input data includes a variety of combinations of data. As a first example, the input data includes clinical scales data and fMRI data. As a second example, the input data includes clinical scales data and sMRI data. As a third example, the input data comprises fMRI data and sMRI data. {\textbar} As a fourth example, the input data comprises fMRI data, clinical scales data, and sMRI data. This particular combination of input data provides a high r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} metric (calculated on an untouched evaluation set data to avoid biasing and overfitting our models) when using Elastic Net across the different outcome variables. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3040 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for extracting importance measures for each of the features. These importance measures are selected based on the trained initial machine learning model. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3050 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for generating a plurality of subset machine learning models, based on the extracted importance measures of step {\textbar} 3040 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3060 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for evaluating a regression performance of the generated subset machine learning models from step {\textbar} 3050 {\textbar} . In some examples, each of the subset machine learning models includes a different selection of features. In some examples, the subset machine learning models include only features with an importance measure above a threshold value. In some examples, the features are ranked based on the importance measure. In some examples, each of the subset machine learning models includes a sequentially lower number of features than a following subset machine learning model, wherein the features are selected for each subset machine learning model based on a highest importance measure. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3070 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} provides for selecting one of the subset machine learning models as a generalized linear learning model. The selection is based on the regression performances as evaluated in step {\textbar} 3060 {\textbar} . The selected subset machine learning model includes a portion of the plurality of features determined from step {\textbar} 3020 {\textbar} . The portion of features is selected from features with an importance measure above a threshold value. In some examples, more than one subset machine learning model is selected. {\textbar} In some examples of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3070 {\textbar} , the threshold value is set so that at least twenty features of the plurality of features determined in step {\textbar} 3020 {\textbar} have an importance measure above the threshold value. In some examples, the threshold value is set to select a portion of between ten and twenty features. {\textbar} In some examples of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3070 {\textbar} , the features of the machine learning model are stored in a non-transitory processor-readable storage medium (e.g., memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} ). The features can then be later used as a screening tool. In some examples, the screening tool can output a mental health indicator of a mental health condition. In some examples, the screening tool assesses intermediate and/or end-point outcomes in clinical trial testing for treatment responses. {\textbar} Therefore, the selected machine learning model can then be used to process any of the input data as provided for in the present disclosure. {\textbar} {\textbar} Referring now to methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 33 {\textbar} , an exemplary methodology is shown for selecting a machine learning model as a diagnostic classifier, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} can be applied in place of, or in combination of, methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 30 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3310 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for receiving labeled training data regarding mental health disorder status for a plurality of individuals. The labeled training data includes data for a plurality of individuals, which indicate whether each of the individuals has one or more of a plurality of mental health disorders. The labeled training data further includes a selection of answers to mental health questionnaires for each of the individuals, and MRI data recorded for each of the plurality of individuals. {\textbar} In some aspects, the labeled training data of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3310 {\textbar} includes, for each individual, an indication of whether the individual is healthy, whether the individual has a general mental health issue, whether the individual has one or more specific mental health disorders, whether the individual is at risk of developing a general mental health issue, whether the individual is at risk of developing one or more specific mental health disorders, or the like, or any combination thereof. In some aspects, the labeled training data of step {\textbar} 3310 {\textbar} further includes functional measurement data and/or physiological measurement data. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3320 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for determining features from the labeled training data of step {\textbar} 3310 {\textbar} . In some examples, the answers and MRI data of the received labeled training data are processed to output a plurality of features. The features are determined according to any methods, as known in the art. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3330 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for training an initial machine learning model in a supervised manner, based at least in part on the received labeled training data. In some examples, the initial machine learning model is trained based on the features determined in step {\textbar} 3320 {\textbar} . In some examples, training this initial machine learning model includes using k-fold cross validation with logistic regression (e.g., with LASSO and/or Elastic Net regression). {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3340 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for extracting importance measures for each of the plurality of features. These importance measures are selected based on the trained initial machine learning model. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3350 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for generating a plurality of subset machine learning models, based on the extracted importance measures of step {\textbar} 3340 {\textbar} . In some aspects, each of the subset machine learning models includes a different combination of the features of the initial machine learning model. In some aspects, each of the subset machine learning models includes a different number of the features of the initial machine learning model determined by the importance measures. {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3360 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for evaluating a classification performance of the generated subset machine learning models from step {\textbar} 3350 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} , methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} provides for selecting one of the subset machine learning models as a diagnostic classifier. The selection is based on the classification performances as evaluated in step {\textbar} 3360 {\textbar} . The selected subset machine learning model includes a portion of the plurality of features determined from step {\textbar} 3320 {\textbar} . The portion of features is selected from features with an importance measure above a threshold value. In some examples, more than one subset machine learning model is selected. It is also contemplated that the selected machine learning model can then be used to process any of the input data as provided for in the present disclosure. {\textbar} In some aspects, the selected subset machine learning model of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} includes a portion of the plurality of features. The portion selected from features includes an importance measure above a threshold value. In some aspects, each of the subset machine learning models includes a different selection of the portion of the plurality of features. In some aspects, at least twenty (2) features of the plurality of features have an importance measure above the threshold value. As an example, the portion of the plurality of features includes at least ten (10) features and less than twenty (20) features. As another example, the selected subset machine learning model includes M of the most important N features as determined by the importance measures, wherein M is an integer between 10 and 20 and N is an integer greater than 20. {\textbar} In some aspects, the diagnostic classifier of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} is operative to determine whether an individual is healthy or has a general mental health issue. In some aspects, the diagnostic classifier of step {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} is operative to determine whether an individual is healthy or has a specific mental health disorder. In some aspects, the diagnostic classifier of step {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} is operative to determine whether an individual has a first specific mental health disorder or a second specific mental health disorder. In some aspects, the diagnostic classifier of step {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} is operative to determine whether an individual is at risk of developing a mental health disorder. {\textbar} In some aspects, the selected subset machine learning model of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} includes at least a subset of the following features, or any similar features as known in the art. {\textbar} “I have more fun doing activities with other people than by myself”; {\textbar} “I have trouble concentrating”; {\textbar} “I have frequent mood changes without understanding why”; {\textbar} “I try to do well at everything I do”; {\textbar} “I need to think for a long time before I make a decision”; {\textbar} “I need a lot of self-control to keep myself out of trouble”; {\textbar} “I am often restless and can't sit still”; {\textbar} “I am very affected when one of my friends seems upset”; {\textbar} “My mood changes more than I think I should”; and {\textbar} “I do not get enough emotional support from other people.” {\textbar} In some aspects, the selected subset machine learning model of step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3370 {\textbar} includes at least a subset of the following features, or any similar features as known in the art. {\textbar} “I like to please other people as much as I can”; {\textbar} “There are often times when I am so restless that it is impossible for me to sit still”; {\textbar} “My mood often changes, from happiness to sadness, without my knowing why”; {\textbar} “Although there are things that I enjoy doing by myself, I usually seem to have more fun when I do things with other people”; {\textbar} “I am more sentimental than most people”; {\textbar} “I love to excel at everything I do”; {\textbar} “People consider me a rather freewheeling and spontaneous person”; {\textbar} “I feel that I never really get all that I need from people”; {\textbar} “In unfamiliar surroundings, I am often so assertive and sociable that I surprise myself”; {\textbar} “I like to think about things for a long time before I make a decision”; {\textbar} “Sometimes ideas and insights come to me so fast that I cannot express them all”; {\textbar} “I have many hobbies”; {\textbar} “I like to keep my problems to myself”; {\textbar} “It is difficult for me to keep the same interests for a long time because my attention often shifts to something else”; {\textbar} “How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done”; {\textbar} “I like to go slow in starting work, even if it is easy to do”; and {\textbar} “Usually I am more worried than most people that something might go wrong in the future.” {\textbar} In step {\textbar} {\textbar} 3380 {\textbar} , the features of the diagnostic classifier are stored for subsequent use as a screening tool. In some examples, the features are stored in at least one nontransitory processor-readable storage medium, such as the memory {\textbar} 2808 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} . {\textbar} In some aspects, the methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} further provides for includes using the features of the diagnostic classifier as a screening tool to assess at least one of intermediate or end-point outcomes in at least one clinical trial testing for treatment responses. {\textbar} In some aspects, the methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} further provides for further includes using the features of the diagnostic classifier as a screening tool to assess at least one of intermediate or end-point outcomes in at least one clinical trial testing for treatment responses. {\textbar} In some examples, the machine learning model of methodology {\textbar} {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} can be implemented in a machine learning training system. Similar to the system {\textbar} 2800 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 28 {\textbar} , the machine learning training system includes at least one nontransitory processor-readable storage medium and at least one processor communicatively coupled to the at least one nontransitory processor-readable storage medium. The at least one nontransitory processor-readable storage medium stores at least one of processor-executable instructions or data. The at least one processor, in operation, is configured to receive labeled training data of methodology {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 33 {\textbar} . {\textbar} As discussed herein, conventional diagnostic biomarker approaches do not fully account for the heterogeneity of symptoms under the umbrella of a single diagnosis or the shared symptoms between multiple diagnoses. It must be noted that conventional clinical practice does not provide transdiagnostic, multimodal predictive models of mental health. Thus, based on the seven feature set input, such as the examples disclosed herein with regard to steps {\textbar} {\textbar} 3060 {\textbar} and {\textbar} 3070 {\textbar} , various combinations of feature types are evaluated as inputs. For example, instead of only analyzing one type of biomarkers, the various combinations of input data include single and multimodal feature sets. The experimental data herein provides that the multimodal models perform better than those of single feature sets. Therefore, the models disclosed herein can be highly predictive based at least in part on their transdiagnostic and/or multimodal data input. {\textbar} Experimental Application and Disclosed Models—Part I {\textbar} {\textbar} An experimental methodology is disclosed further herein which provides additional examples of methodologies {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} - {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} and {\textbar} 3300 {\textbar} , as would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The experimental methodology includes experimental results which verify additional aspects of the disclosed systems and methods; the experimental results further verify additional benefits of the present disclosure as compared against conventional systems and methods. {\textbar} The CNP Dataset {\textbar} {\textbar} The CNP dataset is utilized. The CNP dataset contains rich data sources from a variety of modalities. The disclosure herein is focused on identifying shared transdiagnostic features in the phenotype data in the form of clinical scales as well as neuroimaging data (including both structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI). The downloaded dataset in this disclosure included 272 subjects, of which 50 were diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ), 49 with bipolar disorder (BD), and 43 with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The remaining 130 subjects were age-matched healthy controls (HC) recruited from the community. The diagnoses were given by following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; cite DSM) and were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (cite SCID). To better characterize ADHD related symptoms, the Adult ADHD Interview (cite) was further used as a supplement. Out of all subjects, 1 had incomplete phenotype data from the clinical scales used in this disclosure, 10 had missing structural MRI (sMRI) data, and 10 had missing resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. Fifty-five (55) subjects had an aliasing artifact in their sMRI data, whereas 22 subjects had errors in the structural-functional alignment step during MRI preprocessing. These subjects were excluded from the corresponding modeling analyses performed during the methods disclosed herein. The subject numbers and demographics information are given in Table 1. In Table 1, the demographic information is based on initial number of subjects. The number of subjects with sMRI data excludes subjects with aliasing artifacts. The number of subjects with fMRI data excludes subjects with misaligned structural-function imaging data. {\textbar} {\textbar} TABLE 1 {\textbar} {\textbar} Demographic Information {\textbar} {\textbar} HC {\textbar} {\textbar} SCZ {\textbar} BD {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} Total {\textbar} No of subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} 50 {\textbar} 49 {\textbar} 43 {\textbar} 262 {\textbar} With complete phenotype {\textbar} {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} 50 {\textbar} 48 {\textbar} 43 {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} data {\textbar} {\textbar} With sMRI data {\textbar} {\textbar} 98 {\textbar} 30 {\textbar} 44 {\textbar} 34 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} With fMRI data {\textbar} {\textbar} 104 {\textbar} 47 {\textbar} 41 {\textbar} 37 {\textbar} 229 {\textbar} Age {\textbar} {\textbar} Mean age {\textbar} {\textbar} 31.26 {\textbar} 36.46 {\textbar} 35.15 {\textbar} 33.09 {\textbar} SD age {\textbar} {\textbar} 8.74 {\textbar} 8.88 {\textbar} 9.07 {\textbar} 10.76 {\textbar} Range age {\textbar} {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} 22-49 {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} Gender {\textbar} {\textbar} No. of female subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} 12 {\textbar} 21 {\textbar} 22 {\textbar} Percent female subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 47.69\% {\textbar} 24.00\% {\textbar} 42.86\% {\textbar} 51.16\% {\textbar} Race {\textbar} {\textbar} American Indian or {\textbar} {\textbar} 19.23\% {\textbar} 22.00\% {\textbar}  6.25\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar} Alaskan Native {\textbar} {\textbar} Asian {\textbar} {\textbar} 15.38\% {\textbar}  2.00\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} Black/African American {\textbar} {\textbar}  0.77\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  2.08\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} White {\textbar} {\textbar} 78.46\% {\textbar} 66.00\% {\textbar} 77.08\% {\textbar} 88.37\% {\textbar} More than one race {\textbar} {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  2.00\% {\textbar} 14.58\% {\textbar}  6.98\% {\textbar} Education {\textbar} {\textbar} No high school {\textbar} {\textbar}  1.54\% {\textbar} 18.00\% {\textbar}  2.08\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar} High school {\textbar} {\textbar} 12.31\% {\textbar} 44.00\% {\textbar} 29.17\% {\textbar} 23.26\% {\textbar} Some college {\textbar} {\textbar} 20.77\% {\textbar} 18.00\% {\textbar} 25.00\% {\textbar} 30.23\% {\textbar} Associate's degree {\textbar} {\textbar}  7.69\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  6.25\% {\textbar}  6.98\% {\textbar} Bachelor's degree {\textbar} {\textbar} 50.00\% {\textbar} 10.00\% {\textbar} 29.17\% {\textbar} 32.56\% {\textbar} Graduate degree {\textbar} {\textbar}  6.92\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  4.17\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} Other {\textbar} {\textbar}  0.77\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  4.17\% {\textbar}  4.65\% {\textbar} Phenotype Data {\textbar} {\textbar} Subjects were administered a total of 20 questionnaires and scales to capture a wide range of phenotypical data including specific behavioral traits and symptom dimensions. These questionnaires/scales are either clinician-rated or self-reported. While the clinician-rated questionnaires only covered relevant patient groups, 13 self-reported clinical scales were given to all three patient groups as well as the heathy controls. Therefore, subjects' answers to each of the individual questions coming from these 13 self-reported scales are used as input features to the models. Specifically, the 13 self-reported scales used in the methods are: Chapman social anhedonia scale, Chapman physical anhedonia scale, Chapman perceptual aberrations scale, hypomanic personality scale, Hopkins symptom checklist, temperament and character inventory, adult ADHD self-report scale v1.1 screener, Barratt impulsiveness scale, Dickman functional and dysfunctional impulsivity scale, multidimensional personality questionnaire—control subscale, Eysenck's impulsivity inventory, scale for traits that increase risk for bipolar II disorder, and Golden and Meehl's Seven MMPI items selected by taxonomic method. {\textbar} {\textbar} MRI Data Acquisition Parameters {\textbar} {\textbar} MRI data were acquired on one of two 3T Siemens Trio scanners both housed at the University of California, Los Angeles. The sMRI data used in this disclosure are T1-weighted and were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following acquisition parameters: TR=1.9 s, TE=2.26 ms, FOV=250 mm, matrix=256×256, 176 1-mm thick slices oriented along the sagittal plane. The resting-state fMRI data contain a single run lasting 304 s. The scan was acquired using a T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence using the following parameters: 34 oblique slices, slice thickness=4 mm, TR=2 s, TE=30 ms, flip angle=90°, matrix size 64×64, FOV=192 mm. During the resting-state scan, subjects remained still and relaxed inside the scanner, and kept their eyes open. No specific stimulus or task was presented to them. {\textbar} {\textbar} MRI Preprocessing—sMRI {\textbar} {\textbar} Structural MRI preprocessing was implemented using Freesurfer's recon-all processing pipeline. Briefly, the T1-weighted structural image from each subject was intensity normalized and skull-stripped. The subcortical structures, white matter, and ventricles were segmented and labeled according to the algorithm. The pial and white matter surfaces were then extracted and tessellated, and cortical parcellation was obtained on the surfaces according to a gyral-based anatomical atlas which partitions each hemisphere into 34 regions. {\textbar} {\textbar} MRI Preprocessing—Resting-State fMRI {\textbar} {\textbar} Resting-state fMRI preprocessing was implemented in AFNI. Specifically, the first 3 volumes in the data were discarded to remove any transient magnetization effects in the data. Spikes in the resting-state fMRI data were then removed and all volumes were spatially registered with the 4 {\textbar} {\textbar} th {\textbar} volume to correct for any head motion. The Tiw structural image was deobliqued and uniformized to remove shading artifacts before skull-stripping. The skull-stripped structural image was then spatially registered with motion corrected fMRI data. The fMRI data were further spatially smoothed using a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and converted to percent signal change. Separately, the Freesurfer-generated aparc+aseg image from sMRI preprocessing was also spatially registered with and resampled to have the same spatial resolution of the BOLD image. {\textbar} Based on this, eroded white matter and ventricle masks were created, from which nuisance tissue regressors were built based on non-spatially smoothed fMRI data to model and remove variances that are not part of the BOLD signal. Specifically, the ANATICOR procedure is used where a locally averaged signal from the eroded white matter mask within a 25-mm radius spherical region of interest (ROI) centered at each gray matter voxel was used to create a voxel-wise local estimate of the white matter nuisance signal. This local estimate of the white matter nuisance signal, along with the estimated head motions and average signal from the ventricles were detrended with a 4 {\textbar} {\textbar} th {\textbar} order polynomial and then regressed out from the fMRI data. Finally, the clean resting-state fMRI data was spatially normalized to the MI template and resampled to have 2 mm isocubic voxels. {\textbar} Feature Extraction {\textbar} {\textbar} Measures were extracted from 3 data modalities as features: phenotype data from clinical scales, measures derived from the sMRI data, and functional correlations based on resting-state fMRI data. For phenotype features from clinical scales, subjects' responses were directly used from a total of 578 questions from the above listed 13 self-reported clinical scales. Responses from non-True/False type questions were normalized to have a range of between 0 and 1 to match those from True/False type questions. {\textbar} {\textbar} For sMRI features, the following were specifically used 1) the volume of subcortical structures generated by Freesurfer's subcortical volumetric segmentation, and 2) the area, thickness, and volume of cortical brain regions estimated from Freesurfer's surface-based analysis pipeline. For resting-state fMRI features, the brain is first parceled into 264 regions. Specifically, a 5-mm radius spherical ROI was seeded according to the MI coordinates of each brain region specified in the atlas. Second, the clean resting-state BOLD time series from all voxels within a given 5-mm radius spherical ROI were averaged to create the representative time series for the brain region. Third, functional connectivity between ROIs was estimated via the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the average time series from all pairs of brain regions. This resulted in a 264-by-264 correlation matrix, from which 34,716 are unique correlations between two distinct ROIs and were used as input features to the models. {\textbar} {\textbar} Model Fitting and Feature Importance Weighting {\textbar} {\textbar} The primary goals of machine learning analyses in this disclosure are two-fold: 1) to establish robust transdiagnostic classifiers that can reliably separate patient groups from healthy controls, and more importantly 2) to identify important features commonly found across patient groups distinguishing them from healthy controls. To achieve the first goal, the logistic regression model as implemented in the scikit-learn toolbox is utilized. Specifically, 4 transdiagnostic problems based on the DSM diagnosis labels provided in the CNP dataset were addressed: HC vs. All Patients, HC vs. SCZ \& BD, HC vs. SCZ \& ADHD, HC vs. BD \& ADHD. Separate logistic regression models were independently trained using each of the above extracted feature modalities (e.g., phenotype data, sMRI measures, and resting-state fMRI correlations) as inputs and their performances were evaluated in each of the transdiagnostic scenarios. Combinations of 2 and 3 feature modalities were also used as classifiers' inputs and their performances were evaluated in the same fashion. {\textbar} {\textbar} Because the number of features extracted was relatively large compared to the sample size in CNP data, the elastic net regularization term is added in all of the logistic regression models to prevent overfitting. The elastic net regularization is a linear combination of the L1 and L2 regularization terms and has advantages over L1 and L2 regularization when dealing with high-dimensional data with small sample size and correlated features. The use of elastic net regularization in these models also enabled feature selection as the regularization induces sparse models via the grouping effect where all the important features will be retained and the unimportant ones set to zero. This allowed for the identification of predictive features that are shared across multiple patient categories. {\textbar} {\textbar} The elastic net regularized logistic regression implemented in the scikit-learn toolbox contains two hyperparameters: the overall regularization strength and the mixing ratio between the L1 and L2 terms. The following procedure is adopted to determine the best regularization parameters. First, the input data were randomly partitioned into a development set and an evaluation set. The development set contains 80\% of the data upon which a grid search with 3-fold cross validation procedure was implemented to determine the best hyperparameters. Then the model was trained on the entire development set using the best hyperparameters and was further tested on the remaining 20\% of evaluation set which the model had never seen before to obtain testing performance. {\textbar} {\textbar} All features were standardized to have zero mean and unit variance within the training data (the training folds in the 3-fold cross validation or the development set) and the mean and variance from the training data were used to standardize the corresponding test data (the testing fold or the evaluation set) to avoid information spill-over from test data to training data. The entire process was implemented 10 times on 10 different random partitions of the development and evaluation sets. The following metrics were used to quantify the model performances: area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The mean and standard deviation of the above metrics over the 10 evaluation sets were reported. {\textbar} {\textbar} From the above trained models, one can assess how predictive each feature is since the weights of the logistic regression model in the transdiagnostic classifiers represent the relationship between a given feature and the logarithm of the odds ratio of an observation being a patient. For each feature, its corresponding mean model weight is calculated and divided by the standard deviation across the 10 model implementations as the proxy for feature importance. Such a feature importance measure is analogous to the Cohen's d effect size measure and thus favored features with large weights and small standard deviations across the 10 model implementations. Features with large importance values from the transdiagnostic classifiers are potentially symptoms, traits, and neuropathological mechanisms shared across patient groups but are distinct from healthy controls. {\textbar} {\textbar} Feature Importance-Guided Sequential Model Selection {\textbar} {\textbar} Because the feature dimension of the input data is high compared to the sample size in the CNP dataset, the transdiagnostic classifiers using the full feature sets are likely to be subjected to a substantial amount of noise as well as features that are not predictive. The presence of those noisy features, especially when the sample size is small, might impede the ability of the models to achieve their best performances. To investigate whether improved classification performances can be achieved from a reduced set of most predictive features, the following feature importance-guided sequential model selection procedure is utilized. {\textbar} {\textbar} Specifically, first the features in the transdiagnostic classifiers are rank ordered according to their feature importance measures. Next, a series of truncated models was built such that each model would only take the top k most predictive features as inputs to perform the same transdiagnostic classification problems. Let k range from the top 1 most predictive feature to all available features in steps of 1 for clinical phenotype features, sMRI features, and the combination of the two feature sets. For any feature or feature combinations involving fMRI correlations, because of the significantly increased feature dimension, the k's were chosen from a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . ). {\textbar} {\textbar} Model performances were obtained for each truncated model and were evaluated as a function of the number of top features (k) included in each truncated model. To statistically test whether the models' performances are significantly above chance level, a random permutation test is performed where labels in the data (e.g., HC vs. Patients) were shuffled 100 times and models were trained on these label-shuffled data using exactly the same approach as described above. The performances from the 100 models were used to construct the empirical null distribution against which the model performance from the actual data was then compared. {\textbar} {\textbar} For example, {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 1A-1D {\textbar} illustrate boxplots of the maximum AUC's during sequential model selection (the models are discussed further with regard to {\textbar} FIGS. 28-30 {\textbar} and corresponding description). The box represents the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the AUC's across 10 model runs. The line represents the median and the whiskers represent the range of data. {\textbar} Experimental Results {\textbar} {\textbar} In total, classifiers were trained and tested on seven (7) sets of features by either using each individual feature modality (clinical scales, sMRI, and fMRI) or combinations of 2 or 3 feature modalities. The classifiers' performances using each of the seven (7) feature sets on the 4 transdiagnostic cases are reported in Table 2. {\textbar} {\textbar} TABLE 2 {\textbar} {\textbar} Performance of models using the full sets of features {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales + {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales {\textbar} {\textbar} sMRI {\textbar} fMRI {\textbar} s + fMRI {\textbar} Scales + sMRI {\textbar} Scales + fMRI {\textbar} s + MRI {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} AUC {\textbar} 0.83 {\textbar} 0.56 {\textbar} 0.59 {\textbar} 0.57 {\textbar} 0.89 {\textbar} 0.86 {\textbar} 0.86 {\textbar} Patients {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.04) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.04) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} Accuracy {\textbar} {\textbar} 0.77 {\textbar} 0.58 {\textbar} 0.60 {\textbar} 0.61 {\textbar} 0.91 {\textbar} 0.87 {\textbar} 0.86 {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.04) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} AUC {\textbar} 0.90 {\textbar} 0.68 {\textbar} 0.65 {\textbar} 0.69 {\textbar} 0.90 {\textbar} 0.87 {\textbar} 0.89 {\textbar} SCZ + BD {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.09) {\textbar} (0.09) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.04) {\textbar} Accuracy {\textbar} {\textbar} 0.82 {\textbar} 0.68 {\textbar} 0.69 {\textbar} 0.74 {\textbar} 0.90 {\textbar} 0.88 {\textbar} 0.89 {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.10) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.04) {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} AUC {\textbar} 0.85 {\textbar} 0.61 {\textbar} 0.59 {\textbar} 0.60 {\textbar} 0.87 {\textbar} 0.79 {\textbar} 0.81 {\textbar} SCZ + {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} {\textbar} Accuracy {\textbar} 0.77 {\textbar} 0.62 {\textbar} 0.59 {\textbar} 0.65 {\textbar} 0.89 {\textbar} 0.79 {\textbar} 0.81 {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} AUC {\textbar} 0.87 {\textbar} 0.60 {\textbar} 0.54 {\textbar} 0.58 {\textbar} 0.92 {\textbar} 0.91 {\textbar} 0.88 {\textbar} BD + {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.09) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} {\textbar} Accuracy {\textbar} 0.80 {\textbar} 0.60 {\textbar} 0.55 {\textbar} 0.58 {\textbar} 0.92 {\textbar} 0.91 {\textbar} 0.88 {\textbar} (0.07) {\textbar} {\textbar} (0.06) {\textbar} (0.08) {\textbar} (0.09) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} (0.05) {\textbar} Overall, classifiers trained on feature sets involving phenotypical data from clinical scales (e.g., scales and scales+MRI feature sets) outperformed those only trained on MRI features (sMRI, fMRI, and s+fMRI) for all 4 transdiagnostic cases. For classifiers using features involving clinical scales, the mean AUC ranged from 0.79 to 0.92 (mean accuracy: 0.77-0.92), whereas the mean AUC ranged from 0.54 to 0.69 (mean accuracy: 0.55-0.74) for MRI feature sets. {\textbar} {\textbar} The importance of each feature in terms of its predictability of distinguishing HC from patient populations was estimated by the mean over standard deviation of the weights from 10 implementations of the above transdiagnostic classifiers. Based on this importance ranking of each individual feature, a set of truncated models were built sequentially by including only the top k (k ranging from 1 to all features) most predictive features in the models to identify the best subset of features producing the highest classification performance. The performance measures from the best truncated classification models are shown in {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 1A-1D {\textbar} and Table 3, with the AUC from all transdiagnostic models being significantly above chance level as assessed via the random permutation test (all p's{\textless}0.05; see {\textbar} FIGS. 7A-7D {\textbar} —illustrating actual AUC's (shown as a small circle) versus the distribution of AUC's from classifiers trained and tested on randomly permuted class labels). {\textbar} TABLE 3 {\textbar} {\textbar} Best model performance during sequential model selection

2A and 2B {\textbar} , the time complexity of the importance-guided forward model selection procedure is illustrated. {\textbar} FIG. 2A {\textbar} shows that the computation time (median across three implementations) grew linearly as the number of features increases in importance-guided forward model selection procedure. The round dots represent the actual data points, whereas the solid line is the best fitted regression line (slope: 0.03; intercept: 0.80). {\textbar} FIG. 2B {\textbar} shows that reduced computation time was achieved via sequential model selection procedure (round dots with solid line) compared to the estimated time complexity of a brute force feature selection procedure where all combinations of features are evaluated (triangles with dashed line). {\textbar} Referring again to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 2A {\textbar} , the median computation time across three (3) implementations of the feature importance-guided sequential model selection procedure grew linearly as the number of input features increased. As shown in {\textbar} FIG. 2B {\textbar} , complexity is much reduced compared to the estimated time complexity from a brute force feature selection approach where all possible combinations of features were evaluated. The computation time of the brute force approach increased exponentially as the number of input features increased and quickly became intractable even for very small number of features ( {\textbar} FIG. 2B {\textbar} ). {\textbar} More importantly, significantly improved performance was obtained from the best truncated classification models compared with the corresponding models using the full sets of features (all p's{\textless}0.05 as assessed by rank-sum tests; Table 4). The test results were obtained using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. {\textbar} {\textbar} TABLE 4 {\textbar} {\textbar} Test results comparing performances of the best truncated models against the full {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales + {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales {\textbar} {\textbar} sMRI {\textbar} fMRI {\textbar} s + fMRI {\textbar} Scales + sMRI {\textbar} Scales + fMRI {\textbar} s + fMRI {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} Test {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 99.5 {\textbar} 82.5 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 95 {\textbar} Patients {\textbar} {\textbar} statistic {\textbar} p-value {\textbar} {\textbar} 0.000182 {\textbar} 0.000181 {\textbar} 0.000183 {\textbar} 0.000211 {\textbar} 0.01537 {\textbar} 0.000182 {\textbar} 0.000769 {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} Test {\textbar} 94.5 {\textbar} 91 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 94 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} SCZ + {\textbar} {\textbar} statistic {\textbar} BD {\textbar} {\textbar} p-value {\textbar} 0.000853 {\textbar} 0.002152 {\textbar} 0.000182 {\textbar} 0.000245 {\textbar} 0.000172 {\textbar} 0.000977 {\textbar} 8.74E−05 {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} Test {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 92 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} SCZ + {\textbar} {\textbar} statistic {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} {\textbar} p-value {\textbar} 0.000179 {\textbar} 0.000183 {\textbar} 0.001699 {\textbar} 0.000182 {\textbar} 0.000179 {\textbar} 0.000162 {\textbar} 0.00018 {\textbar} HC vs. {\textbar} {\textbar} Test {\textbar} 96 {\textbar} 94 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} 96 {\textbar} 88 {\textbar} 95.5 {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} BD + {\textbar} {\textbar} statistic {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} {\textbar} p-value {\textbar} 0.00058 {\textbar} 0.001008 {\textbar} 0.000182 {\textbar} 0.000577 {\textbar} 0.00451 {\textbar} 0.00063 {\textbar} 0.000176 {\textbar} Referring now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 3A-3D {\textbar} , illustrating the ROC from the truncated models producing the best AUC using phenotype data as features. For all four (4) transdiagnostic cases, the truncated classification models using feature sets involving clinical scales had high performance with the mean AUC ranging from 0.95 to 1.00 (mean accuracy: 0.81-0.94). These models performed better compared to those using feature sets based solely on MRI, which had mean AUC ranging from 0.73-0.93 and mean accuracy ranging from 0.68-0.87. Among the truncated models using feature sets involving clinical scales, those using data only from clinical scales can already achieve very high performance with AUC ranging from 0.95 to 0.99 (see {\textbar} FIGS. 3A-3D {\textbar} ). Combining MRI features with clinical scales do not seem to further improve the models' performance. {\textbar} Turning now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 6A-6D {\textbar} , AUC's are illustrated as a function of the number of top features included during sequential model selection. The dark trace represents the mean AUC across ten (10) iterations of the sequential model selection procedure and the shaded area represents the mean+/−1 standard deviation. As shown, the performances of all truncated models in terms of AUC increased initially as the number of top features k increased. Interestingly, after reaching the highest classification performance, adding more features caused the performance to deteriorate, suggesting that increasingly amount of noise are present in features deemed less predictive by the classification model. {\textbar} The number of top features needed to produce the best truncated classification models for all four (4) transdiagnostic cases are listed in Table 3. The number of top features needed was relatively small for models involving clinical scales: 85-130 out of 578 features for models using only clinical scales; 58-312 out of 839 features for scales plus sMRI feature set; 32-512 out of 35294 features for scales plus fMRI; 64-512 out of 35555 features for scales plus sMRI and fMRI feature set. On the other hand, the number of top features needed to reach best performance for models involving fMRI was relatively large: 8192-16384 out of 34716 features for fMRI alone; 8192-16384 out of 34977 features for sMRI plus fMRI. For models using sMRI features alone, the model complexity was relatively low (89-136 out of 261 features). {\textbar} {\textbar} Based on the above analyses, models using phenotype data from clinical instruments produced high classification performance while at the same time maintained a relatively low model complexity compared to models using MRI-only features. This suggests that the phenotypical data captured by the 13 self-reported instruments may contain a compact set of shared features that are common across the patient populations but are highly distinct from healthy controls. Examining these shared phenotypical features is further focused below. {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 4 {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrates the percentage of questions from each of the thirteen (13) questionnaires among the set of most predictive questions producing the highest AUC. “Barratt” represents Barratt impulsiveness scale; “bipolari” represents Scale for Traits that Increase Risk for Bipolar II Disorder; “chaphypo” represents Hypomanic Personality Scale; “chapper” represents Chapman Perceptual Aberration Scale; “chapphy” represents Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale; “chapsoc” represents Chapman Social Anhedonia Scale; “dick” represents Dickman Functional \& Dysfunctional Impulsivity Scale; “Eysenck” represents Eysenck Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness \& Empathy Scale; “asrs” represents Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v1.1 Screener; “golden” represents Golden and Meehl's {\textbar} 7 {\textbar} MMPI Items; “Hopkins” represents Hopkins Symptom Checklist; “mpq” represents Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire—Control Subscale; and “tci” represents Temperament and Character Inventory. {\textbar} To investigate these shared phenotypical features, the proportion of questionnaire items from each clinical scale selected to be among the top set of features by the best truncated model (having the highest AUC) are shown in {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 4 {\textbar} . For all four (4) transdiagnostic classifiers, items from all 13 instruments were selected to be among the top features by the classifiers, which suggests that patient populations share a wide range of phenotypes that are distinct from healthy controls. These instruments cover broad phenotypes and symptom domains encompassing personality and traits, positive and negative effects (reward, fear, and anxiety), cognition (attention, response inhibition/impulsivity), sensory processing (perceptual disturbances), and social processing. {\textbar} FIGS. 5A-5D {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrate comparing the count of items from each questionnaire among the actual set of most predictive questions with those from randomly ordered lists of questions. While all questions included among the top features are highly predictive of patients from healthy controls, the instruments having the largest proportions among the top questions from all 4 transdiagnostic classifiers are the temperament and character inventory, the hypomanic personality scale, and Eysenck's impulsivity inventory. To examine whether particular instruments have significantly higher number of items among top questions (reaching highest AUC) than chance, the list of questions 100 times is shuffled and compared the number of top questions from each instrument obtained from the shuffled lists with the actual counts (see {\textbar} FIGS. 5A-5D {\textbar} ). {\textbar} These items from such instruments may indicate traits and symptom dimensions strongly represented across specific patient populations. For Healthy vs. Patients classifier, the temperament and character inventory had significantly higher count than chance. The individual items overall covered aspects of temperament pertaining to harm avoidance, novelty seeking, persistence, and reward dependence. For Healthy vs. SCZ \& BD classifier, both the hypomanic personality scale and the Golden and Meehl's Seven MMPI items had significantly higher count than chance. For Healthy vs. SCZ \& ADHD classifier, again the hypomanic personality scale had significantly higher count than chance. For Healthy vs. BD \& ADHD classifier, the ADHD self-report scale v1.1 screener had significantly higher count than chance. {\textbar} {\textbar} Additional Information {\textbar} {\textbar} In this disclosure, robust transdiagnostic classifiers is built based on phenotype data obtained from clinical instruments and MRI data to distinguish SCZ, BD, and ADHD patients from healthy controls. The feature importance-guided forward model selection approach adopted in this disclosure was shown to 1) produce transdiagnostic classifiers having outstanding performance and 2) identify the set of most predictive features shared across the patient populations. The classifiers based on phenotype data from clinical instruments reliably predicted patients from healthy controls. Interestingly, combining the phenotype data with MRI data did not significantly improve the results, suggesting that a robust set of features shared across patient populations can be found in phenotype data alone. Further investigation of the shared phenotypical features revealed that patient populations share a broad range of abnormal psychopathological dimensions spanning personality and traits, positive and negative affect, cognition, sensory and social processing. Overall, a data-driven approach is presented, which does not rely on a-priori hypotheses to build robust transdiagnostic classifiers and to mine the shared psychopathological dimensions across patient populations. {\textbar} {\textbar} The use of machine learning tools in psychiatry to systematically search for consistent patterns in clinical data across disease categories defined in DSM is an emerging trend. A substantial body of prior studies have focused on patient subtyping within a given. The present disclosure includes machine learning methods to develop transdiagnostic perspectives on the symptom dimensions and psychopathology. The machine learning approaches can include classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to mine the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions underlying various psychiatric disorders. {\textbar} {\textbar} Some machine learning approaches either adopted a hypothesis-driven approach wherein a subset of measures (e.g., phenotype data from a given instrument and/or neuroimaging measures from a set of brain regions) were preselected based on a priori knowledge, or used the full set of input features without considering their relative importance in terms of predictive ability. Such approaches may not be ideal since neither of them lets the algorithm to be trained on the optimal set of features. This disclosure uses feature importance to guide forward model selection while building transdiagnostic classifiers to identify shared psychopathological features across multiple disease categories. The superb performance of the truncated models selected via this model selection approach demonstrate the robustness of the identified features. {\textbar} {\textbar} A broad set of phenotypes from the self-report clinical instruments were identified by the transdiagnostic classifiers to be shared across the patient populations. The phenotypes are distributed across all 13 self-reported clinical instruments and covers symptom domains encompassing personality and traits, positive and negative effects, cognition, sensory and social processing. There are shared symptom domains across SCZ, BD, and ADHD. In addition, these three disorders are significantly correlated risk factors for heritability. For SCZ and BD, shared features are identified both in terms of symptoms and the underlying psychopathology and biology. Similarly, shared symptoms and biology are identified between SCZ and ADHD. In addition, shared features are identified between BD and ADHD, along with high levels of comorbidity between them. Thus, this disclosure provides a data-driven confirmation on the shared phenotypes and symptoms across the three disease categories. {\textbar} {\textbar} An interesting finding is that in all four transdiagnostic classifiers, the temperament and character inventory had the largest proportion of questions among the set of most predictive questions determined by the classifier. The personality traits and characters defined in the TCI are associated with various mood disorders. Specifically, for disorders in the CNP dataset, positive association can be found between personality dimensions characterized in TCI and overall ADHD symptom as well as subtypes of ADHD. For SCZ, links are identified between positive and negative symptom dimensions and TCI factors. Among BD patients, personality profiles are identified that are distinct from healthy controls, and these profiles were further found to be shared with MDD. {\textbar} {\textbar} Further, this disclosure establishes the usefulness of personality traits as a set of robust transdiagnostic features. The fact that the TCI had the highest number of questions among top features in all four transdiagnostic classifiers suggests a broad domain of shared personality traits across these three patient categories. {\textbar} {\textbar} While the transdiagnostic classifiers selected questions from all 13 self-reported questionnaires, statistical tests between the actual count of questions from each questionnaire and those from a randomly shuffled importance ordering revealed subtle differences between the classifiers for different combinations of patient populations. These differences may in particular reflect clustered personality traits and symptom dimensions across specific patient populations. For the HC vs. SCZ \& BD case, the elevated item count from the hypomanic personality scale is consistent with the results obtained in the original paper by Eckblad and Chapman where high scorers on the hypomanic personality scale reported more schizotypical features in addition to increased hypomanic and depressive episodes. A 13-year follow-up of these high scorers showed that they had more mood and psychotic-like symptoms compared to healthy controls. Therefore, the items from the hypomanic personality scale may capture these clustered symptom domains. {\textbar} {\textbar} Additionally, the elevated item count from the Golden and Meehl's {\textbar} {\textbar} 7 {\textbar} MMPI items may reflect clustered phenotypes from the so-called “schizotypy” dimension within SCZ and BD patients. For HC vs. SCZ \& ADHD case, the hypomanic personality scale again had elevated item count. Symptom overlaps are identified, as well as genetic links between ADHD and schizophrenia and other psychosis disorders. Specifically, off-springs of SCZ patients are found to be more likely to have higher ratings of hyperactivity, which encompasses symptoms including increased activity, impulsivity, distractibility, and low tolerance for frustration. Such externalizing and attention problems are shared between ADHD and psychosis among adolescents. Therefore, the selected items from the hypomanic personality scale may reflect the shared hyperactivity domains across SCZ and ADHD patients. Finally, for the HC vs. BD \& ADHD case, the elevated item count from ADHD self-report scale v1.1 screener may indicate the similar aspects between hyperactivity and manic symptoms as well as other shared symptoms such as inattention between BD and ADHD patients. {\textbar} Experimental Method and Additional Details—Part II {\textbar} {\textbar} An experimental methodology is disclosed further herein which provides additional examples of methodologies {\textbar} {\textbar} 2900 {\textbar} and {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} , as would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The experimental methodology includes experimental results which verify additional aspects of the disclosed systems and methods; the experimental results further verify additional benefits of the present disclosure as compared against conventional systems and methods. {\textbar} Participants {\textbar} {\textbar} Four groups of subjects were included in the sample which was drawn from adults ages 21-50: healthy controls (HC, n=130), Schizophrenia patients (SZ, n=50), Bipolar Disorder patient (BD, n=49), and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, n=43). Stable medications were permitted for participants. Diagnoses were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and supplemented with the Adult ADHD Interview. Out of all subjects, one had incomplete clinical phenotype data from the clinical scales used, 10 had missing structural MRI (sMRI) data, and 10 had missing resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. Fifty-five subjects had an aliasing artifact in their sMRI data, whereas 22 subjects had errors in the structural-functional alignment step during MRI preprocessing. These subjects were excluded from the corresponding modeling analyses performed. {\textbar} {\textbar} The participant numbers and demographics information are given in Table 5. In Table 5, the demographic information is based on initial number of subjects. The number of subjects with sMRI data excludes subjects with aliasing artifacts. The number of subjects with fMIR data excludes subjects with misaligned structural-function imaging data. {\textbar} {\textbar} TABLE 5 {\textbar} {\textbar} Participant Demographics {\textbar} {\textbar} HC {\textbar} {\textbar} SCZ {\textbar} BD {\textbar} ADHD {\textbar} No. of subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} 50 {\textbar} 49 {\textbar} 43 {\textbar} With complete phenotype data {\textbar} {\textbar} 130 {\textbar} 50 {\textbar} 48 {\textbar} 43 {\textbar} With sMRI data {\textbar} {\textbar} 98 {\textbar} 30 {\textbar} 44 {\textbar} 34 {\textbar} With fMRI data {\textbar} {\textbar} 104 {\textbar} 47 {\textbar} 41 {\textbar} 37 {\textbar} Age {\textbar} {\textbar} Mean age {\textbar} {\textbar} 31.26 {\textbar} 36.46 {\textbar} 35.15 {\textbar} 33.09 {\textbar} SD age {\textbar} {\textbar} 8.74 {\textbar} 8.88 {\textbar} 9.07 {\textbar} 10.76 {\textbar} Range age {\textbar} {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} 22-49 {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} 21-50 {\textbar} Gender {\textbar} {\textbar} No. of female subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} 12 {\textbar} 21 {\textbar} 22 {\textbar} Percent female subjects {\textbar} {\textbar} 47.69\% {\textbar} 24.00\% {\textbar} 42.86\% {\textbar} 51.16\% {\textbar} Race {\textbar} {\textbar} American Indian or Alaskan Native {\textbar} {\textbar} 19.23\% {\textbar} 22.00\% {\textbar}  6.25\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar} Asian {\textbar} {\textbar} 15.38\% {\textbar}  2.00\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} Black/African American {\textbar} {\textbar}  0.77\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  2.08\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} White {\textbar} {\textbar} 78.46\% {\textbar} 66.00\% {\textbar} 77.08\% {\textbar} 88.37\% {\textbar} More than one race {\textbar} {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  2.00\% {\textbar} 14.58\% {\textbar}  6.98\% {\textbar} Education {\textbar} {\textbar} No high school {\textbar} {\textbar}  1.54\% {\textbar} 18.00\% {\textbar}  2.08\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar} High school {\textbar} {\textbar} 12.31\% {\textbar} 44.00\% {\textbar} 29.17\% {\textbar} 23.26 {\textbar} Some college {\textbar} {\textbar} 20.77\% {\textbar} 18.00\% {\textbar} 25.00\% {\textbar} 30.23\% {\textbar} Associate's degree {\textbar} {\textbar}  7.69\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  6.25\% {\textbar}  6.98\% {\textbar} Bachelor's degree {\textbar} {\textbar} 50.00\% {\textbar} 10.00\% {\textbar} 29.17\% {\textbar} 32.56\% {\textbar} Graduate degree {\textbar} {\textbar}  6.92\% {\textbar}    0\% {\textbar}  4.17\% {\textbar}  2.33\% {\textbar} Other {\textbar} {\textbar}  0.77\% {\textbar}  4.00\% {\textbar}  4.17\% {\textbar}  4.65\% {\textbar} CNP Dataset {\textbar} {\textbar} Of the extensive behavioral testing that participants underwent, results were analyzed from tests of their symptoms and traits, either clinician-administered or self-reported. The self-reported tests used in our analysis include Chapman social anhedonia scale (chapsoc), Chapman physical anhedonia scale (chapphy), Chapman perceptual aberrations scale (chapper), Chapman hypomanic personality scale, Hopkins symptom checklist (hopkins), Temperament and character inventory (tci), Adult ADHD self-report scale v1.1 screener (asrs), Barratt impulsiveness scale (barratt), Dickman functional and dysfunctional impulsivity scale (dickman), Multidimensional personality questionnaire—control subscale (mpq), Eysenck's impulsivity inventory (eysenck), Scale for traits that increase risk for bipolar II disorder (bipolarii), and Golden and Meehl's Seven MMPI items selected by taxonomic method (Golden). The clinician-administered scales used in our analysis include Hamilton rating scale for depression (hamd), the Brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs), and Scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (sans). {\textbar} {\textbar} All participants used in this sample also underwent magnetic resonance imaging sessions with T1 scans (structural MRI) and T2* scans of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional-MRI and several tasks. The sMRI and resting-state fMRI data (304 seconds in length) were utilized. Resting-state fMRI data were analyzed. The resting-state fMRI data provided a fine-grained, data-driven set of functional connectivity features that exhibit meaningful individual differences that relate to symptoms. {\textbar} {\textbar} Preprocessing Data into Features {\textbar} {\textbar} All responses to individual questions were used, from the 13 self-report scales as input features for a total of 578 questions. Subjects who had missing values for any scales used in a particular model were not included in that model. Outcome variables for modeling depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and related negative symptoms were also selected from clinical scales, either self-report or clinician-administered. {\textbar} {\textbar} sMRI {\textbar} {\textbar} Preprocessing of sMRI was performed using Freesurfer's recon-all processing pipeline. Briefly, the T1-weighted structural image from each subject was intensity normalized and skull-stripped. The subcortical structures, white matter, and ventricles were segmented and labeled according to the algorithm described in. The pial and white matter surfaces were then extracted and tessellated, and cortical parcellation was obtained on the surfaces according to a gyral-based anatomical atlas which partitions each hemisphere into 34 regions. {\textbar} {\textbar} Preprocessing of fMRI was performed using AFNI. Preprocessing of each subject's echo planar image (EPI) data included several steps: removal of the first 3 volumes (before the scanner reached equilibrium magnetization), de-spiking, registration of all volumes to the now first volume, spatial smoothing with a 6 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian filter, and normalization of all EPI volumes by the mean signal to represent data as percent signal change. Anatomical data also underwent several steps: deobliquing of the T1 data, uniformization of the T1 to remove shading artifacts, skull-stripping of the T1, spatial alignment of the T1 and Freesurfer-segmented and -parceled anatomy to the first volume of the EPI data, and resampling of the Freesurfer anatomy to the resolution of the EPI data. Subsequently, the ANATICOR procedure was used for nuisance tissue regression. White matter and ventricle masks were created and used to extract the BOLD signals (before spatially-smoothing the BOLD signal). A 25 mm-radius sphere at each voxel of the white matter mask was used to get averaged local white matter signal estimates while the average ventricle signal was calculated from the whole ventricle mask. Time series for the motion estimates, and the BOLD signals in the ventricles and white matter were detrended with a 4 {\textbar} {\textbar} th {\textbar} order polynomial. To clean the BOLD signal, the nuisance tissue regressors and the six motion estimate parameters were regressed out. Cleaned data residuals were used for all subsequent analysis. {\textbar} Both the preprocessed T1 scan and the cleaned residuals of the EPI scan were warped to MNI space and resampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels. The time series of the cleaned residual data was extracted from each of 264 regions of interest (ROIs) as delineated by the Power atlas. At each ROI, the signals from the voxels within a 5 mm radius sphere were averaged. Pearson's correlations were then calculated between the averaged time series from all ROIs yielding 34716 unique edges in the functional connectivity graph (upper triangle of the full correlation matrix). Quality control (QC) for MRI preprocessing was performed individually on the whole dataset, and rejection decisions were made for each participant's sMRI and fMRI data, respectively. Discrepancies were resolved in order to create a final rejection list of participants. {\textbar} {\textbar} Input features for each subject came from the three preprocessed datasets: raw scores on the 578 individual items of 13 self-report clinical scales, Freesurfer-calculated structural measurements (including subcortical volume, cortical volume, cortical area, cortical thickness), and AFNI-calculated functional connectivity scores between individual ROIs. Subsets of these input features were used as predictor variables in subsequent modeling as explained below. Output variables that were modeled included those which indexed depression, anxiety, anhedonia, or other negative symptoms. A mix of total scores, sub-scale sum or average scores, and individual question scores as each has their advantages. {\textbar} {\textbar} These scores include the 28-question versions of the total HAMD score (‘hamd’), the HAMD subscore for questions 1, 7, and 8 (‘hamd178’, indexes a melancholic-type of symptom), the HAMD item score for question 7 (‘hamd7’, indexes lack of interest or anhedonia), the Chapman Social Anhedonia total score (‘chapsoc’), the Chapman Physical Anhedonia total score (‘chapphy’), BPRS negative subscore (‘bprs\_negative’, the average of negative symptom questions 13, 16, 17, and 18), BPRS depression-anxiety subscore (‘bprs\_depanx’, the average of depression and anxiety symptom questions 2, 3, 4, and 5), Hopkins anxiety score (‘hopkins\_anxiety’, the average of anxiety symptom questions 2, 17, 23, 33, 39, and 50), Hopkins depression score (‘hopkins\_depression’, the average of depression symptom questions 5, 15, 19, 20, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 54), Bipolar ii mood score (‘bipolarii\_mood’, the sum of mood questions 1-9), Bipolar ii anxiety score (‘bipolar anxiety’, the sum of anxiety questions 24-31), SANS anhedonia factor score (‘sans factor\_anhedonia’, the average of anhedonia questions 17, 18, 19, and 20), SANS anhedonia global score (‘sans\_global\_anhedonia’, questions 21 which is the clinician's overall anhedonia assessment score), SANS avolition factor score (‘sans factor\_avolition’, the average of avolition items 12, 13, 14, and 15), SANS avolition global score (‘sans\_globals\_avolition’, question 16 which is the clinician's overall avolition assessment score), SANS blunt affect factor score (‘sans\_factor\_bluntaffect’, the average of affective flattening items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), SANS blunt affect global score (‘sans\_global\_bluntaffect’, question 7 which is the clinician's overall blunt affect assessment score), SANS alogia factor score (‘sans\_factor\_alogia’, the average of alogia items 8, 9, and 10), SANS alogia global score (‘sans\_global\_alogia’, question 11 which is the clinician's overall alogia assessment score), SANS attention factor score (‘sans\_factor\_attention’, the average of attention items 22 and 23), and SANS attention global score (‘sans\_global\_attention’, question 24 which is the clinician's overall attention assessment score). {\textbar} {\textbar} Sum scores are commonly accepted by the FDA regarding positive efficacy results, but using only sum scores may obfuscate brain-behavior relationships at more fine-grained levels of symptoms. Subjects with missing values (“n/a”) for any input or output variables or who did not pass MRI QC were removed from the input set. As different input feature sets were used, different models had different sample sizes. The availability of clinical scores for particular clinical scales taken only by certain subsets of patients also affected the final sample size for each model. The samples sizes resulting from these factors are listed in Table 6. {\textbar} {\textbar} TABLE 6 {\textbar} {\textbar} Sample size for each model {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales\_ {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales\_ {\textbar} {\textbar} sMRI\_ {\textbar} Predicted Scores {\textbar} {\textbar} Scales {\textbar} sMRI {\textbar} sMRI {\textbar} Scales\_sMRI {\textbar} sMRI\_fMRI {\textbar} fMRI {\textbar} fMRI {\textbar} Chapman Social Anhedonia {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} Chapman Physical {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} Anhedonia {\textbar} {\textbar} HAMD, total score {\textbar} {\textbar} 141 {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} 82 {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} 63 {\textbar} 81 {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} HAMD, q1, 7, 8 sum score {\textbar} {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} 82 {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} 63 {\textbar} 81 {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} HAMD, q7 {\textbar} {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} 82 {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} 63 {\textbar} 81 {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} BPRS, negative score {\textbar} {\textbar} 141 {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} 82 {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} 63 {\textbar} 81 {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} BPRS, depression-anxiety {\textbar} {\textbar} 141 {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} 82 {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} 63 {\textbar} 81 {\textbar} 62 {\textbar} score {\textbar} {\textbar} Hopkins, anxiety score {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} Hopkins, depression score {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} Bipolar II, depression score {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} Bipolar II, anxiety score {\textbar} {\textbar} 271 {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} 147 {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} 146 {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} SANS, anhedonia factor {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} score {\textbar} {\textbar} SANS, avolition factor score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} SANS, blunt affect factor {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} score {\textbar} {\textbar} SANS, alogia factor score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} SANS, attention factor score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} SANS, anhedonia global {\textbar} {\textbar} 98 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} score {\textbar} {\textbar} SANS, avolition global score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} SANS, blunt affect global {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} score {\textbar} {\textbar} SANS, alogia global score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} SANS, attention global score {\textbar} {\textbar} 99 {\textbar} 75 {\textbar} 54 {\textbar} 74 {\textbar} 40 {\textbar} 53 {\textbar} 39 {\textbar} Regression Modeling {\textbar} {\textbar} All regression modeling was performed with a combination of custom python code and the python toolbox scikit-leam. Twenty-one (21) different sum, sub-, or individual item scores were modeled across the clinical scales. For each of the 21 models, seven combinations of feature types were used as the inputs to be able to evaluate performance of single- and multi-modal feature sets. These included clinical scales only, sMRI only, fMRI only, scales+sMRI, scales+fMRI, sMRI+fVIRI, and scales+sMRI+fMRI. {\textbar} {\textbar} As input features varied in their mean values and regularized models require normally-distributed data, scaled each input feature was scaled separately to have zero mean and unit variance. For each scale output and feature set input, used two regularized general linear model regression algorithms were used—Lasso and Elastic Net—and one non-linear regression model algorithm—Random Forest—for the modeling. These methods improve prediction accuracy and interpretability over regular regression methods using ordinary least squares. {\textbar} {\textbar} The Lasso approach uses regularization by imposing an L {\textbar} {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} -penalty parameter to force some coefficients to zero; this step introduces model parsimony that benefits interpretability and predictive performance. If predictor variables are correlated, however, the Lasso approach will arbitrarily force only a subset of them to zero which makes interpretation of specific features more difficult. The Elastic Net algorithm uses both L {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} - and L2-penalty parameters to better be able to retain groups of correlated predictor variables; this improves interpretability as highly predictive features will not randomly be set to zero thereby diminishing their importance to the model. It is also better suited in cases when the number of predictor variables is much greater than the number of samples (p{\textgreater}{\textgreater}n). The non-linear regression algorithm Random Forest was also chosen for comparison purposes. {\textbar} Thus, 441 (21×7×3) sets of models were built. For each of these sets of models, hyperparameters were tuned using 5-fold cross-validated grid-search on a training set of data (80\% of data), and selected hyperparameters were used on a separate evaluation set of data (20\% held-out sample). The hyperparameter range for Lasso was alpha=[0.01 0.03 and 0.1] (three samples through the log space of [0.01:0.1]). Hyperparameter ranges for Elastic Net were alpha=[0.01 0.03 and 0.1] and l1\_ratio=[0.1 0.5 0.9]. And hyperparameter ranges for Random Forest included number of estimators=[10 100] and minimum samples at a leaf=[1 5 10]. The best hyperparameters were chosen from the model that maximized the r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} score (coefficient of determination) across the 5-fold cross-validation procedure in the training set. All subsequent models were built using the best hyperparameters for that set. {\textbar} FIG. 8A {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrates X-Y plots of number of features versus predicted outcome scores. For example, predicting the total HAMD score using Elastic Net and scales+sMRI+fMRI as input illustrates how median MSE (left, top) and median r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} (left, bottom) varies with each feature subset, each with standard deviation bars. {\textbar} FIG. 8B {\textbar} illustrates a comparison of measured outcome scores and predicted outcome scores. For example, measured versus predicted outcome scores (right) illustrate how closely the model predictions are to actual outcome scores for individuals in the held-out sample. {\textbar} Referring generally to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 8A-9B {\textbar} , for each of the 441 sets of models, an importance-weighted, forward selection approach was used to regression modeling, which involves the following steps: (1) an initial rank-ordering step for ordering features by importance, (2) a forward-selection search step for building a series of models utilizing subsets of ordered features selected from the first step, and (3) an evaluation step for evaluating each of these models using these candidate subsets according to a pre-specified criterion to find the optimal model. This approach thus integrates feature selection into modeling. {\textbar} Each step utilized the grid-search procedure to optimize hyperparameters as explained above. First, the feature rank-ordering step uses the full feature set (either scale only, sMRI only, etc.) as the input to the model algorithms which returns not only predicted values for the evaluation dataset but also the importance of each feature for the resulting model. Feature importance was assessed from the regression coefficients with ordering (most important to least important) based on the absolute value of the coefficient. Ordering by absolute value reflects that features with the largest magnitude influence the symptom severity scores the most. Feature ordering was performed separately for Lasso and Elastic Net models, but as feature importance is harder to assess for the Random Forest algorithm, the ordering from the Elastic Net models was used as input for the subsequent steps of Random Forest modeling instead. {\textbar} {\textbar} Second, the forward-selection search step systematically searches through subsets of the rank-ordered features for the subset that leads to the best model. Since having more features than samples increases the risk of overfitting and uninformative features add noise which decreases model performance, a data-driven method of searching the ordered feature space was selected for an optimal subset of features. A series of regressions was run on subsets of the ordered features with subsets chosen in powers of 2 (e.g., inputting the top feature only, the top 2 features only, the top 4 features only, etc.) up to 2 {\textbar} {\textbar} 15 {\textbar} features. In order to generate descriptive statistics for this step, twenty-five (25) iterations of modeling for each feature subset were used to get median and standard deviation metric scores. The metrics chosen for the final step of evaluation were mean squared error (MSE) and r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} . The median r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} and standard deviation of r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} were found for each subset. {\textbar} The best model overall was selected by finding the maximum median r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} value over all feature subsets and selecting the model that corresponded to that max median r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} value ( {\textbar} FIGS. 9A-9B {\textbar} ). All subsequent follow up is on the 441 best models for each combination of input×model type×output. To find which input feature set (clinical scales only, sMRI only, fMRI only, scales+sMRI, scales+fMRI, sMRI+fMRI, and scales+sMRI+fMR) and which model type (Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest) lead to the best biomarkers, subsequent comparisons were also made based on the r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} of the best models. The r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} is a standardized measurement of explained variance while the MSE values are not standardized across the different models making it less appropriate to use MSE for comparison. {\textbar} Experimental Results {\textbar} {\textbar} Within a multi-modal dataset, the best biomarkers were found for symptom severity. Of the 441 sets of models created, the best median MSE, r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} , and number of features chosen for the best model are listed by input type in Tables 7-15. {\textbar}

{\textbar} −0.250 {\textbar} −0.016 {\textbar} −0.129 {\textbar} −1.084 {\textbar} Weaker models were filtered out by first examining which model algorithm gave the best r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} metric across the outcome variables for each predictor variable. Not only did Elastic Net perform the best according to this criteria (73\% won), but it also returns the most interpretable features (for methodological reasons as discussed herein). Then for each outcome variable the r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} across different predictor variable sets were compared (e.g., Table 14). Overall, both scales+fMRI and scales+sMRI+fMRI input sets had the majority of, but an equal number of, winning models based on r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} (seven winning models each). All other models performed relatively well except sMRI-only models. For comparison with the modeling results using the full feature sets (not the truncated sets returned by the forward modeling approach), as shown in Table 15. These were suboptimal to the forward modeling approach. The features returned for one of the winning sets were further examined. Those models used all three features types as input. {\textbar} Referring to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 9A-12H {\textbar} , for the 21 models with Scales+sMRI+fMRI input feature set, model performance was evaluated on the held-out test set with measured versus predicted plots. {\textbar} FIGS. 9A-9F {\textbar} illustrate measured versus predicted values for best models for depression or depressed mood, according to some implementations of the present disclosure. The measured versus predicted outcome scores (right) illustrate how closely the model predictions are to actual outcome scores for individuals in the held-out sample for this set of models. Held-out sample sizes differ between models since some scales were not given to all participants (e.g., the SANS scale was only given to BD and SZ patients). Similar to {\textbar} FIG. 9A-9F {\textbar} , {\textbar} FIGS. 10A-10E {\textbar} illustrate measured versus predicted values for best models for anhedonia; {\textbar} FIG. 11A-11B {\textbar} illustrate measured versus predicted values for best models for anxiety; and {\textbar} FIGS. 12A-12H {\textbar} illustrate measured versus predicted values for best models for negative symptoms. {\textbar} Referring to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 13 {\textbar} , for the 21 models with Scales+sMRI+fMRI input feature set, model performance was evaluated on the held-out test set with r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} values across models for different outcome variables (see Table 14—last column). {\textbar} FIG. 13 {\textbar} illustrates best median r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} for the best models for each outcome variable. Models selected were using Scales+sMRI+fMRI as the input feature set and Elastic Net. Next to each outcome variable, the corresponding number of non-zero features (p) returned by the model appears. {\textbar} Next, turning to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 14A-14B {\textbar} , proportions of features derived from scale, fMRI, and sMRI feature sets were compared, for the best model for each outcome variable, both among the whole feature set and the top 25\% of features. {\textbar} FIGS. 14A-14B {\textbar} illustrate proportions of feature types in best models. More specifically, {\textbar} FIG. 14A {\textbar} illustrates proportion of all features returned by the model. The densest hatching plots proportion of features from scales; the hatching with medium density plots proportion from fMRI connectivity measures; and the least dense hatching plots proportion from sMRI measures. {\textbar} FIG. 14B {\textbar} illustrates proportion of feature types in the top 25\% of features returned by the model. Thus, {\textbar} FIG. 14B {\textbar} demonstrates that for many outcome variables there is a disproportionate number of scale features in the top features though there are more fMRI features overall in the models (see {\textbar} FIG. 14A {\textbar} ). {\textbar} There is a paucity of sMRI features in both the whole feature set and the top quarter of features. Groupings of the scale-based features were further examined. The groups were sorted by proportion of the scales from which they are derived. For each model, grouped by symptom type of the outcome variable, the scale features for the best model are proportionately selected from the scales shown in {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 15A-18G {\textbar} . The TCI scale in particular is often represented among the top scales by proportion. {\textbar} Referring now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 15A-15F {\textbar} , proportions of features from each scale are illustrated, for best model predicting depression or depressed mood. Of the features returned by the best model that were scale items, each pie chart illustrates the proportion of those items that were from the corresponding scales for the model for each outcome variable. For example, for the SANS, global blunt affect model, 20\% of the scale items were from the TCI scale, 20\% from the chapper scale, 20\% from the chapsoc scale, and 40\% from the Eysenck scale. Similar to {\textbar} FIGS. 15A-15F {\textbar} , {\textbar} FIGS. 16A-16E {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for best model predicting anhedonia; {\textbar} FIGS. 17A-17B {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for best model predicting anxiety; and {\textbar} FIGS. 18A-18G {\textbar} illustrate proportion of features from each scale for best model predicting negative symptoms. {\textbar} Turning generally to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 19A-22H {\textbar} , the fMRI features can also be grouped by suggested canonical resting-state networks from the Power atlas and are shown in the connectivity matrices, according to some implementations of the present disclosure. More specifically, {\textbar} FIGS. 19A-19F {\textbar} illustrate binary heat maps for fMRI connectivity features of best model predicting depression or depressed mood. For all non-zero fMRI connectivity features returned by the respective model, the regression coefficients for each individual edge between two nodes is plotted in the connectivity matrix for that model. Each row and column represents a single ROI from the Power atlas, ordered consistently in both directions. Coefficients have been binarized (positive plotted as stars, negative as circles) for easier viewing of sparse matrices. Upper and lower triangles illustrate redundant information, so only upper triangles are plotted. Lines delineate canonical resting state networks for easier visualization of network category for each feature. Similar to {\textbar} FIGS. 19A-22H {\textbar} , {\textbar} FIGS. 20A-20E {\textbar} illustrate binary heat maps for fMRI connectivity features of best model predicting anhedonia; {\textbar} FIGS. 21A-21B {\textbar} illustrate binary heat maps for fMRI connectivity features of best model predicting anxiety; and {\textbar} FIGS. 22A-22H {\textbar} illustrate binary heat maps for fMRI connectivity features of best model predicting negative symptoms. {\textbar} Binarized versions of the regression coefficients (pos→1, neg→−1) are plotted for better visualization of the location of features across the networks. Connectivity matrices have the same ROIs and networks listed on both axes, and the lower left triangle is redundant to the upper right triangle. Thus data is only plotted in the upper triangle. The predictive fMRI connectivity features appear mostly distributed across multiple networks rather than selective to a few particular networks. The exception for a few outcome variables (‘hamd,’ ‘sans\_global\_bluntaffect,’ ‘chapsoc,’ ‘sans\_global\_anhedonia,’ and ‘sans\_factor\_avolition’) is in connectivity between the DMN and other networks. In particular, the predictive edges between the DMN and other networks mostly originate from the anterior cingulate and/or the medial orbitofrontal lobe. {\textbar} {\textbar} Since the number of samples used in each model varied based on the number of subjects who completed a particular scale and the number of dropped subjects due to poor quality (did not pass QC), some models were built with as few as n=38 subjects (the SANS models with all three input types). To examine if the results could be due to overfitting, r {\textbar} {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} was further compared for just p=32 and 64 features to look at cases where overfitting is less likely (p0.5 suggesting that overfitting is not the major contributor to the high predictability of these models. Thus, predictive value was still largely high with r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} values mostly {\textgreater}0.5 for these models, suggesting that performance in the best models is likely not solely due to overfitting. {\textbar} In addition, according to some implementations of the present disclosure, the models with the least complexity are scales-only models. Results for this set of models is shown in {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 24A-27H {\textbar} . (See Table 14 for metrics of scales-only models). More specifically, {\textbar} FIGS. 24A-24F {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for the scales-only model predicting depression or depressed mood The model using Elastic Net with the median r {\textbar} 2 {\textbar} value was chosen for this further examination. {\textbar} FIGS. 25A-25E {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for scales-only model predicting anhedonia, according to some implementations of the present disclosure; {\textbar} FIGS. 26A-26B {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for scales-only model predicting anxiety, according to some implementations of the present disclosure; {\textbar} FIGS. 27A-27H {\textbar} {\textbar} illustrate proportions of features from each scale for scales-only model predicting negative symptoms, according to some implementations of the present disclosure; {\textbar} Additional Information {\textbar} {\textbar} According to some implementations of the present disclosure, biomarkers were explored for severity of various psychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and other negative symptoms in a transdiagnostic sample. An importance-ranked, forward selection modeling approach was applied to search for the most predictive input features from a set of clinical scale measures, structural MRI measures, and functional MRI measures and to evaluate several different modeling algorithms. Notably, this data-driven methods of selecting feature subsets additionally improved model predictability over models using the whole feature set. Overall, Elastic Net regression with multi-modal inputs, either all three input feature types or a combination of scale scores and fMRI connectivity measures, preformed the best. These models explained the most variance in the outcome measures which were a range of total scores of a scale, scores from a subset of questions from a scale, or individual question scores from a scale for the symptoms evaluated. {\textbar} {\textbar} Elastic Net regression returns regression coefficients which can be examined for further interpretation of biomarkers. The magnitude of the non-zero coefficients included in the best models were evaluated to parse out the features. Overall, the individual, edge-level fMRI connectivity measures between specific network nodes dominated in nearly all of the regression models for different symptom measures, but responses to individual questions in self-report clinical scales were also highly predictive. sMRI measures were not well-represented among the essential features in our models. Scale features also tended to be more highly represented in the top 25\% of features than in the whole set of features returned by the models, though this was not the case for every outcome variable. Thus, their relative importance may be higher than fMRI features, though clearly the multi-modal models performed better than scales-only models suggesting an additive effect to the multi-modal models. Therefore, a comparison of different feature types in transdiagnostic was disclosed, along with identifying a community-based symptom severity biomarker. {\textbar} {\textbar} The categorical origins of the clinical scale features and fMRI features for these models were further investigated. Within each symptom grouping (depression/mood, anxiety, anhedonia, negative symptoms) of the outcome variables, there was also some similarity in the scales from which they were drawn as many included items from the TCI scale, Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and several Chapman scales. The TCI scale in particular was consistently among the top three scales in predicting all but one outcome variable for depression, anxiety, and anhedonia. This scale measures temperaments such as harm avoidance and novelty seeking which are associated with depression and anxiety. {\textbar} {\textbar} The number of scales from which predictor variables were drawn also seemed to correspond to how broad the outcome variable was. For example, ‘hamd,’ ‘chapphy,’ and ‘chapsoc’ outcome variables were all total scores from their respective scales, and their models drew features from more scales than models predicting sub-scores or individual item scores (such as ‘sans\_factor\_bluntaffect’ or ‘hamd7’). This may suggest that predicting more narrowly-defined outcome scores utilizes less scales and may require administration of few scales to patients for optimal modeling at least within multi-modal datasets. {\textbar} {\textbar} Assessing the categorical groupings of importance-ranked fMRI connectivity features for each model was done according to canonical resting-state networks of the Power atlas. This analysis demonstrated that these highly-predictive features are distributed across many networks in many of our models. This may have the implication that it is useful for examining connections between individual nodes when creating models instead of relying solely upon summary metrics of networks such as graph theory metrics. {\textbar} {\textbar} In several models (‘hamd,’ ‘sans\_global\_bluntaffect,’ ‘chapsoc,’ ‘sans\_global\_anhedonia,’ and ‘sans\_factor\_avolition’), some pattern of connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and other networks did emerge as an important set of predictor variables. In particular, the predictive edges between the DMN and other networks mostly originate from the anterior cingulate and/or the medial orbitofrontal lobe, regions that have previously been implicated in anhedonia. In addition, DMN connectivity is associated with depressive and negative symptoms. DMN variability increases in SZ patients with depression and correlates with this symptom score. Additionally, hypoconnectivity in the DMN is found in patients with SZ and psychotic bipolar disorder where connectivity was negatively correlated with negative. DMN within- and between-network connectivity is also altered in mood and psychotic disorders and tied to reduced reward responsiveness (a proxy for anhedonia). {\textbar} {\textbar} The present disclosure includes a data-driven method to search for improved biomarkers and to show the representation of the most predictive features at a high level. Other high-dimensional datasets, such as genetic expression data, may also benefit from an importance-weighted forward modeling approach to find which genes are most predictive of which symptoms. Clustering methods can provide one way to reduce the dimensionality by grouping genes by similarity. Feature selection may also benefit from grouping or selecting variables by predictability rather than similarity. While cross-validation on held-out test sets is meant to minimize overfitting, some models returned p{\textgreater}n and thus may still be susceptible to overfitting. But models which perform feature selection such as Elastic Net are designed to work on problems where p{\textgreater}{\textgreater}n and may help to reduce overfitting. {\textbar} {\textbar} Additional Embodiments {\textbar} {\textbar} Further aspects of the present disclosure include the following method: Clinical scale data, resting-state functional-MRI data, and structural-MRI scans are received for multiple patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), or healthy controls. The received data are preprocessed. At least one logistic regression model of features in the received data is generated. A set of predictive phenotypic features in the received data is generated based on weights generated from the at least one logistic regression model. {\textbar} {\textbar} Additional aspects of the present disclosure include the following computing system: A computer system includes at least one database, a memory, and a processor. The at least one database stores clinical scale data, resting-state functional-MRI data, and structural-MRI scans for multiple patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, or healthy controls. The memory stores computer instructions. The processor is configured to execute the computer instructions to preprocess the data stored in the at least one database. At least one logistic regression model of features in the received data is generated. A set of predictive phenotypic features in the received data is generated based on weights generated from the at least one logistic regression model. {\textbar} {\textbar} Still further aspects of the present disclosure include a system for evaluating a patient for mental health issues. The system includes a display, a user interface, a memory, and a control system. The memory contains machine readable medium. The machine readable medium includes machine executable code storing instructions for performing a method. The control system is coupled to the memory, and includes one or more processors. The control system is configured to execute the machine executable code to cause the control system to perform the method: On the display, a series of questions is displayed. The series of questions is from mental health questionnaires. The series of questions includes text and answers for each question. From the user interface, a selection of answers is received from a patient of each of the series of questions. A set of MRI data output is received after scanning the patient's brain using magnetic resonance imaging. Using a machine learning model, the selection of answers and the set of MRI data are processed to output an indication of the mental health of the patient. In some aspects, the mental health includes neuropsychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, and bi-polar disorder. {\textbar} {\textbar} Still additional aspects of the present disclosure include a machine learning based approach to build robust data-driven transdiagnostic classifiers to distinguish SCZ, BD, and ADHD patients from healthy controls (HCs) based on the openly available CNP dataset is described. Multiple data modalities are utilized, including clinical behavioral/symptom phenotypes and neuroimaging data (sMRI and fMRI) to obtain the optimal transdiagnostic models. Specifically, feature-importance guided sequential model selection approach is adopted in which classifiers were first built based on full sets of features to extract the feature importance and then from which a series of truncated models were built and evaluated to obtain the model producing the best performance. All transdiagnostic classifiers achieved very high performance in classifying various patient cohorts from healthy controls. More importantly, this feature and model selection approach not only allowed for the finding of the most robust transdiagnostic classifier but also identify the corresponding subset of most predictive features shared commonly across SCZ, BD, and ADHD patients. These shared features are reported and the identified latent abnormal psychopathological structure across these psychiatric disorders is discussed. {\textbar} {\textbar} Although the present disclosure provides for models trained on the CNP database, the present disclosure contemplates that any database comprising clinical scales data and MRI data can be used to produce models, as would be readily contemplated by one skilled in the art. {\textbar} {\textbar} The disclosed models selected as informative the features which trend in the same direction for all participants. The present disclosure contemplates that brain activity can be examined which diverges between patient groups; such an approach can yield other features. {\textbar} {\textbar} Although the present disclosure discusses input primarily in terms of fMRI data and sMRI data, other embodiments can provide for receiving rs-fMRI. {\textbar} {\textbar} Altogether, the present disclosure provides a data-driven way to improve biomarker development for predicting symptom severity transdiagnostically and can be used in a personalized medicine approach in diagnosing and treating behavioral disorders. {\textbar} {\textbar} Machine Learning Implementation {\textbar} {\textbar} Various aspects of the present disclosure can be performed by a machine-learning algorithm, as readily understood by a person skilled in the art. In some examples, step {\textbar} {\textbar} 2940 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 29 {\textbar} and methodology {\textbar} 3000 {\textbar} of {\textbar} FIG. 30 {\textbar} can be performed by a supervised or unsupervised algorithm. For instance, the system may utilize more basic machine learning tools including 1) decision trees (“DT”), (2) Bayesian networks (“BN”), (3) artificial neural network (“ANN”), or (4) support vector machines (“SVM”). In other examples, deep learning algorithms or other more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural networks (“CNN”), or capsule networks (“CapsNet”) may be used. {\textbar} DT are classification graphs that match input data to questions asked at each consecutive step in a decision tree. The DT program moves down the “branches” of the tree based on the answers to the questions (e.g., First branch: Did the clinical scales data include certain input? yes or no. Branch two: Did the MRI data include certain features? yes or no, etc.). {\textbar} {\textbar} Bayesian networks (“BN”) are based on likelihood something is true based on given independent variables and are modeled based on probabilistic relationships. BN are based purely on probabilistic relationships that determine the likelihood of one variable based on another or others. For example, BN can model the relationships between MRI data, clinical scales data, and any other information as contemplated by the present disclosure. Particularly, if a question type and particular features of the patient's MRI data are known, a BN can be used to compute a symptom severity indicator. Thus, using an efficient BN algorithm, an inference can be made based on the input data. {\textbar} {\textbar} Artificial neural networks (“ANN”) are computational models inspired by an animal's central nervous system. They map inputs to outputs through a network of nodes. However, unlike BN, in ANN the nodes do not necessarily represent any actual variable. Accordingly, ANN may have a hidden layer of nodes that are not represented by a known variable to an observer. ANNs are capable of pattern recognition. Their computing methods make it easier to understand a complex and unclear process that might go on during determining a symptom severity indicator based on a variety of input data. {\textbar} {\textbar} Support vector machines (“SVM”) came about from a framework utilizing of machine learning statistics and vector spaces (linear algebra concept that signifies the number of dimensions in linear space) equipped with some kind of limit-related structure. In some cases, they may determine a new coordinate system that easily separates inputs into two classifications. For example, a SVM could identify a line that separates two sets of points originating from different classifications of events. {\textbar} {\textbar} Deep neural networks (DNN) have developed recently and are capable of modeling very complex relationships that have a lot of variation. Various architectures of DNN have been proposed to tackle the problems associated with algorithms such as ANN by many researchers during the last few decades. These types of DNN are CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) etc. They are all based on the theory of ANN. They demonstrate a better performance by overcoming the back-propagation error diminishing problem associated with ANN. {\textbar} {\textbar} Machine learning models require training data to identify the features of interest that they are designed to detect. For instance, various methods may be utilized to form the machine learning models, including applying randomly assigned initial weights for the network and applying gradient descent using back propagation for deep learning algorithms. In other examples, a neural network with one or two hidden layers can be used without training using this technique. {\textbar} {\textbar} In some examples, the machine learning model can be trained using labeled data, or data that represents certain user input. In other examples, the data will only be labeled with the outcome and the various relevant data may be input to train the machine learning algorithm. {\textbar} {\textbar} For instance, to determine whether particular mental health disorder fits the input data, various machine learning models may be utilized that input various data disclosed herein. In some examples, the input data will be labeled by having an expert in the field label the relevant regulations according to the particular situation. Accordingly, the input to the machine learning algorithm for training data identifies various data as from a healthy control or from a patient. {\textbar} {\textbar} Exemplary NMR System {\textbar} {\textbar} Referring now to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 31A-32 {\textbar} , the methods and embodiments of the present disclosure can be performed on an exemplary nuclear magnetic resonance (“NMR system”). As a person of ordinary skill in the art understands, NMR commonly refers to the hardware used to generate different types of scans, including MRI scans. Referring now to {\textbar} FIGS. 31A-32 {\textbar} , there is shown the major components of an NMR system which can be used to carry out the methods of the various embodiments. {\textbar} FIG. 32 {\textbar} shows the components of an exemplary transceiver for the NMR system of {\textbar} FIGS. 31A-31B {\textbar} . It should be noted that the methods of the various embodiments can also be carried out using other NMR systems. {\textbar} The operation of the system of {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 31A-32 {\textbar} is controlled from an operator console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} which includes a console processor {\textbar} 101 {\textbar} that scans a keyboard {\textbar} 102 {\textbar} and receives inputs from a human operator through a control panel {\textbar} 103 {\textbar} and a plasma display/touch screen {\textbar} 104 {\textbar} . The console processor {\textbar} 101 {\textbar} communicates through a communications link {\textbar} 116 {\textbar} with an applications interface module {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} in a separate computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} . Through the keyboard {\textbar} 102 {\textbar} and controls {\textbar} 103 {\textbar} , an operator controls the production and display of images by an image processor {\textbar} 106 {\textbar} in the computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} , which connects directly to a video display {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} on the console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} through a video cable {\textbar} 105 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The computer system {\textbar} {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} is formed about a backplane bus which conforms with the VME standards, and it includes a number of modules which communicate with each other through this backplane. In addition to the application interface {\textbar} 117 {\textbar} and the image processor {\textbar} 106 {\textbar} , these include a CPU module {\textbar} 108 {\textbar} that controls the VME backplane, and an SCSI interface module {\textbar} 109 {\textbar} that connects the computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} through a bus {\textbar} 110 {\textbar} to a set of peripheral devices, including disk storage {\textbar} 111 {\textbar} and tape drive {\textbar} 112 {\textbar} . The computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} also includes a memory module {\textbar} 113 {\textbar} , known in the art as a frame buffer for storing image data arrays, and a serial interface module {\textbar} 114 {\textbar} that links the computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} through a high speed serial link {\textbar} 115 {\textbar} to a system interface module {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} located in a separate system control cabinet {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The system control {\textbar} {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} includes a series of modules which are connected together by a common backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} . The backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} is comprised of a number of bus structures, including a bus structure which is controlled by a CPU module {\textbar} 119 {\textbar} . The serial interface module {\textbar} 120 {\textbar} connects this backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} to the high speed serial link {\textbar} 115 {\textbar} , and pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} connects the backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} to the operator console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} through a serial link {\textbar} 125 {\textbar} . It is through this link {\textbar} 125 {\textbar} that the system control {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} receives commands from the operator which indicate the scan sequence that is to be performed. {\textbar} The pulse generator module {\textbar} {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} operates the system components to carry out the desired scan sequence. It produces data which indicates the timing, strength and shape of the RF pulses which are to be produced, and the timing of and length of the data acquisition window. The pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} also connects through serial link {\textbar} 126 {\textbar} to a set of gradient amplifiers {\textbar} 127 {\textbar} , and it conveys data thereto which indicates the timing and shape of the gradient pulses that are to be produced during the scan. The pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} also receives patient data through a serial link {\textbar} 128 {\textbar} from a physiological acquisition controller {\textbar} 129 {\textbar} . The physiological acquisition control {\textbar} 129 {\textbar} can receive a signal from a number of different sensors connected to the patient. For example, it may receive ECG signals from electrodes or respiratory signals from a bellows and produce pulses for the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} that synchronizes the scan with the patient's cardiac cycle or respiratory cycle. And finally, the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} connects through a serial link {\textbar} 132 {\textbar} to scan room interface circuit {\textbar} 133 {\textbar} which receives signals at inputs {\textbar} 135 {\textbar} from various sensors associated with the position and condition of the patient and the magnet system. It is also through the scan room interface circuit {\textbar} 133 {\textbar} that a patient positioning system {\textbar} 134 {\textbar} receives commands which move the patient cradle and transport the patient to the desired position for the scan. {\textbar} The gradient waveforms produced by the pulse generator module {\textbar} {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} are applied to a gradient amplifier system {\textbar} 127 {\textbar} comprised of Gx, Gy, and Gz amplifiers {\textbar} 136 {\textbar} , {\textbar} 137 {\textbar} and {\textbar} 138 {\textbar} , respectively. Each amplifier {\textbar} 136 {\textbar} , {\textbar} 137 {\textbar} , and {\textbar} 138 {\textbar} is utilized to excite a corresponding gradient coil in an assembly generally designated {\textbar} 139 {\textbar} . The gradient coil assembly {\textbar} 139 {\textbar} forms part of a magnet assembly {\textbar} 155 {\textbar} which includes a polarizing magnet {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} that produces a 1.5 Tesla polarizing field that extends horizontally through a bore. The gradient coils {\textbar} 139 {\textbar} encircle the bore, and when energized, they generate magnetic fields in the same direction as the main polarizing magnetic field, but with gradients Gx, Gy and Gz directed in the orthogonal x-, y- and z-axis directions of a Cartesian coordinate system. That is, if the magnetic field generated by the main magnet {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} is directed in the z direction and is termed BO, and the total magnetic field in the z direction is referred to as Bz, then Gx∂Bz/∂x, Gy=∂Bz/∂y and Gz=∂Bz/∂z, and the magnetic field at any point (x,y,z) in the bore of the magnet assembly {\textbar} 155 {\textbar} is given by B(x,y,z)=Bo+Gxx+GyyGzz. The gradient magnetic fields are utilized to encode spatial information into the NMR signals emanating from the patient being scanned. Because the gradient fields are switched at a very high speed when an EPI sequence is used to practice the preferred embodiment of the invention, local gradient coils are employed in place of the whole-body gradient coils {\textbar} 139 {\textbar} . These local gradient coils are designed for the head and are in close proximity thereto. This enables the inductance of the local gradient coils to be reduced and the gradient switching rates increased as required for the EPI pulse sequence. For a description of these local gradient coils which is incorporated herein by reference, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,137 issued on Dec. 13, 1994, and entitled “NMR Local Coil for Brain Imaging”. {\textbar} Located within the bore {\textbar} {\textbar} 142 {\textbar} is a circular cylindrical whole-body RF coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} . This coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} produces a circularly polarized RF field in response to RF pulses provided by a transceiver module {\textbar} 150 {\textbar} in the system control cabinet {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} . These pulses are amplified by an RF amplifier {\textbar} 151 {\textbar} and coupled to the RF coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} by a transmit/receive switch {\textbar} 154 {\textbar} which forms an integral part of the RF coil assembly. Waveforms and control signals are provided by the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} and utilized by the transceiver module {\textbar} 150 {\textbar} for RF carrier modulation and mode control. The resulting NMR signals radiated by the excited nuclei in the patient may be sensed by the same RF coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} and coupled through the transmit/receive switch {\textbar} 154 {\textbar} to a preamplifier {\textbar} 153 {\textbar} . The amplified NMR signals are demodulated, filtered, and digitized in the receiver section of the transceiver {\textbar} 150 {\textbar} . {\textbar} The transmit/receive switch {\textbar} {\textbar} 154 {\textbar} is controlled by a signal from the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} to electrically connect the RF amplifier {\textbar} 151 {\textbar} to the coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} during the transmit mode and to connect the preamplifier {\textbar} 153 {\textbar} during the receive mode. The transmit/receive switch {\textbar} 154 {\textbar} also enables a separate local RF head coil to be used in the transmit and receive mode to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the received NMR signals. With currently available NMR systems such a local RF coil is preferred in order to detect small variations in NMR signal. Reference is made to the above cited U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,137 for a description of the preferred local RF coil. {\textbar} In addition to supporting the polarizing magnet {\textbar} {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} and the gradient coils {\textbar} 139 {\textbar} and RF coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} , the main magnet assembly {\textbar} 155 {\textbar} also supports a set of shim coils {\textbar} 156 {\textbar} associated with the main magnet {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} and used to correct inhomogeneities in the polarizing magnet field. The main power supply {\textbar} 157 {\textbar} is utilized to bring the polarizing field produced by the superconductive main magnet {\textbar} 140 {\textbar} to the proper operating strength and is then removed. {\textbar} The NMR signals picked up by the RF coil are digitized by the transceiver module {\textbar} {\textbar} 150 {\textbar} and transferred to a memory module {\textbar} 160 {\textbar} which is also part of the system control {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} . When the scan is completed and an entire array of data has been acquired in the memory modules {\textbar} 160 {\textbar} , an array processor {\textbar} 161 {\textbar} operates to Fourier transform the data into an array of image data. This image data is conveyed through the serial link {\textbar} 115 {\textbar} to the computer system {\textbar} 107 {\textbar} where it is stored in the disk memory {\textbar} 111 {\textbar} . In response to commands received from the operator console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} , this image data may be archived on the tape drive {\textbar} 112 {\textbar} , or it may be further processed by the image processor {\textbar} 106 {\textbar} and conveyed to the operator console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} and presented on the video display {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} as will be described in more detail hereinafter. {\textbar} Referring particularly to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIG. 32 {\textbar} , the transceiver {\textbar} 150 {\textbar} includes components which produce the RF excitation field B {\textbar} 1 {\textbar} through power amplifier {\textbar} 151 {\textbar} at a coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} A and components which receive the resulting NMR signal induced in a coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} B. As indicated above, the coils {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} A and B may be a single whole-body coil, but the best results are achieved with a single local RF coil specially designed for the head. The base or carrier frequency of the RF excitation field is produced under control of a frequency synthesizer {\textbar} 200 {\textbar} which receives a set of digital signals (CF) through the backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} from the CPU module {\textbar} 119 {\textbar} and pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} . These digital signals indicate the frequency and phase of the RF carrier signal, which is produced at an output {\textbar} 201 {\textbar} . The commanded RF carrier is applied to a modulator and up converter {\textbar} 202 {\textbar} where its amplitude is modulated in response to a signal R(t) also received through the backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} from the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} . The signal R(t) defines the envelope, and therefore the bandwidth, of the RF excitation pulse to be produced. It is produced in the module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} by sequentially reading out a series of stored digital values that represent the; desired envelope. These stored digital values may, in turn, be changed from the operator console {\textbar} 100 {\textbar} to enable any desired RF pulse envelope to be produced. The modulator and up converter {\textbar} 202 {\textbar} produces an RF pulse at the desired Larmor frequency at an output {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} . The magnitude of the RF excitation pulse output through line {\textbar} 205 {\textbar} is attenuated by an exciter attenuator circuit {\textbar} 206 {\textbar} which receives a digital command, TA, from the backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} . The attenuated RF excitation pulses are applied to the power amplifier {\textbar} 151 {\textbar} that drives the RF coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} A. For a more detailed description of this portion of the transceiver {\textbar} 122 {\textbar} , reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,877, which is incorporated herein by reference. {\textbar} Referring still to {\textbar} {\textbar} FIGS. 31A-32 {\textbar} , the NMR signal produced by the subject is picked up by the receiver coil {\textbar} 152 {\textbar} B and applied through the preamplifier {\textbar} 153 {\textbar} to the input of a receiver attenuator {\textbar} 207 {\textbar} . The receiver attenuator {\textbar} 207 {\textbar} further amplifies the NMR signal, and this is attenuated by an amount determined by a digital attenuation signal (RA) received from the backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} . The receive attenuator {\textbar} 207 {\textbar} is also turned on and off by a signal from the pulse generator module {\textbar} 121 {\textbar} such that it is not overloaded during RF excitation. The received NMR signal is at or around the Larmor frequency, which in the preferred embodiment is around 63.86 MHz for 1.5 Tesla. This high-frequency signal is down-converted in a two-step process by a down converter {\textbar} 208 {\textbar} which first mixes the NMR signal with the carrier signal on line {\textbar} 201 {\textbar} and then mixes the resulting difference signal with the 2.5 MHz reference signal on line {\textbar} 204 {\textbar} . The resulting down-converted NMR signal on line {\textbar} 212 {\textbar} has a maximum bandwidth of 125 kHz, and it is centered at a frequency of 187.5 kHz. The down-converted NMR signal is applied to the input of an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter {\textbar} 209 {\textbar} , which samples and digitizes the analog signal at a rate of 250 kHz. The output of the A/D converter {\textbar} 209 {\textbar} is applied to a digital detector, and signal processor {\textbar} 210 {\textbar} which produce 16-bit in-phase (I) values and 16-bit quadrature (Q) values corresponding to the received digital signal. The resulting stream of digitized I and Q values of the received NMR signal is output through backplane {\textbar} 118 {\textbar} to the memory module {\textbar} 160 {\textbar} where they are employed to reconstruct an image. {\textbar} To preserve the phase information contained in the received NMR signal, both the modulator and up converter {\textbar} {\textbar} 202 {\textbar} in the exciter section and the down converter {\textbar} 208 {\textbar} in the receiver section are operated with common signals. More particularly, the carrier signal at the output {\textbar} 201 {\textbar} of the frequency synthesizer {\textbar} 200 {\textbar} and the 2.5 MHz reference signal at the output {\textbar} 204 {\textbar} of the reference frequency generator {\textbar} 203 {\textbar} are employed in both frequency conversion processes. Phase consistency is thus maintained, and phase changes in the detected NMR signal accurately indicate phase changes produced by the excited spins. The 2.5 MHz reference signal as well as 5, 10 and 60 MHz reference signals are produced by the reference frequency generator {\textbar} 203 {\textbar} from a common 20 MHz master clock signal. The latter three reference signals are employed by the frequency synthesizer {\textbar} 200 {\textbar} to produce the carrier signal on output {\textbar} 201 {\textbar} . For a more detailed description of the receiver, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,736, which is incorporated herein by reference. {\textbar} Computer \& Hardware Implementation of Disclosure {\textbar} {\textbar} It should initially be understood that the disclosure herein may be implemented with any type of hardware and/or software, and may be a pre-programmed general purpose computing device. For example, the system may be implemented using a server, a personal computer, a portable computer, a thin client, or any suitable device or devices. The disclosure and/or components thereof may be a single device at a single location, or multiple devices at a single, or multiple, locations that are connected together using any appropriate communication protocols over any communication medium such as electric cable, fiber optic cable, or in a wireless manner. {\textbar} {\textbar} It should also be noted that the disclosure is illustrated and discussed herein as having a plurality of modules which perform particular functions. It should be understood that these modules are merely schematically illustrated based on their function for clarity purposes only, and do not necessary represent specific hardware or software. In this regard, these modules may be hardware and/or software implemented to substantially perform the particular functions discussed. Moreover, the modules may be combined together within the disclosure, or divided into additional modules based on the particular function desired. Thus, the disclosure should not be construed to limit the present invention, but merely be understood to illustrate one example implementation thereof. {\textbar} {\textbar} The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server. {\textbar} {\textbar} Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data server) or a middleware component (e.g., an application server) or a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification) or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks). {\textbar} {\textbar} Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs (e.g., one or more modules of computer program instructions) encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal (e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal) that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). {\textbar} {\textbar} The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by a “data processing apparatus” on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources. {\textbar} {\textbar} The term “data processing apparatus” encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations, of the foregoing The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question (e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them). The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing, and grid computing infrastructures. {\textbar} {\textbar} A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network. {\textbar} {\textbar} The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)). {\textbar} {\textbar} Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data (e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks). However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device (e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few). Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices (e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks). The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry. {\textbar} {\textbar} CONCLUSION {\textbar} {\textbar} The various methods and techniques described above provide a number of ways to carry out the invention.

	abstract = {With the introduction of new devices, industries are turning to virtual reality to innovate their product development processes. However, before the technology’s possibilities can be fully harnessed, certain constraints must be overcome. This study identifies the benefits and challenges of virtual-reality-based usability testing and design reviews in industry through a patents and articles review. We searched Derwent Innovation, Scopus, and Web of Science and identified 7 patent filings and 20 articles. We discovered an increase in patent filings since 2016 and strong development in the technology space, offering opportunities to enter an area while it is still young. The most frequently researched field is the automotive industry and the most used device is the HTC VIVE head-mounted display, which is frequently paired with motion capture systems and Unity 3D game engines. Virtual reality benefits design reviews and usability testing by providing the visualization of new angles that stimulate novel insights, increasing team engagement, offering more intuitive interactions for non-CAD specialists, saving redesign cost and time, and increasing participants’ safety. The challenges faced by virtual-reality-based prototypes are a lack of realism due to unnatural tactile and visual interactions, latency and registration issues, communication difficulties between teams, and unpleasant symptoms. While these constraints prevent virtual reality from replacing conventional design reviews and usability testing in the near future, it is already a valuable contribution to the industrial product development process.},

As technology is advancing rapidly, it is critical to understand the current state of AI applications in DP. Therefore, a patent analysis of AI in DP is required to assess the application and publication trends, major assignees, and leaders in the field. We searched five major patent databases, namely, those of the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, JPO, and CNIPA, from 1974 to 2021, using keywords such as DP, AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We discovered 6284 patents, 523 of which were used for trend analyses on time series, international distribution, top assignees; word cloud analysis; and subject category analyses. Patent filing and publication have increased exponentially over the past five years. The United States has published the most patents, followed by China and South Korea (248, 117, and 48, respectively). The top assignees were Paige.AI, Inc. (New York City, NY, USA) and Siemens, Inc. (Munich, Germany) The primary areas were whole-slide imaging, segmentation, classification, and detection. Based on these findings, we expect a surge in DP and AI patent applications focusing on the digitalization of pathological images and AI technologies that support the vital role of pathologists.},

	abstract = {This piece of research is focused on providing a review of the software solutions that exist when it comes to mechanisms that govern the management of intellectual property. It takes a deeper look at requirements within the university transfer office domain. Universities are a genuine source of knowledge. They have been identified not just as knowledge hubs but also as the spaces where innovations are born. These innovations then make their way into the market through the different industries they serve, becoming products that gain the attention of actual consumers. Given the magnitude of the innovations being developed in different universities around the world, it is imperative that mechanisms for the safety of this knowledge also be put into place. The world has evolved into a knowledge economy, where knowledge is an asset and something that can create profitability. This means that not protecting the knowledge that is being created can only lead to a loss in the future. Managing intellectual property, therefore, is not only a matter of procedure but one of great importance. Solutions that are easily accessible, cost-effective, and time-effective are essential. Thus, the goal of this article is to provide an overview of existing software (SW) solutions suitable for managing technology and knowledge transfer at universities based on requirements from the technology transfer office at university and specified using the model of the whole process from inventor until patent office. University Technology Transfer (TT) is a bit different in comparison to TT at companies. This gap is shown in the article using modelling of process, states, and class diagrams of a university Technology Transfer Office (TTO). Based on process definition and TTO responsibilities, a review of available SW solutions is done for 10 selected examples, as well as a related literature analysis. Findings and implications are summarized at the end of article in the context of specific needs of a university TTO, while major implications are shown as a problem of priority definition of every university TTO, namely, in the sense of value of SW solutions for intellectual property (IP) management, reporting possibilities, and representing IP and know-how.},

	abstract = {Despite a longstanding and widespread influence of the diagnostic approach to mental ill health, there is an emerging and growing consensus that such psychiatric nosologies may no longer be fit for purpose in research and clinical practice. In their place, there is gathering support for a 'transdiagnostic' approach that cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries or, more radically, sets them aside altogether, to provide novel insights into how we might understand mental health difficulties. Removing the distinctions between proposed psychiatric taxa at the level of classification opens up new ways of classifying mental health problems, suggests alternative conceptualizations of the processes implicated in mental health, and provides a platform for novel ways of thinking about onset, maintenance, and clinical treatment and recovery from experiences of disabling mental distress. In this Introduction to a Special Section on Transdiagnostic Approaches to Psychopathology, we provide a narrative review of the transdiagnostic literature in order to situate the Special Section articles in context. We begin with a brief history of the diagnostic approach and outline several challenges it currently faces that arguably limit its applicability in current mental health science and practice. We then review several recent transdiagnostic approaches to classification, biopsychosocial processes, and clinical interventions, highlighting promising novel developments. Finally, we present some key challenges facing transdiagnostic science and make suggestions for a way forward. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field.},

	abstract = {Background
Antidepressant treatment efficacy is low, but might be improved by matching patients to interventions. At present, clinicians have no empirically validated mechanisms to assess whether a patient with depression will respond to a specific antidepressant. We aimed to develop an algorithm to assess whether patients will achieve symptomatic remission from a 12-week course of citalopram.
Methods
We used patient-reported data from patients with depression (n=4041, with 1949 completers) from level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D; ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00021528) to identify variables that were most predictive of treatment outcome, and used these variables to train a machine-learning model to predict clinical remission. We externally validated the model in the escitalopram treatment group (n=151) of an independent clinical trial (Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes [COMED]; ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00590863).
Findings
We identified 25 variables that were most predictive of treatment outcome from 164 patient-reportable variables, and used these to train the model. The model was internally cross-validated, and predicted outcomes in the STAR*D cohort with accuracy significantly above chance (64·6\% [SD 3·2]; p{\textless}0·0001). The model was externally validated in the escitalopram treatment group (N=151) of COMED (accuracy 59·6\%, p=0.043). The model also performed significantly above chance in a combined escitalopram-buproprion treatment group in COMED (n=134; accuracy 59·7\%, p=0·023), but not in a combined venlafaxine-mirtazapine group (n=140; accuracy 51·4\%, p=0·53), suggesting specificity of the model to underlying mechanisms.
Interpretation
Building statistical models by mining existing clinical trial data can enable prospective identification of patients who are likely to respond to a specific antidepressant.

	abstract = {Although there have been tremendous advances in the understanding of human dysfunctions in the brain circuitry for self-reflection, emotion, and cognitive control, a brain-based taxonomy for mental disease is still lacking. As a result, these advances have not been translated into actionable clinical tools, and the language of brain circuits has not been incorporated into training programmes. To address this gap, I present this synthesis of published work, with a focus on functional imaging of circuit dysfunctions across the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders. This synthesis provides the foundation for a taxonomy of putative types of dysfunction, which cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries for depression and anxiety and includes instead distinct types of neural circuit dysfunction that together reflect the heterogeneity of depression and anxiety. This taxonomy is suited to specifying symptoms in terms of underlying neural dysfunction at the individual level and is intended as the foundation for building mechanistic research and ultimately guiding clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the explosion of molecular data on humans-particularly data associated with individual patients-and the sense that there are large, as-yet-untapped opportunities to use this data to improve health outcomes, Toward Precision Medicine explores the feasibility and need for "a new taxonomy of human disease based on molecular biology" and develops a potential framework for creating one. The book says that a new data network that integrates emerging research on the molecular makeup of diseases with clinical data on individual patients could drive the development of a more accurate classification of diseases and ultimately enhance diagnosis and treatment. The "new taxonomy" that emerges would define diseases by their underlying molecular causes and other factors in addition to their traditional physical signs and symptoms. The book adds that the new data network could also improve biomedical research by enabling scientists to access patients' information during treatment while still protecting their rights. This would allow the marriage of molecular research and clinical data at the point of care, as opposed to research information continuing to reside primarily in academia. Toward Precision Medicine notes that moving toward individualized medicine requires that researchers and health care providers have access to very large sets of health- and disease-related data linked to individual patients. These data are also critical for developing the information commons, the knowledge network of disease, and ultimately the new taxonomy.},
